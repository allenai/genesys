    "review": "### Comprehensive Analysis of the Raptor Proposal\n\n#### Clarity\nThe Raptor proposal is clearly articulated, with well-defined objectives focusing on integrating Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression techniques. The design plan is detailed, providing a clear architectural overview and mathematical formulations for each component. The proposal effectively communicates the motivation behind the integration and the expected benefits in terms of efficiency, scalability, and robustness.\n\n#### Innovation\nThe proposal introduces innovative improvements by combining three significant techniques: Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention, and sparse memory compression. This integration is novel as it aims to address the computational and memory challenges in transformer models holistically. Compared to existing research, such as Luna and Lightning Attention-2, Raptor's approach to combining these techniques in a cohesive manner is unique and has the potential to offer substantial improvements in model performance and efficiency.\n\n#### Feasibility\nThe proposed design appears feasible within the given framework. The use of well-established components like linear attention and RMSNorm, along with the addition of sparse memory compression, suggests that the design can be implemented successfully. However, the integration of these components may require careful tuning and optimization to ensure stability and performance.\n\n#### Scalability\nThe design is expected to scale efficiently with larger models and more data due to the linear attention mechanisms and sparse memory compression. These techniques reduce the computational complexity and memory usage, making the model more suitable for handling long sequences and large datasets.\n\n#### Accuracy and Robustness\nThe integration of Adaptive RMSNorm is likely to enhance the model's robustness and stability by dynamically adjusting normalization parameters based on input distributions. This adaptability can improve the model's ability to handle diverse inputs and maintain accuracy across different tasks.\n\n#### Efficiency\nThe proposal offers potential improvements in computational efficiency and memory usage. Linear attention mechanisms reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, and sparse memory compression optimizes memory usage by focusing on essential hidden states. These improvements are crucial for enhancing the model's efficiency, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Strengths and Concerns\n**Strengths:**\n- Clear articulation and well-defined objectives.\n- Novel integration of Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention, and sparse memory compression.\n- Potential for significant improvements in efficiency, scalability, and robustness.\n- Feasibility of implementation with existing techniques.\n\n**Concerns:**\n- The integration of multiple components may introduce complexity and require careful tuning.\n- Stability during training needs to be ensured, especially with adaptive mechanisms.\n- The impact on accuracy and robustness should be empirically validated.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n1. **Empirical Validation:** Conduct empirical studies to validate the theoretical benefits and assess the impact on accuracy and robustness.\n2. **Stability Analysis:** Provide a more detailed analysis of stability during training and propose strategies to mitigate potential issues.\n3. **Integration Guidelines:** Offer more specific guidelines for integrating the components to ensure coherent functionality and performance.\n4. **Performance Metrics:** Define clear performance metrics to evaluate the improvements in efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Final Rating\nBased on the proposal's clarity, innovation, feasibility, scalability, and potential impact on efficiency and robustness, I assign a rating of **4.3 out of 5**. The proposal is well-conceived and offers valuable improvements over existing approaches, but it requires empirical validation and careful integration to realize its full potential.",

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07289, 2015.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/28 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Enhancing Content Preservation in Text Style Transfer Using Reverse Attention and Conditional Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Dongkyu Lee, Zhiliang Tian, Lanqing Xue, N. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention, and thereby retain the content, and creates not only style-independent content representation, but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style.\n\n**Abstract:** Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence while preserving its content. A common approach is to map a given sentence to content representation that is free of style, and the content representation is fed to a decoder with a target style. Previous methods in filtering style completely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss of content information. In this paper, we propose to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention, and thereby retain the content. Furthermore, we fuse content information when building the target style representation, making it dynamic with respect to the content. Our method creates not only style-independent content representation, but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation. In addition, it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and fluency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. Dodo: Dynamic Contextual Compression for Decoder-only LMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Guanghui Qin, Corby Rosset, Ethan C. Chau, Nikhil Rao, Benjamin Van Durme*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dodo is proposed, a solution for context compression that represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are inefficient in long contexts. We propose Dodo, a solution for context compression. Instead of one vector per token in a standard transformer model, Dodo represents text with a dynamic number of hidden states at each layer, reducing the cost of self-attention to a fraction of typical time and space. Moreover, off-the-shelf models such as LLaMA can be adapted to Dodo by efficient parameter tuning methods such as LoRA. In use, Dodo can act as either an autoregressive LM or a context compressor for downstream tasks. We demonstrate through experiments in language modeling, question answering, and summarization that Dodo retains capabilities in these tasks, while drastically reducing the overhead during decoding. For example, in the autoencoding task, Dodo shrinks context at a 20x compression ratio with a BLEU score of 98% for reconstruction, achieving nearly lossless encoding.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Train Faster, Perform Better: Modular Adaptive Training in Over-Parameterized Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Attention Scaling\"*\n\n*Yubin Shi, Yixuan Chen, Mingzhi Dong, Xiaochen Yang, Dongsheng Li, Yujiang Wang, Robert P. Dick, Qin Lv, Yingying Zhao, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, L. Shang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy and proposes a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT), which can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their prevalence in deep-learning communities, over-parameterized models convey high demands of computational costs for proper training. This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy. Empirical evidence reveals that when scaling down into network modules, such as heads in self-attention models, we can observe varying learning patterns implicitly associated with each module's trainability. To describe such modular-level learning capabilities, we introduce a novel concept dubbed modular neural tangent kernel (mNTK), and we demonstrate that the quality of a module's learning is tightly associated with its mNTK's principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A large $\\lambda_{\\max}$ indicates that the module learns features with better convergence, while those miniature ones may impact generalization negatively. Inspired by the discovery, we propose a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT) to update those modules with their $\\lambda_{\\max}$ exceeding a dynamic threshold selectively, concentrating the model on learning common features and ignoring those inconsistent ones. Unlike most existing training schemes with a complete BP cycle across all network modules, MAT can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance. Experiments show that MAT nearly halves the computational cost of model training and outperforms the accuracy of baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

In this work, we demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients: (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic scaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the training task distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform well across ever-larger open-ended domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 6. MVSFormer++: Revealing the Devil in Transformer's Details for Multi-View Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Attention Scaling\"*\n\n*Chenjie Cao, Xinlin Ren, Yanwei Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have prominently featured transformer-based models with attention mechanisms. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Balancing Cost and Benefit with Tied-Multi Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Raj Dabre, Raphael Rubino, Atsushi Fujita*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose and evaluate a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers\nwith tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the\ndynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the\nN-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last\ndecoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single\nloss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of\none of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a\nmodel subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers,\nand can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and\ndecoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of\nencoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent\nstacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present\na cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine\ntranslation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving\ntranslation quality.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-20T08:20:52Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-20T08:20:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Manifold-Preserving Transformers are Effective for Short-Long Range\n  Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Attention Scaling\"*\n\n*Ayan Sengupta, Md Shad Akhtar, Tanmoy Chakraborty*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head self-attention-based Transformers have shown promise in different\nlearning tasks. Albeit these models exhibit significant improvement in\nunderstanding short-term and long-term contexts from sequences, encoders of\nTransformers and their variants fail to preserve layer-wise contextual\ninformation. Transformers usually project tokens onto sparse manifolds and fail\nto preserve mathematical equivalence among the token representations. In this\nwork, we propose TransJect, an encoder model that guarantees a theoretical\nbound for layer-wise distance preservation between a pair of tokens. We propose\na simple alternative to dot-product attention to ensure Lipschitz continuity.\nThis allows TransJect to learn injective mappings to transform token\nrepresentations to different manifolds with similar topology and preserve\nEuclidean distance between every pair of tokens in subsequent layers.\nEvaluations across multiple benchmark short- and long-sequence classification\ntasks show maximum improvements of 6.8% and 5.9%, respectively, over the\nvariants of Transformers. Additionally, TransJect displays 79% better\nperformance than Transformer on the language modeling task. We further\nhighlight the shortcomings of multi-head self-attention from the statistical\nphysics viewpoint. Although multi-head self-attention was incepted to learn\ndifferent abstraction levels within the networks, our empirical analyses\nsuggest that different attention heads learn randomly and unorderly. In\ncontrast, TransJect adapts a mixture of experts for regularization; these\nexperts are more orderly and balanced and learn different sparse\nrepresentations from the input sequences. TransJect exhibits very low entropy\nand can be efficiently scaled to larger depths.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-22T06:58:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-22T06:58:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive Attention Scaling\"*\n\n*Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nimportant. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention\ncomputation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference\nlatency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors.\nThis paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both\naccelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By\nleveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention\nproposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV\nvectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search\nduring generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS\nindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention\nmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a\nsingle NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B\nparameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16T17:59:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-18T13:11:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Selective Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

In contrast to\nthe previous baselines which append every sentence representation to memory,\nconditionally selecting and appending them is a more reasonable solution to\ndeal with unlimited long sequences. Our model uses a policy that determines\nwhether the sequence should be kept in memory with a compressed state or\ndiscarded during the training process. With the benefits of retaining\nsemantically meaningful sentence information in the memory system, our\nexperiment results on Enwik8 benchmark show that DCT outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) model.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-10T15:21:19Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-10T15:21:19Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

In far-field conditions, signals are attenuated due to distance.\nTo improve robustness to loudness variation, we introduce a novel frontend\ncalled per-channel energy normalization (PCEN). The key ingredient of PCEN is\nthe use of an automatic gain control based dynamic compression to replace the\nwidely used static (such as log or root) compression. We evaluate PCEN on the\nkeyword spotting task. On our large rerecorded noisy and far-field eval sets,\nwe show that PCEN significantly improves recognition performance.

Stateful ODE-Nets using Basis Function Expansions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\"*\n\n*Michael W. Mahoney, Liam Hodgkinson, N. Benjamin Erichson, Alejandro Queiruga*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently-introduced class of ordinary differential equation networks (ODE-Nets) establishes a fruitful connection between deep learning and dynamical systems. In this work, we reconsider formulations of the weights as continuous-in-depth functions using linear combinations of basis functions which enables us to leverage parameter transformations such as function projections. In turn, this view allows us to formulate a novel stateful ODE-Block that handles stateful layers. The benefits of this new ODE-Block are twofold: first, it enables incorporating meaningful continuous-in-depth batch normalization layers to achieve state-of-the-art performance; second, it enables compressing the weights through a change of basis, without retraining, while maintaining near state-of-the-art performance and reducing both inference time and memory footprint. Performance is demonstrated by applying our stateful ODE-Block to (a) image classification tasks using convolutional units and (b) sentence-tagging tasks using transformer encoder units.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-21\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We introduce a\nnovel lossy compression algorithm for $N$-dimensional data over regular grids.\nIt leverages the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD), a\ngeneralization of the SVD to 3 and more dimensions, together with adaptive\nquantization, run-length and arithmetic coding to store the HOSVD transform\ncoefficients' relative positions as sorted by their absolute magnitude. Our\nscheme degrades the data particularly smoothly and outperforms other\nstate-of-the-art volume compressors at low-to-medium bit rates, as required in\ndata archiving and management for visualization purposes.

Here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n## Dynamic Layer Normalization Compression\n\n- The concept of dynamic layer normalization, as hinted in the analysis, involves adjusting normalization parameters based on input complexity. While the exact reference is not provided in the sources, the idea aligns with techniques like those described in \"CASAK-V\" which introduces dynamic mechanisms for attention and compression. For instance, dynamic sparse attention in CASAK-V adjusts the sparsity ratio based on the current context length, which could be extended to normalization layers.\n\n## Adaptive Attention Scaling\n\n- Adaptive attention scaling mechanisms, such as those described in the analysis, can be found in works like CASAK-V.

CASAK-V's adaptive KV-cache compression is a relevant example, where the compression strategy is adjusted based on token importance and attention patterns. This dynamic approach ensures that critical information is retained while less important information is compressed, thereby reducing memory usage.\n\n## Key Insights and Relevant Information\n\n### Dynamic and Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n- **CASAK-V**: This work introduces dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which are highly relevant to the researcher's goals. The dynamic adjustment of sparsity and compression policies based on context length and token importance can be adapted to both normalization and attention mechanisms.\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Compression\n\n- **Ultimate Compression Method**: This method involves tensor decomposition, binarization, and fine-tuning to achieve high compression ratios while maintaining model accuracy. While focused on general neural networks, the principles of tensor decomposition and adaptive rank selection could be applied to transformer models to enhance memory efficiency.\n\n### Robustness and Scalability\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization**: Techniques like Adaptive RMSNorm, which adjust normalization parameters based on input distributions, can enhance model robustness and performance. This aligns with the goal of improving model stability and adaptability to diverse inputs[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Mathematical Foundations**: Investigate the mathematical formulations behind dynamic normalization and adaptive attention scaling to understand their impact on model training and inference.\n- **Complexity Estimation**: Research methods for estimating input complexity to inform adaptive attention scaling decisions.\n- **Advanced Compression Algorithms**: Explore state-of-the-art compression algorithms that can be applied to selective memory compression within transformer models.\n- **Case Studies**: Analyze existing models that integrate dynamic normalization, adaptive attention, and selective compression to identify best practices and potential challenges.\n- **Performance Metrics**: Establish relevant performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated GAU designs and compare them with state-of-the-art models.\n\n## Most Useful References\n\n- **CASAK-V**: This work provides a comprehensive approach to dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which are directly relevant to the researcher's goals.\n- **Ultimate Compression Method**: This method offers insights into achieving high compression ratios while maintaining model accuracy, which can be adapted to transformer models.\n\nBy integrating these dynamic and adaptive mechanisms, the researcher can develop a novel LM block that enhances memory efficiency, computational scalability, and overall model adaptability, potentially outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Deep Point Cloud Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm in Transformers\"*\n\n*J. Choe, Byeongin Joung, Fran\u00e7ois Rameau, Jaesik Park, In-So Kweon*\n\n**TL;DR:** A deep point cloud reconstruction network consisting of a 3D sparse stacked-hourglass network as for the initial densification and denoising, and a refinement via transformers converting the discrete voxels into 3D points called amplified positional encoding is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Point cloud obtained from 3D scanning is often sparse, noisy, and irregular. To cope with these issues, recent studies have been separately conducted to densify, denoise, and complete inaccurate point cloud. In this paper, we advocate that jointly solving these tasks leads to significant improvement for point cloud reconstruction. To this end, we propose a deep point cloud reconstruction network consisting of two stages: 1) a 3D sparse stacked-hourglass network as for the initial densification and denoising, 2) a refinement via transformers converting the discrete voxels into 3D points. In particular, we further improve the performance of transformer by a newly proposed module called amplified positional encoding. This module has been designed to differently amplify the magnitude of positional encoding vectors based on the points' distances for adaptive refinements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance among the recent studies in the ScanNet, ICL-NUIM, and ShapeNetPart datasets. Moreover, we underline the ability of our network to generalize toward real-world and unmet scenes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1323  (*Influential: 184*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

Understanding and Overcoming the Challenges of Efficient Transformer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Yelysei Bondarenko, Markus Nagel, Tijmen Blankevoort*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel quantization scheme \u2013 per-embedding-group quantization, and shows that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures have become the de-facto standard models for a wide range of Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint and high latency are prohibitive for efficient deployment and inference on resource-limited devices. In this work, we explore quantization for transformers. We show that transformers have unique quantization challenges \u2013 namely, high dynamic activation ranges that are difficult to represent with a low bit fixed-point format. We establish that these activations contain structured outliers in the residual connections that encourage specific attention patterns, such as attending to the special separator token. To combat these challenges, we present three solutions based on post-training quantization and quantization-aware training, each with a different set of compromises for accuracy, model size, and ease of use. In particular, we introduce a novel quantization scheme \u2013 per-embedding-group quantization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the GLUE benchmark using BERT, establishing state-of-the-art results for post-training quantization. Finally, we show that transformer weights and embeddings can be quantized to ultra-low bit-widths, leading to significant memory savings with a minimum accuracy loss.

NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Yong Guo, Yin Zheng, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, P. Zhao, Junzhou Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7.

Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm in Transformers\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm in Transformers\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's\nattention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences.\nIn this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism\nthat approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions,\nyielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity.\nSpecifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence\ninto a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using\nthe second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention\nmechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input\nand an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention\noperation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We\nperform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks:\nlong-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language\nmodeling for large-scale pretraining.

Superiority of Softmax: Unveiling the Performance Edge Over Linear\n  Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yichuan Deng, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in numerous\nnatural language processing tasks. Among the pivotal components of the\ntransformer architecture, the attention mechanism plays a crucial role in\ncapturing token interactions within sequences through the utilization of\nsoftmax function.\n  Conversely, linear attention presents a more computationally efficient\nalternative by approximating the softmax operation with linear complexity.\nHowever, it exhibits substantial performance degradation when compared to the\ntraditional softmax attention mechanism.\n  In this paper, we bridge the gap in our theoretical understanding of the\nreasons behind the practical performance gap between softmax and linear\nattention. By conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of these two\nattention mechanisms, we shed light on the underlying reasons for why softmax\nattention outperforms linear attention in most scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18T03:17:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-18T03:17:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Full Stack Optimization of Transformer Inference: a Survey\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper, Thanakul Wattanawong, Minwoo Kang, Ruohan Yan, Hasan Genc, Grace Dinh, Qijing Huang, Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Amir Gholami*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in state-of-the-art DNN architecture design have been moving\ntoward Transformer models. These models achieve superior accuracy across a wide\nrange of applications. This trend has been consistent over the past several\nyears since Transformer models were originally introduced. However, the amount\nof compute and bandwidth required for inference of recent Transformer models is\ngrowing at a significant rate, and this has made their deployment in\nlatency-sensitive applications challenging. As such, there has been an\nincreased focus on making Transformer models more efficient, with methods that\nrange from changing the architecture design, all the way to developing\ndedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different\napproaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and\nprofiling of the bottlenecks in existing Transformer architectures and their\nsimilarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii)\nimplications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of\nnon-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well\nas linear operations, on hardware design; (iii) approaches for optimizing a\nfixed Transformer architecture; (iv) challenges in finding the right mapping\nand scheduling of operations for Transformer models; and (v) approaches for\noptimizing Transformer models by adapting the architecture using neural\narchitecture search. Finally, we perform a case study by applying the surveyed\noptimizations on Gemmini, the open-source, full-stack DNN accelerator\ngenerator, and we show how each of these approaches can yield improvements,\ncompared to previous benchmark results on Gemmini. Among other things, we find\nthat a full-stack co-design approach with the aforementioned methods can result\nin up to 88.7x speedup with a minimal performance degradation for Transformer\ninference.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27T18:18:13Z  (*Updated: 2023-02-27T18:18:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. New Approaches to Long Document Summarization: Fourier Transform Based\n  Attention in a Transformer Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Andrew Kiruluta, Andreas Lemos, Eric Lundy*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we extensively redesign the newly introduced method of token\nmixing using Fourier Transforms (FNET) to replace the computationally expensive\nself-attention mechanism in a full transformer implementation on a long\ndocument summarization task (> 512 tokens). As a baseline, we also carried out\nlong document summarization using established methods such as Longformer and\nBig Bird transformer models that are capable of processing over 8000 tokens and\nare currently the state of the art methods for these type of problems. The\noriginal FNET paper implemented this in an encoder only architecture while\nabstractive summarization requires both an encoder and a decoder. Since such a\npretrained transformer model does not currently exist in the public domain, we\ndecided to implement a full transformer based on this Fourier token mixing\napproach in an encoder/decoder architecture which we trained starting with\nGlove embeddings for the individual words in the corpus. We investigated a\nnumber of different extensions to the original FNET architecture and evaluated\nthem on their Rouge F1-score performance on a summarization task. All\nmodifications showed better performance on the summarization task than when\nusing the original FNET encoder in a transformer architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-25T18:03:41Z  (*Updated: 2021-11-25T18:03:41Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Edge-MoE: Memory-Efficient Multi-Task Vision Transformer Architecture with Task-level Sparsity via Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang, Zhiwen Fan, Hanxue Liang, Rishov Sarkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Computer vision researchers are embracing two promising paradigms: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-task Learning (MTL), which both show great performance but are computation-intensive, given the quadratic complexity of self-attention in ViT and the need to activate an entire large MTL model for one task. M$^3$ViT is the latest multi-task ViT model that introduces mixture-of-experts (MoE), where only a small portion of subnetworks (\"experts\") are sparsely and dynamically activated based on the current task. M$^3$ViT achieves better accuracy and over 80% computation reduction but leaves challenges for efficient deployment on FPGA. Our work, dubbed Edge-MoE, solves the challenges to introduce the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for multi-task ViT with a collection of architectural innovations, including (1) a novel reordering mechanism for self-attention, which requires only constant bandwidth regardless of the target parallelism; (2) a fast single-pass softmax approximation; (3) an accurate and low-cost GELU approximation; (4) a unified and flexible computing unit that is shared by almost all computational layers to maximally reduce resource usage; and (5) uniquely for M$^3$ViT, a novel patch reordering method to eliminate memory access overhead. Edge-MoE achieves 2.24x and 4.90x better energy efficiency comparing with GPU and CPU, respectively.

FNet: Mixing Tokens with Fourier Transforms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\"*\n\n*Santiago Ontanon, Ilya Eckstein, Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that \"mix\" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths, our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the \"efficient\" Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is particularly efficient at smaller model sizes; for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models outperform Transformer counterparts.\n\n**Proceeding:** naacl-2022-7\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that integrates adaptive normalization, efficient attention mechanisms, and memory-efficient architectures, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources:\n\n## Adaptive RMSNorm in Transformers\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization Techniques**: The concept of normalizing vectors to a unit norm, as seen in the normalized Transformer (nGPT) architecture, can be highly beneficial. nGPT normalizes all vectors involved in embeddings, MLPs, attention matrices, and hidden states to unit norm, which allows for faster convergence and enhanced model stability.\n\n- **RMSNorm**: This is a newer normalization technique that is gradually replacing LayerNorm in some architectures. RMSNorm offers improved performance in certain models and is simpler to implement. It calculates the variance of the input data and normalizes it accordingly, which can be more efficient than traditional LayerNorm.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Vector Quantization**: The Transformer-VQ approach computes softmax-based dense self-attention in linear time by leveraging vector quantized keys and a novel caching mechanism. This method reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, making it feasible to handle very long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Parallel Attention Mechanisms**: Models like ViT-22B implement parallel layers where attention and MLP blocks operate simultaneously, rather than sequentially. This approach reduces training time and can be adapted to enhance the efficiency of attention mechanisms in the GAU.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Selective Memory Compression**: Techniques like Selective Memory Compression (SMC) can be employed to compress less critical hidden states while retaining essential information. This approach ensures that memory usage remains low without compromising the model's performance[Analysis Note, Reference 2].\n\n- **On-Chip Learning and Near-Memory Processing**: The use of on-chip plasticity processors and near-memory processing can significantly reduce memory requirements and improve efficiency. This involves storing token caches locally and reusing representations as weight matrices, which can be integrated into the GAU design.\n\n## Key Insights and Integration\n\n- **Hyperspherical Parameter Optimization**: The nGPT architecture's use of hyperspherical parameter optimization can be integrated with adaptive RMSNorm to enhance convergence and stability. This involves normalizing all vectors to unit norm, which can interpret matrix-vector multiplications as dot products signifying cosine similarities.\n\n- **Orthogonal Optimizers**: The use of orthogonal optimizers like OrthoAdam can help reduce outlier activations in hidden states, which is crucial for maintaining stable and efficient training. This can be combined with adaptive normalization and linear attention mechanisms to ensure robust performance.\n\n- **Asynchronous Parallel Linear Operations**: Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations in models like ViT-22B can enhance device efficiency by minimizing the time waiting on incoming communication. This can be integrated into the GAU design to improve overall efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Mathematical Foundations of Adaptive RMSNorm**: Investigating the theoretical underpinnings of Adaptive RMSNorm will help in understanding its impact on gradient flow, convergence, and overall model stability. This can provide a solid foundation for integrating adaptive normalization into the GAU.\n\n- **Advanced Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Exploring variations of linear attention, such as Kernel-based and Low-Rank attention methods, can help identify the most effective approaches for integration into the GAU.\n\n- **Compression Algorithms**: Delving into state-of-the-art compression techniques, including tensor decomposition and quantization, can help tailor selective memory compression for the GAU.\n\nBy synthesizing these components, the researcher can design a GAU that leverages adaptive normalization, efficient attention mechanisms, and memory-efficient architectures to outperform existing state-of-the-art models in terms of scalability, performance, and memory usage.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In defense of parameter sharing for model-compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\"*\n\n*Aditya Desai, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range.\n\n**Abstract:** When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint. Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state-of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST's sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST's inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Focused Quantization for Sparse CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\"*\n\n*Yiren Zhao, Xitong Gao, Daniel Bates, R. Mullins, Chengzhong Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper attends to the statistical properties of sparse CNNs and presents focused quantization, a novel quantization strategy based on power-of-two values, which exploits the weight distributions after fine-grained pruning, significantly reducing model sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for a wide range of vision tasks, but the enormous amount of memory and compute resources required by CNNs poses a challenge in deploying them on constrained devices. Existing compression techniques, while excelling at reducing model sizes, struggle to be computationally friendly. In this paper, we attend to the statistical properties of sparse CNNs and present focused quantization, a novel quantization strategy based on power-of-two values, which exploits the weight distributions after fine-grained pruning. The proposed method dynamically discovers the most effective numerical representation for weights in layers with varying sparsities, significantly reducing model sizes. Multiplications in quantized CNNs are replaced with much cheaper bit-shift operations for efficient inference. Coupled with lossless encoding, we build a compression pipeline that provides CNNs with high compression ratios (CR), low computation cost and minimal loss in accuracies. In ResNet-50, we achieved a 18.08x CR with only 0.24% loss in top-5 accuracy, outperforming existing compression methods. We fully compress a ResNet-18 and found that it is not only higher in CR and top-5 accuracy, but also more hardware efficient as it requires fewer logic gates to implement when compared to other state-of-the-art quantization methods assuming the same throughput.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we analyze the redundancy present in encoded dense vectors and show that the default dimension of 768 is unnecessarily large. To improve space efficiency, we propose a simple unsupervised compression pipeline that consists of principal component analysis (PCA), product quantization, and hybrid search. We further investigate other supervised baselines and find surprisingly that unsupervised PCA outperforms them in some settings.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformer Architectures with Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy.

Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrated Adaptive RMSNorm and Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"Integrated Adaptive RMSNorm and Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

Our method combines the advantages of both\nlow-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank\napproximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while\npruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning\nenhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation\nprevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons.

SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight\n  Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\"*\n\n*Tim Dettmers, Ruslan Svirschevski, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Saleh Ashkboos, Alexander Borzunov, Torsten Hoefler, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to\nhigh-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via\nquantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited\ndevices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However,\nquantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high\naccuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range,\nwhich are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we\nintroduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format\nand quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless\ncompression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression\nlevels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier\nweights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them\nin higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and\nachieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for\nhighly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B\nparameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance\ndegradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer\nwithout any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding\nweights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime.\nSpecifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which\nyields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while\nenabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-05T17:53:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-06-05T17:53:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Mahoney, Yakun Sophia Shao, Amir Gholami*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in state-of-the-art DNN architecture design have been moving\ntoward Transformer models. These models achieve superior accuracy across a wide\nrange of applications. This trend has been consistent over the past several\nyears since Transformer models were originally introduced. However, the amount\nof compute and bandwidth required for inference of recent Transformer models is\ngrowing at a significant rate, and this has made their deployment in\nlatency-sensitive applications challenging. As such, there has been an\nincreased focus on making Transformer models more efficient, with methods that\nrange from changing the architecture design, all the way to developing\ndedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different\napproaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and\nprofiling of the bottlenecks in existing Transformer architectures and their\nsimilarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii)\nimplications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of\nnon-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well\nas linear operations, on hardware design; (iii) approaches for optimizing a\nfixed Transformer architecture; (iv) challenges in finding the right mapping\nand scheduling of operations for Transformer models; and (v) approaches for\noptimizing Transformer models by adapting the architecture using neural\narchitecture search.

Parameter-Efficient Tuning on Layer Normalization for Pre-trained\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformer Architectures with Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Wang Qi, Yu-Ping Ruan, Yuan Zuo, Taihao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Conventional fine-tuning encounters increasing difficulties given the size of\ncurrent Pre-trained Language Models, which makes parameter-efficient tuning\nbecome the focal point of frontier research. Previous methods in this field add\ntunable adapters into MHA or/and FFN of Transformer blocks to enable PLMs\nachieve transferability. However, as an important part of Transformer\narchitecture, the power of layer normalization for parameter-efficent tuning is\nignored. In this paper, we first propose LN-tuning, by tuning the gain and bias\nterm of Layer Normalization module with only 0.03\\% parameters, which is of\nhigh time-efficency and significantly superior to baselines which are less than\n0.1\\% tunable parameters. Further, we study the unified framework of combining\nLN-tuning with previous ones and we find that: (1) the unified framework of\ncombining prefix-tuning, the adapter-based method working on MHA, and LN-tuning\nachieves SOTA performance. (2) unified framework which tunes MHA and LayerNorm\nsimultaneously can get performance improvement but those which tune FFN and\nLayerNorm simultaneous will cause performance decrease. Ablation study\nvalidates LN-tuning is of no abundant parameters and gives a further\nunderstanding of it.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-16T05:31:49Z  (*Updated: 2022-12-09T14:53:21Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless Generative Inference of LLM\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\"*\n\n*Tuo Zhao, Tushar Krishna, Zaoxing Liu, Geonhwa Jeong, Souvik Kundu, Qingru Zhang, Hao Kang*\n\n**Abstract:** Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x.

FiTv2: Scalable and Improved Flexible Vision Transformer for Diffusion Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformer Architectures with Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*and Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Cai Zhou, Di Huang, Zeyu Lu, Zidong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** \\textit{Nature is infinitely resolution-free}. In the context of this reality, existing diffusion models, such as Diffusion Transformers, often face challenges when processing image resolutions outside of their trained domain. To address this limitation, we conceptualize images as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, rather than traditional methods that perceive images as fixed-resolution grids. This perspective enables a flexible training strategy that seamlessly accommodates various aspect ratios during both training and inference, thus promoting resolution generalization and eliminating biases introduced by image cropping. On this basis, we present the \\textbf{Flexible Vision Transformer} (FiT), a transformer architecture specifically designed for generating images with \\textit{unrestricted resolutions and aspect ratios}. We further upgrade the FiT to FiTv2 with several innovative designs, includingthe Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LoRA module, a rectified flow scheduler, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Enhanced by a meticulously adjusted network structure, FiTv2 exhibits $2\\times$ convergence speed of FiT. When incorporating advanced training-free extrapolation techniques, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in both resolution extrapolation and diverse resolution generation. Additionally, our exploration of the scalability of the FiTv2 model reveals that larger models exhibit better computational efficiency. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient post-training strategy to adapt a pre-trained model for the high-resolution generation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the exceptional performance of FiTv2 across a broad range of resolutions. We have released all the codes and models at \\url{https://github.com/whlzy/FiT} to promote the exploration of diffusion transformer models for arbitrary-resolution image generation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. Rethinking Remote Sensing Change Detection With A Mask View\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient Transformer Architectures with Adaptive Normalization\"*\n\n*Siyang Song, Wei zhang, Rongrong Lian, Zhenkai Wu, Xiaowen Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Remote sensing change detection aims to compare two or more images recorded for the same area but taken at different time stamps to quantitatively and qualitatively assess changes in geographical entities and environmental factors. Mainstream models usually built on pixel-by-pixel change detection paradigms, which cannot tolerate the diversity of changes due to complex scenes and variation in imaging conditions. To address this shortcoming, this paper rethinks the change detection with the mask view, and further proposes the corresponding: 1) meta-architecture CDMask and 2) instance network CDMaskFormer. Components of CDMask include Siamese backbone, change extractor, pixel decoder, transformer decoder and normalized detector, which ensures the proper functioning of the mask detection paradigm. Since the change query can be adaptively updated based on the bi-temporal feature content, the proposed CDMask can adapt to different latent data distributions, thus accurately identifying regions of interest changes in complex scenarios. Consequently, we further propose the instance network CDMaskFormer customized for the change detection task, which includes: (i) a Spatial-temporal convolutional attention-based instantiated change extractor to capture spatio-temporal context simultaneously with lightweight operations; and (ii) a scene-guided axial attention-instantiated transformer decoder to extract more spatial details. State-of-the-art performance of CDMaskFormer is achieved on five benchmark datasets with a satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

It is simpler and more efficient than LayerNorm, making it a good fit for integration with linear attention mechanisms. Reference 6 and the analysis note highlight the benefits of RMSNorm, including its re-scaling invariance and implicit learning rate adaptation.\n\n- **Linear Attention**: Mechanisms like those in Performers and Transformer-VQ reduce computational complexity to linear time, making them highly efficient for long sequences. These mechanisms can be combined with Adaptive RMSNorm to enhance stability and performance. References 4 and the analysis note discuss how Performers and Transformer-VQ achieve this efficiency without sacrificing performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\n\n- **Selective Memory Compression (SMC)**: This technique compresses less critical hidden states while retaining essential information, reducing memory consumption. Integrating SMC with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention can optimize both memory usage and computational efficiency. The analysis note and Reference 2 (though not directly cited, the concept is relevant) discuss the importance of selective compression[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Scaling (HAS)**: This method involves progressively reducing sequence length while increasing feature dimension, leading to significant efficiency gains. Combining HAS with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention can further optimize resource usage. Reference 8 in the analysis note mentions HAS as a beneficial technique for processing extensive textual data efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability Enhancements\n\n- **Transformer-VQ and Performers**: These models demonstrate how linear-time attention can be achieved without compromising performance. When combined with Adaptive RMSNorm, they can handle very long sequences efficiently. References 4 and the analysis note provide detailed insights into these models[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Context Parallelism**: Techniques like context parallelism, as described in Reference 5, can be used to partition model activations along the sequence dimension, enhancing scalability and efficiency. This can be particularly useful when integrating with linear attention and adaptive normalization.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Benchmarks\n\n- **Empirical Results**: Studies such as those on Transformer-VQ and Performers show that integrating adaptive normalization with linear attention and selective compression can achieve significant speedups and memory savings without sacrificing accuracy. The analysis note and References 3 and 4 provide empirical evidence of these benefits[Analysis Note].\n\n## Key Modifications and Techniques\n\n- **Omission of Biases and Asynchronous Parallel Linear Operations**: Techniques like those used in ViT-22B, such as omitting biases in QKV projections and using asynchronous parallel linear operations, can enhance resource utilization and device efficiency. These modifications can be considered when designing the integrated model.\n\n- **Mix-FFN and Linear Attention**: The use of Mix-FFN, which integrates depth-wise convolution to aggregate local information, can compensate for the weaker local information-capturing ability of linear attention. This is relevant when designing efficient transformer architectures with linear attention.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Advanced Compression Algorithms**: Investigating techniques like tensor decomposition, quantization, and pruning strategies that are compatible with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention mechanisms will be crucial. The analysis note outlines the need for exploring hybrid compression methods[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations**: Delving into the mathematical underpinnings of combining Adaptive RMSNorm with linear attention will help understand their joint impact on gradient flow, convergence rates, and model expressiveness. This is a key area for future research as highlighted in the analysis note[Analysis Note].\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates Adaptive RMSNorm with linear attention mechanisms and sparse memory compression techniques, leading to an efficient, scalable, and high-performance language model.\n",

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Understanding Adaptive, Multiscale Temporal Integration In Deep Speech Recognition Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm Integration\"*\n\n*Menoua Keshishian, Sam V. Norman-Haignere, N. Mesgarani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how a recently developed method for studying temporal integration in biological neural systems - the temporal context invariance (TCI) paradigm - can be used to understand temporal integration in DNNs, and suggests that deep speech recognition systems use a common motif to encode the hierarchical structure of speech.\n\n**Abstract:** Natural signals such as speech are hierarchically structured across many different timescales, spanning tens (e.g., phonemes) to hundreds (e.g., words) of milliseconds, each of which is highly variable and context-dependent. While deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at recognizing complex patterns from natural signals, relatively little is known about how DNNs flexibly integrate across multiple timescales. Here, we show how a recently developed method for studying temporal integration in biological neural systems - the temporal context invariance (TCI) paradigm - can be used to understand temporal integration in DNNs. The method is simple: we measure responses to a large number of stimulus segments presented in two different contexts and estimate the smallest segment duration needed to achieve a context invariant response. We applied our method to understand how the popular DeepSpeech2 model learns to integrate across time in speech. We find that nearly all of the model units, even in recurrent layers, have a compact integration window within which stimuli substantially alter the response and outside of which stimuli have little effect. We show that training causes these integration windows to shrink at early layers and expand at higher layers, creating a hierarchy of integration windows across the network. Moreover, by measuring integration windows for time-stretched/compressed speech, we reveal a transition point, midway through the trained network, where integration windows become yoked to the duration of stimulus structures (e.g., phonemes or words) rather than absolute time. Similar phenomena were observed in a purely recurrent and purely convolutional network although structure-yoked integration was more prominent in the recurrent network. These findings suggest that deep speech recognition systems use a common motif to encode the hierarchical structure of speech: integrating across short, time-yoked windows at early layers and long, structure-yoked windows at later layers. Our method provides a straightforward and general-purpose toolkit for understanding temporal integration in black-box machine learning models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Inspired by insights from cognitive science, our task-adaptive tokenizer samples variable segmentations from multiple outcomes, with sampling probabilities optimized based on task-specific data. We introduce a strategy for building a specialized vocabulary and introduce a vocabulary merging protocol that allows for the integration of task-specific tokens into the pre-trained model's tokenization step. Through extensive experiments on psychological question-answering tasks in both Chinese and English, we find that our task-adaptive tokenization approach brings a significant improvement in generation performance while using up to 60% fewer tokens. Preliminary experiments point to promising results when using our tokenization approach with very large language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Self-Adaptive Motion Tracking against On-body Displacement of Flexible Sensors\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm Integration\"*\n\n*Chengxu Zuo, Jiawei Fang, Shihui Guo, Yipeng Qin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel self-adaptive motion tracking network equipped with a light-weight learnable Affine Transformation layer whose parameters can be tuned to efficiently adapt to unknown displacements to address on-body displacement issue.\n\n**Abstract:** Flexible sensors are promising for ubiquitous sensing of human status due to their flexibility and easy integration as wearable systems. However, on-body displacement of sensors is inevitable since the device cannot be firmly worn at a fixed position across different sessions. This displacement issue causes complicated patterns and significant challenges to subsequent machine learning algorithms. Our work proposes a novel self-adaptive motion tracking network to address this challenge. Our network consists of three novel components: i) a light-weight learnable Affine Transformation layer whose parameters can be tuned to efficiently adapt to unknown displacements; ii) a Fourier-encoded LSTM network for better pattern identification; iii) a novel sequence discrepancy loss equipped with auxiliary regres-sors for unsupervised tuning of Affine Transformation parameters. Experimental results show that our method is robust across different on-body position configurations.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1323  (*Influential: 184*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7.

Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity.

Deep Compression of Pre-trained Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Naigang Wang, Chia-Chun Liu, Swagath Venkataramani, Sanchari Sen, Chia-Yu Chen, K. E. Maghraoui, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Le Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision are introduced and critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning are identified.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and have recently become competitive alternatives to Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in vision and speech tasks, respectively. Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm Integration\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive RMSNorm Integration\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using\nthe second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention\nmechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input\nand an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention\noperation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information.

To reduce the size and complexity of\nthese models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel\nmodel compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a\nlow-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both\nlow-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank\napproximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while\npruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning\nenhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation\nprevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons.

GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have become ubiquitous in natural language\nprocessing thanks to their large capacity, innate parallelism and high\nperformance. The contextualizing component of a Transformer block is the\n$\\textit{pairwise dot-product}$ attention that has a large $\\Omega(L^2)$ memory\nrequirement for length $L$ sequences, limiting its ability to process long\ndocuments. This has been the subject of substantial interest recently, where\nmultiple approximations were proposed to reduce the quadratic memory\nrequirement using sparse attention matrices. In this work, we propose to\naugment sparse Transformer blocks with a dense attention-based $\\textit{global\nmemory}$ of length $M$ ($\\ll L$) which provides an aggregate global view of the\nentire input sequence to each position.

Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: \"Linear Attention Mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 2.

MatrixVT: Efficient Multi-Camera to BEV Transformation for 3D Perception\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Xiangyu Zhang, Zeming Li, Zheng Ge, HongYu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes an efficient multi-camera to Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) view transformation method for 3D perception, dubbed MatrixVT. Existing view transformers either suffer from poor transformation efficiency or rely on device-specific operators, hindering the broad application of BEV models. In contrast, our method generates BEV features efficiently with only convolutions and matrix multiplications (MatMul). Specifically, we propose describing the BEV feature as the MatMul of image feature and a sparse Feature Transporting Matrix (FTM). A Prime Extraction module is then introduced to compress the dimension of image features and reduce FTM's sparsity. Moreover, we propose the Ring \\& Ray Decomposition to replace the FTM with two matrices and reformulate our pipeline to reduce calculation further. Compared to existing methods, MatrixVT enjoys a faster speed and less memory footprint while remaining deploy-friendly. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that our method is highly efficient but obtains results on par with the SOTA method in object detection and map segmentation tasks\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-19\n\n\n\n#### 4. GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless Generative Inference of LLM\n\n*From Search Query: \"Sparse Memory Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Tuo Zhao, Tushar Krishna, Zaoxing Liu, Geonhwa Jeong, Souvik Kundu, Qingru Zhang, Hao Kang*\n\n**Abstract:** Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoKang-Timmy/GEAR.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that integrates Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression techniques, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources:\n\n## Adaptive RMSNorm Integration\n\n- **Purpose and Effect**: Adaptive RMSNorm provides context-sensitive normalization, allowing the model to scale features dynamically based on the input\u2019s global context. This adaptability enhances the model\u2019s ability to generalize across diverse inputs and improves training stability.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: RMSNorm is computationally simpler and more efficient than LayerNorm, making it ideal for integration with linear attention mechanisms to reduce overall computational complexity.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Scalability**: Linear attention models, such as Performers and Transformer-VQ, reduce the quadratic complexity of standard attention to linear time, enabling the efficient handling of longer sequences. For example, the \"Hedgehog\" approach uses simple trainable MLPs to mimic softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity.\n- **Implementation**: Integrating linear attention with Adaptive RMSNorm requires careful alignment of normalization techniques. Studies show that such integration can maintain high performance metrics while reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Sparse Memory Compression Techniques\n\n- **Selective Compression**: Techniques like Selective Memory Compression, Loki, and SpQR focus on compressing less critical hidden states, reducing memory consumption without significant performance loss. For instance, SpQR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression by identifying and isolating outlier weights.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Combining low-rank and sparse approximations, as in LoSparse, can significantly compress model weights while maintaining performance. This approach is particularly effective when integrated with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention.\n\n## Key Insights and Integration Strategies\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Scaling (HAS)**: Implementing hierarchical strategies can optimize attention computations by progressively reducing sequence length while enhancing feature dimensions. This can be combined with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention for further efficiency gains[Analysis Note].\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining Adaptive RMSNorm with linear attention and selective compression requires a cohesive architectural design. Models like SLAB, which use simplified linear attention and progressive re-parameterized batch normalization, demonstrate successful integrations[Analysis Note].\n\n## Relevant References\n\n- **Adaptive RMSNorm**:\n  - \"Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\" by Zhang and Sennrich highlights the computational simplicity and re-scaling invariance of RMSNorm.\n  - The \"Liquid-Metal-Tinyllama-Test-1\" model integrates Adaptive RMSNorm within its decoder layer, showing improved generalization and stability.\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**:\n  - \"Rethinking Attention with Performers\" by Choromanski et al. introduces linear attention mechanisms that reduce computational complexity.\n  - \"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry\" by Zhang et al. provides a method to mimic softmax attention properties while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n- **Sparse Memory Compression Techniques**:\n  - \"SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression\" by Dettmers et al. demonstrates near-lossless compression techniques that can be integrated with other components.\n  - \"LoSparse: Structured Compression of Large Language Models based on Low-Rank and Sparse Approximation\" by Li et al. shows the effectiveness of combining low-rank and sparse approximations for memory-efficient transformers.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Mathematical Foundations and Theoretical Analysis**: Investigate the theoretical implications of integrating these components, including gradient flow, convergence rates, and model expressiveness.\n- **Advanced Compression Algorithms**: Explore state-of-the-art compression techniques compatible with Adaptive RMSNorm and linear attention to further enhance memory efficiency.\n- **Benchmarking and Performance Metrics**: Establish robust benchmarking standards to evaluate the effectiveness of the integrated GAU across diverse datasets and tasks.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Research hardware-specific optimizations to maximize efficiency gains on various platforms.\n- **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Incorporate concepts from related fields to inspire novel integration strategies.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a highly efficient and scalable GAU that leverages Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression techniques to outperform existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

Summary of Analysis:**\n\nIn this third research phase, I focused on synthesizing information from both internal and external sources to explore the integration of Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression techniques within transformer-based language models.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: Adaptive RMSNorm Sparse Memory Compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Being a convenient and straightforward model compression approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted in 2D vision tasks. However, applying it directly to 3D lidar-based tasks inevitably leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, we propose an effective PTQ method called LiDAR-PTQ, which is particularly curated for 3D lidar detection (both SPConv-based and SPConv-free). Our LiDAR-PTQ features three main components, \\textbf{(1)} a sparsity-based calibration method to determine the initialization of quantization parameters, \\textbf{(2)} a Task-guided Global Positive Loss (TGPL) to reduce the disparity between the final predictions before and after quantization, \\textbf{(3)} an adaptive rounding-to-nearest operation to minimize the layerwise reconstruction error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LiDAR-PTQ can achieve state-of-the-art quantization performance when applied to CenterPoint (both Pillar-based and Voxel-based). To our knowledge, for the very first time in lidar-based 3D detection tasks, the PTQ INT8 model's accuracy is almost the same as the FP32 model while enjoying $3\\times$ inference speedup. Moreover, our LiDAR-PTQ is cost-effective being $30\\times$ faster than the quantization-aware training method.

Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Sparse Memory Compression*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, integrating adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression is crucial.

Memformer: A Memory-Augmented Transformer for Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Qingyang Wu, Zhenzhong Lan, Kun Qian, Jing Gu, A.

However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement.

Nevertheless, the quadratic computation complexity can be costly. Some works try to address the limitations of selfattention, including Reformer, Sparse Transformer, Longformer, Linformer (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), etc. They successfully reduce the complexity of self-attention and thus enable processing longer sequences. However, most of them still require linear memory space complexity. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) re-introduces the concept of memory and recurrence. It caches each layer's hidden states of self-attention into a fixed-size queue and re-uses them in the later attention computation. However, the memory as raw hidden states cannot effectively compress highlevel information. Thus, Transformer-XL in practice needs a massive memory size to perform well, and spends huge computation in using its memory. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) improves upon Transformer-XL by further compressing its memories into fewer vectors via a compression network. However, as mentioned in the papers, both Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer discard the information from the distant past, which causes a theoretical maximum tempo-\nral range given the fixed memory size. Inspired by the previous external memory networks, we propose Memformer, which incorporates a fixed-size external dynamic memory combined with the recent Transformer architecture. Memformer interacts with its external dynamic memory through the memory reading and writing modules. Also, we introduce a forgetting mechanism to improve the effectiveness of memorizing new information. By utilizing recurrence and a fixedsize memory, our model has a theoretically infinite temporal range of memorization and implies a linear computation complexity and constant memory space complexity. As the traditional backpropagation through time (BPTT) has an unaffordable memory cost in our model, we introduce a new optimization scheme, memory replay backpropagation (MRBP), to significantly reduce the memory cost in training recurrent neural networks with large size of memory representations. We evaluate Memformer on the autoregressive image generation and language modeling task. Experimental results show that Memformer performs on par with Transformer and Transformer XL with large memory size, while being much more efficient in terms of computation speed and memory space consumption. We also conduct an analysis showing that Memformer can retain information for an extended period. ## 2 Related Work\n\nThis section introduces some recent research directions that aim to alleviate the quadratic cost of selfattention. Moreover, we analyze their assumptions and limitations under the autoregressive setting to provide a broader view of these models. ### 2.1 Sparse Attention\n\nOne influential direction is to replace the full selfattention with sparse attention patterns to speed up the computation. Child et al. (2019) proposed Sparse Transformer, using a block sparse attention pattern to reduce the computation complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Later, Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) further explored this direction and proposed an even more sparse attention pattern to reduce the cost to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. They introduced global tokens to encode the information from the entire sequence and kept the selfattention to the closest $k$ tokens and the global tokens to achieve linear complexity. Although linear sparse attention's theoretical soundness is proven for bidirectional encoders, it does not hold for the decoder. The main reason is that the global tokens cannot leak information to the future tokens in the autoregressive setting, where all the tokens can only see their previous tokens. Thus, linear sparse attention cannot guarantee a token to see its all past tokens. Only Sparse Transformer here with $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ complexity can theoretically cover all the past tokens for the sequence generation. ### 2.2 Linear Attention\n\nAnother direction is focusing on improving the softmax operation in the self-attention. Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ by projecting the entire sequence to a constant size of keys and values, but this method has not been applied to autoregressive decoding. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) used a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps to replace softmax. However, for Linear Transformer under the autoregressive setting, it needs to compute the cumulative summation to aggregate the history information. This assumption is too strong if the input sequence is long and the length is not fixed. After thousands of steps, the numerical values can become very large due to the summation, causing overflow and gradient instability. ### 2.3 Recurrence and Memory\n\nApplying recurrence and memory to Transformers is an orthogonal direction comparing to the efficient attention approaches. If the memory size is constant, recurrence enables the model to have constant memory complexity during inference. There are mainly two works exploring this direction. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) used relative positional encoding and consisted of a segmentlevel recurrence mechanism to encode beyond a fixed-length context. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) extended from Transformer-XL by further compressing the previous cached hidden states to achieve a longer context. However, using past hidden states as memory would cause a theoretical maximum temporal range of context, meaning that a token is not guaranteed to see all the past tokens. Thus, in practice, Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer need huge memory size to achieve good performance. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a5b0bfb29582fd0f4766g-03.jpg?height=915&width=717&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: Memformer overall architecture for the encoder (left) and decoder (right). Transformer encoder is responsible to interact with the memory. Sequence modeling is achieved by predicting the next segment conditioned to the current segment and memory. ### 2.3.1 Dynamic Memorization\n\nWithin the scope of memory networks, there are dynamic memorization techniques. Different from Transformer-XL which stores the token-level history representations as memory, dynamic memorization does not have a theoretical upper bound for the temporal range. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and Differential Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) are two early models that can control external memory resources to achieve long-lasting memory.\n```\n\n#### 2. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Polyhedron Attention Module: Learning Adaptive-order Interactions\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention*\n\n*Tan Zhu, Fei Dou, Xinyu Wang, Jin Lu, Jinbo Bi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) is proposed to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning feature interactions can be the key for multivariate predictive modeling. ReLU-activated neural networks create piecewise linear prediction models. Other nonlinear activation functions lead to models with only high-order feature interactions, thus lacking of interpretability. Recent methods incorporate candidate polynomial terms of fixed orders into deep learning, which is subject to the issue of combinatorial explosion, or learn the orders that are difficult to adapt to different regions of the feature space. We propose a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece. PAM is interpretable to identify important interactions in predicting a target. Theoretic analysis shows that PAM has stronger expression capability than ReLU-activated networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior classification performance of PAM on massive datasets of the click-through rate prediction and PAM can learn meaningful interaction effects in a medical problem.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

On the Role of Attention in Prompt-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention*\n\n*Samet Oymak, A. Rawat, M. Soltanolkotabi, Christos Thrampoulidis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores prompt-tuning for one-layer attention architectures and study contextual mixture-models where each input token belongs to a context-relevant or -irrelevant set and characterize the exact finite sample performance of prompt-attention which reveals the fundamental performance limits and the precise benefit of the context information.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt-tuning is an emerging strategy to adapt large language models (LLM) to downstream tasks by learning a (soft-)prompt parameter from data. Despite its success in LLMs, there is limited theoretical understanding of the power of prompt-tuning and the role of the attention mechanism in prompting. In this work, we explore prompt-tuning for one-layer attention architectures and study contextual mixture-models where each input token belongs to a context-relevant or -irrelevant set. We isolate the role of prompt-tuning through a self-contained prompt-attention model. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We show that softmax-prompt-attention is provably more expressive than softmax-self-attention and linear-prompt-attention under our contextual data model. (2) We analyze the initial trajectory of gradient descent and show that it learns the prompt and prediction head with near-optimal sample complexity and demonstrate how prompt can provably attend to sparse context-relevant tokens. (3) Assuming a known prompt but an unknown prediction head, we characterize the exact finite sample performance of prompt-attention which reveals the fundamental performance limits and the precise benefit of the context information. We also provide experiments that verify our theoretical insights on real datasets and demonstrate how prompt-tuning enables the model to attend to context-relevant information.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Neural ePDOs: Spatially Adaptive Equivariant Partial Differential Operator Based Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention*\n\n*Lingshen He, Yuxuan Chen, Zhengyang Shen, Yibo Yang, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel nonlinear PDOs scheme that is both spatially adaptive and translation equivariant, and efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP).\n\n**Abstract:** Endowing deep learning models with symmetry priors can lead to a considerable performance improvement. As an interesting bridge between physics and deep learning, the equivariant partial differential operators (PDOs) have drawn much researchers\u2019 attention recently. However, to ensure the PDOs translation equivariance, previous works have to require coefficient matrices to be constant and spatially shared for their linearity, which could lead to the sub-optimal feature learning at each position. In this work, we propose a novel nonlinear PDOs scheme that is both spatially adaptive and translation equivariant. The coefficient matrices are obtained by local features through a generator rather than spatially shared. Besides, we establish a new theory on incorporating more equivariance like rotations for such PDOs. Based on our theoretical results, we efficiently implement the generator with an equivariant multilayer perceptron (EMLP). As such equivariant PDOs are generated by neural networks, we call them Neural ePDOs. In experiments, we show that our method can significantly improve previous works with smaller model size in various datasets. Especially, we achieve the state-ofthe-art performance on the MNIST-rot dataset with only tenth of parameters of the previous best model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the integration of Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression, here are some key points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Adaptive RMSNorm\n- Adaptive RMSNorm involves dynamically adjusting normalization parameters based on the input distributions. This approach can enhance model robustness and stability across diverse tasks. For instance, the use of adaptive normalization techniques like RMSNorm has been discussed in the context of reducing memory footprint and improving stability in large language models. The paper on \"Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient Training\" touches on optimizing non-linear layers such as RMSNorm to reduce memory footprint, which is relevant to understanding the effectiveness of adaptive normalization.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- Linear attention mechanisms aim to reduce the computational complexity of attention from quadratic to linear. This is crucial for processing long sequences efficiently. The paper \"arXiv:2410.06577v1\" discusses various attention compression methods, including linear attention for semantic compression. It highlights how linear attention can simplify attention by reducing context length, which is essential for enhancing the local context understanding and reducing computational complexity.\n\n## Sparse Memory Compression\n- Sparse memory compression involves compressing less critical hidden states based on importance scores. This method is discussed in the context of token compression and head compression in the same paper \"arXiv:2410.06577v1\". It introduces sparsity into the attention mask, allowing it to focus on strategically chosen tokens, which can achieve O(1) complexity for per-token generation. This approach helps in evaluating the trade-offs between memory savings and potential loss of important information.\n\n## Integration Strategy\n- The integration of these components is key to the Raptor proposal. The paper \"arXiv:2410.06577v1\" provides insights into how different attention compression methods can be combined to enhance memory capacity and reduce complexity. It discusses the use of sparse attention, linear attention, and sharing-based attention, which can be synergistically combined to achieve optimal performance and memory efficiency.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Designs\n- Comparing the Raptor design with existing designs, such as \"CompressiveAdaptiveGPT,\" is essential. While the specific details of \"CompressiveAdaptiveGPT\" are not provided in the sources, the general approach of integrating adaptive normalization, linear attention, and sparse memory compression can be compared with other state-of-the-art models that employ similar techniques. For example, the COAT framework discussed in \"Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient Training\" offers a novel approach to reducing memory footprint, which can be a benchmark for evaluating the Raptor design's novelty and potential advantages.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis and Literature Review\n- Conducting a thorough literature review on these components will help in understanding their individual and combined effectiveness. Theoretical analysis of the proposed mathematical formulations and integration strategies is crucial. The paper \"arXiv:2410.06577v1\" provides a detailed theoretical analysis of attention compression methods, which can serve as a foundation for analyzing the Raptor proposal's mathematical soundness.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researchers can gather comprehensive insights into how Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression can be integrated to enhance the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of autoregressive language models.\n",

Evaluating the trade-offs between memory savings and potential loss of important information is necessary.\n\n4. **Integration Strategy**: The proposal aims to synergistically combine these components. Investigating how well these components integrate and whether they introduce any new challenges or limitations is essential.\n\n5. **Comparison with Existing Designs**: The proposal should be compared with existing designs, including its sibling \"CompressiveAdaptiveGPT,\" to determine its novelty and potential advantages.\n\n### Plan for Investigations\n- **Literature Review**: Conduct a literature review on Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression to gather insights into their individual and combined effectiveness.\n- **Comparison with Existing Designs**: Compare the Raptor design with similar proposals, especially its sibling \"CompressiveAdaptiveGPT,\" to assess its novelty and potential improvements.\n- **Theoretical Analysis**: Analyze the theoretical soundness of the proposed mathematical formulations and integration strategies.\n\n### High-Level External Search Query\n- **Keywords**: \"Adaptive RMSNorm Linear Attention Sparse Memory Compression\"\n\n### Detailed Internal Search Query\n- **Query**: \"Integration of Adaptive RMSNorm, Linear Attention, and Sparse Memory Compression in Transformer Models\"\n\n### Novelty Check\nThe proposal appears novel in its attempt to integrate these three specific components into a cohesive GAU design. However, it shares similarities with the sibling design \"CompressiveAdaptiveGPT,\" which also focuses on compression and adaptive scaling.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: Adaptive RMSNorm Sparse Memory Compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory, it has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism. The memory is analytically tractable, which enables optimal on-line compression via a Bayesian update-rule. We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets.

Being a convenient and straightforward model compression approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has been widely adopted in 2D vision tasks. However, applying it directly to 3D lidar-based tasks inevitably leads to performance degradation. As a remedy, we propose an effective PTQ method called LiDAR-PTQ, which is particularly curated for 3D lidar detection (both SPConv-based and SPConv-free). Our LiDAR-PTQ features three main components, \\textbf{(1)} a sparsity-based calibration method to determine the initialization of quantization parameters, \\textbf{(2)} a Task-guided Global Positive Loss (TGPL) to reduce the disparity between the final predictions before and after quantization, \\textbf{(3)} an adaptive rounding-to-nearest operation to minimize the layerwise reconstruction error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LiDAR-PTQ can achieve state-of-the-art quantization performance when applied to CenterPoint (both Pillar-based and Voxel-based). To our knowledge, for the very first time in lidar-based 3D detection tasks, the PTQ INT8 model's accuracy is almost the same as the FP32 model while enjoying $3\\times$ inference speedup.

Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive RMSNorm Sparse Memory Compression*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, integrating adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression is crucial. Here are some key insights and references that can help achieve this goal:\n\n## Adaptive RMSNorm\n- Adaptive normalization techniques, such as RMSNorm, can enhance the robustness and stability of language models. RMSNorm is particularly useful because it adapts to the input data, which can help in handling varying sequence lengths and contexts. For example, the paper on \"Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient Training\" mentions the use of RMSNorm and its variants, highlighting the importance of optimizing normalization layers to reduce memory footprint.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- Linear attention mechanisms significantly reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, making them more efficient for processing long sequences. Models like Luna and TransNormerLLM have demonstrated competitive performance using linear attention. Luna, for instance, approximates softmax attention with linear time and space complexity, capturing adequate contextual information efficiently.\n\n## Sparse Memory Compression\n- Techniques such as sparse attention and dynamic context pruning are essential for effective memory management. Sparse attention methods, like those described in the paper on attention compression methods, sparsify the attention mask to focus on strategically chosen tokens, achieving O(1) complexity for per-token generation. This approach enhances local context understanding and reduces memory requirements.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n- Combining these components requires careful consideration of integration challenges. Here are some strategies:\n  - **Dynamic Context Pruning**: This method dynamically prunes contextual information to reduce memory and computational requirements.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** SEA is proposed: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask, which estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. In defense of parameter sharing for model-compression\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention*\n\n*Aditya Desai, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range.\n\n**Abstract:** When considering a model architecture, there are several ways to reduce its memory footprint. Historically, popular approaches included selecting smaller architectures and creating sparse networks through pruning. More recently, randomized parameter-sharing (RPS) methods have gained traction for model compression at start of training. In this paper, we comprehensively assess the trade-off between memory and accuracy across RPS, pruning techniques, and building smaller models. Our findings demonstrate that RPS, which is both data and model-agnostic, consistently outperforms/matches smaller models and all moderately informed pruning strategies, such as MAG, SNIP, SYNFLOW, and GRASP, across the entire compression range. This advantage becomes particularly pronounced in higher compression scenarios. Notably, even when compared to highly informed pruning techniques like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), RPS exhibits superior performance in high compression settings. This points out inherent capacity advantage that RPS enjoys over sparse models. Theoretically, we establish RPS as a superior technique in terms of memory-efficient representation when compared to pruning for linear models. This paper argues in favor of paradigm shift towards RPS based models. During our rigorous evaluation of RPS, we identified issues in the state-of-the-art RPS technique ROAST, specifically regarding stability (ROAST's sensitivity to initialization hyperparameters, often leading to divergence) and Pareto-continuity (ROAST's inability to recover the accuracy of the original model at zero compression). We provably address both of these issues. We refer to the modified RPS, which incorporates our improvements, as STABLE-RPS.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neural Image Compression via Non-Local Attention Optimization and Improved Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse Memory Compression Linear Attention*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yao Wang, Xun Cao, Haojie Liu, Tong Chen, Qiu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel Non-Local Attention optmization and Improved Context modeling-based image compression (NLAIC) algorithm, which is built on top of the deep nerual network (DNN)-based variational auto-encoder (VAE) structure. Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, integrating Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression is crucial.

**Trade-off:** Dynamic compression and adaptive normalization may introduce additional computational steps.\n  - **Mitigation:** Optimize these operations using parallel computing and efficient data structures to minimize overhead.\n\n- **Model Stability vs. Adaptability:**\n  - **Trade-off:** Highly adaptive mechanisms can lead to instability during training.\n  - **Mitigation:** Incorporate regularization techniques and careful hyperparameter tuning to maintain stability while leveraging adaptability.\n\n- **Compression Accuracy vs. Memory Savings:**\n  - **Trade-off:** Aggressive compression may lead to loss of important information.\n  - **Mitigation:** Employ selective compression based on importance scores to balance memory savings with information retention.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Architectural Overview\n\n**Raptor** is composed of the following integrated components:\n\n1. **Adaptive RMSNorm Layer:**\n   - Applies dynamic normalization based on input complexities, scaling features adaptively to enhance model stability and performance.\n\n2. **Linear Attention Mechanism:**\n   - Utilizes a kernel-based linear attention approach to maintain scalability and efficiency, reducing the traditional quadratic complexity.\n\n3. **Sparse Memory Compression Module:**\n   - Compresses less critical hidden states based on importance scores, optimizing memory usage without sacrificing essential information.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Adaptive RMSNorm:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{AdaptiveRMSNorm}(x) = \\gamma(x) \\cdot \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{\\text{mean}(x^2) + \\epsilon}}\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\gamma(x)\\) is dynamically generated based on the input context.\n\n2. **Linear Attention Mechanism:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\phi(Q) (\\phi(K)^T V)\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\phi(Q)\\) and \\(\\phi(K)\\) are feature mappings that ensure linear scalability.\n\n3. **Sparse Memory Compression:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{CompressedCache} = \\text{Compress}(\\text{Cache}, \\text{ImportanceScores})\n   \\]\n   Where \\(\\text{ImportanceScores}\\) are derived from the significance of hidden states in the current context.\n\n### Integration Strategy\n\n- **Sequential Integration:**\n  1. **Normalize:** Apply Adaptive RMSNorm to the input embeddings.\n  2. **Attention:** Compute linear attention using the transformed embeddings.\n  3. **Compress:** Update and compress the KV-cache based on importance scores.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Scaling (HAS):**\n  - Implement a multi-tiered attention mechanism where initial layers focus on local contexts with high precision, and deeper layers integrate broader contexts using compressed representations.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-Code for Raptor

transformer-based language models by integrating Adaptive RMSNorm, linear attention mechanisms, and sparse memory compression techniques within the Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU). This integrated architecture achieves significant reductions in computational and memory overheads while maintaining, and potentially enhancing, model performance across diverse tasks. By dynamically adapting normalization parameters, employing linearized attention computations, and selectively compressing memory states, Raptor addresses the core challenges of scaling large language models to handle longer sequences and larger datasets effectively. This design not only optimizes resource utilization but also ensures model adaptability and stability, positioning Raptor as a superior alternative to existing state-of-the-art GAU architectures.\n\n## References\n\n1.
