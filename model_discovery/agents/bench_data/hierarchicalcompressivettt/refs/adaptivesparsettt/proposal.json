Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n#### 2. Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*M. Zaheer, Guru Guruganesh, Kumar Avinava Dubey, J.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/94 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nWe provide implementation details in App. D. ## 3 Theoretical Results about Sparse Attention Mechanism\n\nIn this section, we will show that that sparse attention mechanisms are as powerful and expressive as full-attention mechanisms in two respects.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/41 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nHowever, these static methods often prove suboptimal in various scenarios [66, 2]. Alternatively, sparse patterns can be learned in a data-driven manner. For example, Reformer [39] employs locality-sensitive hashing for token clustering and do attention within a cluster, while Routing Transformers [61], Cluster-Former [74] and Clustered Attention [73] use K-Means clustering on tokens. Besides, Sparse Sinkhorn Attention [68] establishes sparsity by sorting blocks of inputs. Despite achieving sub-quadratic complexity, these methods still remain above linear complexity and face challenges when handling extremely long sequences or failing to offer constant memory cost during inference. A recent approach by Anagnostidis et al. [2] introduces a learnable, irreversible key-value pair pruning for inference-time memory efficiency with the concept of relaxing pruning actions to accumulated gating. However, this method still suffers from quadratic complexity during training, hindering its ability to expedite the training process. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient sparse attention mechanism with learnable patterns, addressing all the aforementioned challenges. ## 3 SparseK Attention\n\n### 3.1 Background\n\nSelf-Attention Given a sequence of vectors $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ where $n$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the hidden dimension, an attention head first projects $\\boldsymbol{X}$ into query, key and value vectors with $\\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times p}$ where $p=\\frac{d}{h}$ and $h$ is the number of attention heads:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Q}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q} \\quad \\boldsymbol{K}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K} \\quad \\boldsymbol{V}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{V}\n$$\n\nIn the decoder-only architecture [72], a causal attention mask $\\boldsymbol{M}$ guarantees each query $q_{i}$ only attends to positions $\\leq i$. Consequently, the output $\\boldsymbol{O}$ of single-head dot-product attention is defined as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{K}^{\\top} \\quad \\boldsymbol{P}=\\operatorname{SoftMAx}(\\boldsymbol{S}+\\boldsymbol{M}) \\quad \\boldsymbol{O}=\\boldsymbol{P} \\boldsymbol{V}\n$$\n\nThe multi-head self-attention concatenates the outputs of multiple heads (indexed by subscripts) and applies a linear projection with $\\boldsymbol{W}_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{MHA}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\text { Concatenate }\\left(\\boldsymbol{O}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{O}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{O}_{h}\\right) \\boldsymbol{W}_{O}\n$$\n\nThe quadratic complexity of self-attention is contributed by the quadratically sized attention weight $\\boldsymbol{S}$. Inspired by Ainslie et al. [1], we propose to select a constant number of key-value pairs for each query in an irreversible way (defined formally in the following subsections 3.2 and 3.3), leading to linear training complexity and a constant inference-time memory cost. For simplicity, here we omit the RoPE position embedding [64] and focus on single-head attention to illustrate our methodology. The multi-head case is briefly discussed in Appendix C.7. SparseMax operator There are many popular technical choices that relax ArgMAX operation, such as SoftMax and SparseMax [46]. Especially, SparseMax uses the Euclidean projection onto the probabilistic simplex and tends to yield sparse solutions:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SPARSEMAX}(\\boldsymbol{z}):=\\underset{\\boldsymbol{p} \\in \\triangle^{m-1}}{\\arg \\min }\\|\\boldsymbol{p}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\triangle^{m-1}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\mid \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{p}=1, \\boldsymbol{p} \\geq 0\\right\\}$.

COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods and can be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training and lower extra storage cost than the existing works.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Long-range Sequence Modeling with Predictable Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Yimeng Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Mei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling, which remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been shown to be an effective approach for capturing global context dependencies in sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic complexity in time and memory usage. Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

Dynamic Slimmable Network\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Xiaojun Chang, Zhihui Li, Xiaodan Liang, Bing Wang, Guangrun Wang, Changlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Current dynamic networks and dynamic pruning methods have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity. However, dynamic sparse patterns on convolutional filters fail to achieve actual acceleration in real-world implementation, due to the extra burden of indexing, weight-copying, or zero-masking. Here, we explore a dynamic network slimming regime, named Dynamic Slimmable Network (DS-Net), which aims to achieve good hardware-efficiency via dynamically adjusting filter numbers of networks at test time with respect to different inputs, while keeping filters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden. Our DS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by the proposed double-headed dynamic gate that comprises an attention head and a slimming head to predictively adjust network width with negligible extra computation cost. To ensure generality of each candidate architecture and the fairness of gate, we propose a disentangled two-stage training scheme inspired by one-shot NAS. In the first stage, a novel training technique for weight-sharing networks named In-place Ensemble Bootstrapping is proposed to improve the supernet training efficacy. In the second stage, Sandwich Gate Sparsification is proposed to assist the gate training by identifying easy and hard samples in an online way. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DS-Net consistently outperforms its static counterparts as well as state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 5.9%). Typically, DS-Net achieves 2-4x computation reduction and 1.62x real-world acceleration over ResNet-50 and MobileNet with minimal accuracy drops on ImageNet.

Att2CPC: Attention-Guided Lossy Attribute Compression of Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Manoranjan Paul, Pan Gao, Kang You, Kai Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** With the great progress of 3D sensing and acquisition technology, the volume of point cloud data has grown dramatically, which urges the development of efficient point cloud compression methods. In this paper, we focus on the task of learned lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC). We propose an efficient attention-based method for lossy compression of point cloud attributes leveraging on an autoencoder architecture. Specifically, at the encoding side, we conduct multiple downsampling to best exploit the local attribute patterns, in which effective External Cross Attention (ECA) is devised to hierarchically aggregate features by intergrating attributes and geometry contexts. At the decoding side, the attributes of the point cloud are progressively reconstructed based on the multi-scale representation and the zero-padding upsampling tactic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce attention mechanism to point-based lossy PCAC task. We verify the compression efficiency of our model on various sequences, including human body frames, sparse objects, and large-scale point cloud scenes. Experiments show that our method achieves an average improvement of 1.15 dB and 2.13 dB in BD-PSNR of Y channel and YUV channel, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art point-based method Deep-PCAC.

SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns efficient state compression*\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of \"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on sparse attention mechanisms, efficient state compression, and integration with test-time training, here are some key insights and approaches from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n### Different Approaches to Sparse Attention Implementation\n\n1. **SeerAttention**:\n   This mechanism introduces a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in an attention map, deeming the rest sparse. This approach balances accuracy and speedup, particularly effective in post-training and long-context fine-tuning scenarios. It achieves a high sparsity ratio with minimal perplexity loss and significant speedup over traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n2. **HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention Acceleration**:\n   This method leverages the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms using a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure to rapidly identify non-zero or \"massively activated\" entries in the attention matrix. This approach reduces the running time complexity significantly, making it more efficient for long-context tasks.\n\n3. **Sparse Self-Attention Fine-tuning (SSAF)**:\n   This model integrates sparsity into the self-attention mechanism by replacing the softmax function with a controllable sparse transformation. This enables learning a structurally sparse attention distribution, leading to more interpretable representations and improved performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and question answering.\n\n### Methods for Efficient State Compression While Preserving Information\n\n1. **Adaptive Compression Techniques**:\n   Efficient state management for long sequences can be achieved through adaptive compression techniques. For instance, using hierarchical memory structures or dynamic compression methods that balance the trade-off between memory usage and information preservation. This is crucial for handling long sequences without losing context[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Optimized Storage Systems**:\n   Tools like UltiHash\u2019s byte-level deduplication and high-throughput storage systems can optimize the storage of large text corpora, reducing storage redundancy and ensuring rapid data access. This is essential for efficient training and inference of large language models.\n\n### Integration of Sparse Patterns with Test-Time Training\n\n1. **Combining Sparse Attention with FastTTTLinear**:\n   Integrating sparse attention mechanisms like SeerAttention or HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention with test-time training approaches like FastTTTLinear can enhance the model's adaptability and efficiency. This combination can improve the model's ability to adapt to new contexts while maintaining computational efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Differential Transformer**:\n   The Differential Transformer, which uses a differential attention mechanism to cancel out noise and amplify relevant attention, can be integrated with sparse attention patterns. This can further improve the model's ability to focus on pertinent context information, especially in long-context scenarios, and can be optimized for test-time training.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**:\n  Using hybrid architectures that combine different attention mechanisms (e.g., linear attention, sparse attention) and specialized layers can provide a balanced approach between efficiency and expressiveness. This is supported by the mechanistic design and scaling of hybrid architectures, which suggests that performance on curated synthetic tasks can predict scaling behavior[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Long-Context Handling**:\n  Models like the Differential Transformer and those using HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention are designed to handle long-context tasks more effectively. These models can mitigate issues like the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon and improve key information retrieval and in-context learning.\n\nBy incorporating these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and effective in handling complex sequences and long contexts, while also enhancing their adaptability through test-time training.\n",

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/68 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nWe discuss three advantages in detail below. Efficiency The most straightforward advantage is efficiency. By compressing the same text into a shorter token sequence, the model can process more text for the same computational cost. In particular, a model trained over $C \\times$ compressed text will see $C \\times$ more text during training compared to a model trained over raw text, given an equal compute budget. Increasing the amount of data seen in pretraining is often an effective means of improving performance (Kaplan et al., 2020 Hoffmann et al. 2022). Processing text more efficiently also confers benefits at inference time, reducing the serving cost for handling a request of a given prompt and continuation length. In addition to reducing the raw compute needed for inference, compression can also improve inference latency, since generating better-compressed output requires fewer sequential autoregressive steps. Longer Context A second advantage is that working with compressed text allows modeling longer contextual dependencies. In vanilla transformer-based models, computation for the self-attention layer scales quadratically with the sequence length, $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. This has limited the sequence lengths used by such models\nin practical settings to $\\sim 10 \\mathrm{k}$ tokens $5^{5}$ If, via compression, each token represents (on average) $C$ bytes of raw text, then the resulting LLM can model dependencies across $C \\times$ longer distances compared to a raw text model operating over the same token sequence length. While the benefits of modeling longer context (beyond $\\sim 1,000$ bytes) are modest when viewed merely as perplexity gains (Press et al. 2022), the ability to condition on long context is critical for many applications, such as retrieving content from a document, or answering a coding question provided documentation. Distribution of Compute A third potential advantage of training over compressed text is that information will be spread more uniformly across the sequence. By the nature of compression, a text span that is relatively predictable (e.g., a boilerplate notice) will be more compressible than a span with high perplexity (e.g., a unique product serial number). When an LLM is trained over well-compressed text, each token will represent roughly an equal amount of information. Since the LLM allocates equal compute to each token, this amounts to allocating more compute for \"harder\" text spans. This adaptivity is similar in spirit to \"Adaptive Computation Time\" (ACT) Graves, 2017), which learns to allocate additional compute at some sequence positions in an end-to-end manner, but with the advantage that in our case the computation remains \"dense\"-identical operations are applied at each position ${ }^{6}$\n\n### 2.2 Challenges of Training over Compressed Text\n\nLearnability It is not at all obvious what types of compression are \"transparent\" enough to be learnable through a standard LLM training process.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/51 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nThis compression has two consequences. On one hand, mapping an input token $x_{t}$ to output token $z_{t}$ is efficient, because both the update rule and output rule take constant time per token. On the other hand, the performance of RNN layers in long context is limited by the expressive power of its hidden state $s_{t}$.

Top: A generic sequence modeling layer expressed as a hidden state that transitions according to an update rule. All sequence modeling layers can be viewed as different instantiations of three components in this figure: the initial state, update rule and output rule. Bottom: Examples of sequence modeling layers and their instantiations of the three components. The naive TTT layer was shown in Figure 1. Self-attention has a hidden state growing with context, therefore growing cost per token. Both the naive RNN and TTT layer compress the growing context into a hidden state of fixed size, therefore their cost per token stays constant. Self-attention can also be viewed from the perspective above, except that its hidden state, commonly known as the Key-Value (KV) cache, is a list that grows linearly with $t$. Its update rule simply appends the current KV tuple to this list, and the output rule scans over all tuples up to $t$ to form the attention matrix. The hidden state explicitly stores all historic context without compression, making self-attention more expressive than RNN layers for long context. However, scanning this linearly growing hidden state also takes linearly growing time per token. To remain both efficient and expressive in long context, we need a better compression heuristic. Specifically, we need to compress thousands or potentially millions of tokens into a hidden state that can effectively capture their underlying structures and relationships. This might sound like a tall order, but all of us are actually already familiar with such a heuristic. ### 2.1 TTT as updating a hidden state\n\nThe process of parametric learning can be viewed as compressing a massive training set into the weights of a model. Specifically, we know that models trained with self-supervision can capture the underlying structures and relationships behind their training data [48] - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. LLMs themselves are great examples. Trained with the self-supervised task of next-token prediction, their weights can be viewed as a compressed form of storage for existing knowledge on the internet. By querying LLMs, we can extract knowledge from their weights. More importantly, LLMs often exhibit a deep understanding of the semantic connections among existing knowledge to express new pieces of reasoning [1]. Our key idea is to use self-supervised learning to compress the historic context $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$ into a hidden state $s_{t}$, by making the context an unlabeled dataset and the state a model. Concretely, the hidden state $s_{t}$ is now equivalent to $W_{t}$, the weights of a model $f$, which can be a linear model, a\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-05.jpg?height=354&width=1491&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 5.

Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/83 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nE.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state compression techniques test-time training\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Density-Softmax: Efficient Test-time Model for Uncertainty Estimation and Robustness under Distribution Shifts\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques test-time training*\n\n*H.

However, they suffer from a large model size and high latency at test-time, which limits the scalability needed for low-resource devices and real-time applications. To resolve these computational issues, we propose Density-Softmax, a sampling-free deterministic framework via combining a density function built on a Lipschitz-constrained feature extractor with the softmax layer. Theoretically, we show that our model is the solution of minimax uncertainty risk and is distance-aware on feature space, thus reducing the over-confidence of the standard softmax under distribution shifts. Empirically, our method enjoys competitive results with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of uncertainty and robustness, while having a lower number of model parameters and a lower latency at test-time.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques test-time training*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. 1-bit Adam: Communication Efficient Large-Scale Training with Adam's Convergence Speed\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques test-time training*\n\n*Hanlin Tang, Shaoduo Gan, A.

From a system standpoint, communication has become a major bottleneck, especially on commodity systems with standard TCP interconnects that offer limited network bandwidth. Communication compression is an important technique to reduce training time on such systems. One of the most effective methods is error-compensated compression, which offers robust convergence speed even under 1-bit compression. However, state-of-the-art error compensation techniques only work with basic optimizers like SGD and momentum SGD, which are linearly dependent on the gradients. They do not work with non-linear gradient-based optimizers like Adam, which offer state-of-the-art convergence efficiency and accuracy for models like BERT. In this paper, we propose 1-bit Adam that reduces the communication volume by up to $5\\times$, offers much better scalability, and provides the same convergence speed as uncompressed Adam. Our key finding is that Adam's variance (non-linear term) becomes stable (after a warmup phase) and can be used as a fixed precondition for the rest of the training (compression phase). Experiments on up to 256 GPUs show that 1-bit Adam enables up to $3.3\\times$ higher throughput for BERT-Large pre-training and up to $2.9\\times$ higher throughput for SQuAD fine-tuning.

Determining the robustness of the best possible classifier under a given threat model for a given data distribution and comparing it to that achieved by state-of-the-art training methods is thus an important diagnostic tool. In this paper, we find achievable information-theoretic lower bounds on loss in the presence of a test-time attacker for multi-class classifiers on any discrete dataset. We provide a general framework for finding the optimal 0-1 loss that revolves around the construction of a conflict hypergraph from the data and adversarial constraints. We further define other variants of the attacker-classifier game that determine the range of the optimal loss more efficiently than the full-fledged hypergraph construction. Our evaluation shows, for the first time, an analysis of the gap to optimal robustness for classifiers in the multi-class setting on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Winning the Lottery Ahead of Time: Efficient Early Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques test-time training*\n\n*John Rachwan, Daniel Zugner, Bertrand Charpentier, Simon Geisler, Morgane Ayle, Stephan Gunnemann*\n\n**TL;DR:** Early Compression via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP) is proposed, which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge, and can be applied in a structured manner addressing challenge.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning, the task of sparsifying deep neural networks, received increasing attention recently. Although state-of-the-art pruning methods extract highly sparse models, they neglect two main challenges: (1) the process of finding these sparse models is often very expensive; (2) unstructured pruning does not provide benefits in terms of GPU memory, training time, or carbon emissions. We propose Early Compression via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP), which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge (1), and can be applied in a structured manner addressing challenge (2). This enables us to train sparse networks on commodity GPUs whose dense versions would be too large, thereby saving costs and reducing hardware requirements. We empirically show that EarlyCroP outperforms a rich set of baselines for many tasks (incl. classification, regression) and domains (incl. computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcment learning). EarlyCroP leads to accuracy comparable to dense training while outperforming pruning baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Slimmable Network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression techniques test-time training*\n\n*Xiaojun Chang, Zhihui Li, Xiaodan Liang, Bing Wang, Guangrun Wang, Changlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Current dynamic networks and dynamic pruning methods have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity. However, dynamic sparse patterns on convolutional filters fail to achieve actual acceleration in real-world implementation, due to the extra burden of indexing, weight-copying, or zero-masking. Here, we explore a dynamic network slimming regime, named Dynamic Slimmable Network (DS-Net), which aims to achieve good hardware-efficiency via dynamically adjusting filter numbers of networks at test time with respect to different inputs, while keeping filters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden. Our DS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by the proposed double-headed dynamic gate that comprises an attention head and a slimming head to predictively adjust network width with negligible extra computation cost. To ensure generality of each candidate architecture and the fairness of gate, we propose a disentangled two-stage training scheme inspired by one-shot NAS. In the first stage, a novel training technique for weight-sharing networks named In-place Ensemble Bootstrapping is proposed to improve the supernet training efficacy. In the second stage, Sandwich Gate Sparsification is proposed to assist the gate training by identifying easy and hard samples in an online way. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DS-Net consistently outperforms its static counterparts as well as state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 5.9%). Typically, DS-Net achieves 2-4x computation reduction and 1.62x real-world acceleration over ResNet-50 and MobileNet with minimal accuracy drops on ImageNet.

For instance, the COAT framework introduces dynamic range expansion and mixed-granularity activation quantization to reduce the memory footprint during FP8 training. This approach aligns optimizer state distributions with the FP8 representation range, reducing quantization error and achieving nearly lossless performance.\n\n### Activation Checkpointing and Optimizer State Offloading\nTechniques like activation checkpointing and offloading optimizer states to CPU memory can also reduce GPU memory usage. Activation checkpointing involves recalculating intermediate states during the backward pass instead of storing them, trading runtime for memory savings. Offloading optimizer states to CPU memory, as seen in ZeroOffload/CPUAdam, can save significant memory, especially for large models.\n\n### Hierarchical and Modular Approaches\nUsing hierarchical or modular architectures can help in managing model states efficiently. For example, LoRA fine-tuning involves training small adapter weights that can be easily integrated into the base model, allowing for efficient memory usage and better performance on specific tasks.\n\n## Techniques for Maintaining Model Adaptability During Compression\n\n### Adaptive Sparse Attention\nImplementing adaptive sparse attention patterns can help maintain model adaptability. Approaches like MoA and SPARSEK Attention allow for content-dependent sparsity, where different attention heads can expand or concentrate their focus based on the input sequence lengths. This adaptability ensures that the model can handle varying contexts efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n### Test-Time Training and Self-Supervised Learning\nTest-time training (TTT) can enhance model adaptability to out-of-distribution test data. TTT involves fine-tuning the model on the test data using self-supervised objectives, which helps the model adapt to new data without requiring additional labeled data. This approach can be integrated with compressed models to maintain their adaptability.\n\n## Integration with Test-Time Training Approaches\n\n### Combining Sparse Attention with Test-Time Training\nIntegrating sparse attention mechanisms with test-time training can be beneficial. For instance, using sparse attention to select relevant KV pairs during test-time training can help in maintaining computational efficiency while adapting to new data. This hybrid approach ensures that the model remains efficient in terms of memory and computation while adapting to unseen data[Analysis Note].\n\n### Self-Supervised Objectives for Compression\nUsing self-supervised objectives during test-time training can also help in maintaining the performance of compressed models. By constructing pseudo-training samples based on predicted masks or other self-supervised tasks, the model can adapt to new data without compromising on the efficiency achieved through compression.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations\nEnsuring that the compressed models and test-time training methods are hardware-efficient is crucial. Techniques like partition-attention and distributed data parallelization can help in scaling computations across multiple GPUs, ensuring consistent computational load and near-full utilization of GPUs.\n\nBy combining these methods, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of memory and computation but also highly adaptable and scalable, especially when integrated with test-time training approaches.\n",

Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/40 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n# Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts \n\nAlexis Chevalier* Alexander Wettig* Anirudh Ajith Danqi Chen<br>Department of Computer Science \\& Princeton Language and Intelligence<br>Princeton University<br>\\{achevalier, anirudh.ajith\\}@princeton.edu<br>\\{awettig, danqic\\}@cs.princeton.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents.\n```\n\n#### 2. Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.50)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

Dai et al. (2019) present Transformer-XL which utilize segment-level recurrence agency and a novel positional encoding scheme. Beltagy et al. (2020) introduce Longformer with a sparse attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length. Bo (2021) provides a faster transformer, RWKV, which combines the strength of RNN and has linear complexity during inference. Dao et al. (2022) propose FlashAttention, a chunking strategy for the input, and utilize recomputation to avoid the quadratic complexity of attention computation. While these methods have the potential to handle longer input sequences (Ding et al., 2023), training new models can be costly. Moreover, these methods are not effective when dealing with out-of-distribution content lengths. The introduction of new positional embeddings requires fine-tuning on long sequences to adapt to the increased length, which can be computationally expensive. To address this, LongLoRA is introduced by Chen et al. (2023b), offering an efficient fine-tuning method with limited computational costs. More details on several other chunking strategies are provided in the survey by Huang et al. (2023). ### 2.3 PROMPTING\n\nThere are ongoing efforts to extend the context window through smart prompting designs. Wingate et al. (2022) utilize soft prompts to encode more information using fewer tokens. Chevalier et al. (2023) present AutoCompressor, which utilizes soft prompts to compress the input sequence and then extends the original length of the base model. Both Zhou et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2023) recurrently apply LLMs to summarize the input texts to maintain long short-term memory for specific purposes such as story writing and dialogue generation, respectively. ## 3 METHODOLOGY\n\nWe propose our semantic compression method for extending the context window. The core idea is to compress the input into shorter texts without losing the key information and important details. This enables us to effectively include more content within the fixed input length constraint of the LLM. Fig. 2 provides an overview of our method, which leverages pre-trained summarization models commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Existing summarization methods also have limitations regarding the length of the input. Here, we propose a divide-and-conquer based approach that takes into account the structure of the text. By identifying the topic structure of lengthy texts and dividing them into blocks that exhibit a certain level of mutual independence, the content within each block can be compressed efficiently due to their statistical correlation. Each block is then processed in parallel using pre-trained models, and the results are combined to create a condensed textual input that can be processed by the LLM. This approach aims to provide a more efficient and effective way of summarizing long texts by leveraging both the structure and content of the original text. ### 3.1 MODEL\n\nReal-world textual content, such as speech and book, frequently displays hierarchical structures, wherein each section is structured around a particular topic, and different sections differ in topic in a sequential manner. This hierarchical structure, based on topics, bears resemblance to cliques in\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-04.jpg?height=557&width=1305&top_left_y=269&top_left_x=388)\n\nFigure 2: An illustration of our semantic compression method. The input text is initially segmented into topic-based chunks, utilizing the graph representation. Subsequently, these chunks undergo refinement using pre-trained models to ensure the preservation of key information. Finally, the refined chunks are assembled in accordance with the original order. The resulting texts, which have been semantically compressed, are approximately 6-8 times shorter in length compared to the original input. Consequently, they fall within the context window of the LLMs. Furthermore, for additional extension of the length, other methods such as extrapolation and interpolation-based techniques can be concatenated. graphs. To identify this structure within long texts, we utilize weighted graphs to represent them and employ clustering methods to detect cliques in these graphs. The cliques can then be utilized to represent the topic-based content of the text, allowing us to obtain chunks based on the semantic relevance of the topics. We begin by sequentially constructing sentence-level blocks within given lengths and representing them as nodes in our graph. In this step, we parse the text into different sentences or sub-sentences based on punctuation marks. Next, we sequentially fill the sentence-level blocks until they exceed the desired length before proceeding to the next blocks. Once we have obtained the sentence-level blocks, we connect the graph representation of long text $\\mathcal{G}$ based on a pre-trained sentence embedding model (e.g., MiniLM (Wang et al., 2020)), where the weight $\\mathcal{G}[i][j]$ represents the semantic similarity between the $i$-th and $j$-th sentence-level blocks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nPingyi Zhou, Lu Hou, Bo Bai, Lei Deng, Wei Han<br>Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. #### Abstract\n\nTransformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) often impose limitations on the length of the text input to ensure the generation of fluent and relevant responses.

These LLMs have demonstrated the ability to engage in fluent and coherent conversations with human users, and have shown exceptional performance across various tasks, including document summarization, question-answering, dialogue bots, and code generation copilots. One critical issue faced by state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs is the restriction on the length of text that can be inputted into the model at once. When the input context exceeds the limit of the context window, the performance of these models rapidly declines. This limitation poses a challenge when it comes to handling long texts such as scientific papers, novels, and legal contracts with current LLMs. As a result, there has been a growing interest in finding ways to extend the input length without significantly compromising the model's performance. The limitation on the context window primarily stems from the quadratic computation of the selfattention mechanism in the transformer. Handling lengthy texts significantly increases the computational costs in terms of memory and time. Typically, models are trained on short contexts, and the maximum sequence length (i.e., the context window) is determined. If the models are compelled to generate contexts that exceed the context window, they tend to compromise the quality of the output due to the lack of position encoding information during the training process. Furthermore, generating long sequences imposes substantial memory requirements on the computational device. This accumulation of memory requirements and the lack of effective position encoding can result in length generalization failure (Anil et al., 2022), where the models struggle to generate meaningful and coherent text beyond a certain context window size. Some approaches have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges. One approach is to devise architectures with nearly linear complexity, which enables efficient scaling to handle\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_cd23c0037d5533aab2e2g-02.jpg?height=139&width=919&top_left_y=272&top_left_x=603)\n\nFigure 1: With the inclusion of the semantic compression module, the redundancies in the input are eliminated, thereby effectively extending the context window. The semantic compression is reminiscent of the concept of source coding in information theory. very long sequences. However, training a large model from scratch incurs substantial cost. Another strategy involves employing interpolation and fine-tuning techniques to adapt the position encoding to unseen sequence lengths. While this method has the potential to compromise the overall performance of LLMs, it still demands significant time and GPU resources for fine-tuning and inference on long sequences. Therefore, it is more efficient and resource-friendly to design methods that do not necessitate altering the parameters of the pre-trained model. While most previous algorithms relied on modifying the pre-trained model, we instead exploit the statistical properties of input natural language. One empirical phenomenon, known as Zipf's law (Zipf, 2016), observes that a small set of the most frequent word tokens in a large corpus of natural language account for almost all occurrences.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive compression techniques parallel processing\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

These schemes are often heuristic and fixed over the course of training. We empirically observe that the statistics of gradients of deep models change during the training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce two adaptive quantization schemes, ALQ and AMQ. In both schemes, processors update their compression schemes in parallel by efficiently computing sufficient statistics of a parametric distribution. We improve the validation accuracy by almost 2% on CIFAR-10 and 1% on ImageNet in challenging low-cost communication setups.

Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression techniques parallel processing*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression techniques parallel processing*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward\"drop-in\"integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

This negatively impacts the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) by increasing runtime and/or decreasing accuracy when reducing model and/or batch size to \ufb01t this capacity. Lossy compression is a promising approach to tackling memory capacity constraints, but prior approaches rely on hyperparameter search to achieve a suitable trade-off between convergence and compression, negating runtime bene\ufb01ts. In this paper we build upon recent developments on Stochastic Gradient Descent convergence to prove an upper bound on the expected loss increase when training with compressed activation storage. We then express activation compression error in terms of this bound, allowing the compression rate to adapt to training conditions automatically. The advantage of our approach, called AC-GC, over existing lossy compression frameworks is that, given a preset allowable increase in loss, signi\ufb01cant compression without signi\ufb01cant increase in error can be achieved with a single training run. When combined with error-bounded methods, AC-GC achieves 15.1 \u00d7 compression with an average accuracy change of 0 . 1% on text and image datasets.

MIMT: Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Video Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression techniques parallel processing*\n\n*Jin-Peng Xiang, Kuan Tian, Jun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCLJCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning video compression outperforms its hand-craft counterparts with enhanced flexibility and capacity. One key component of the learned video codec is the autoregressive entropy model conditioned on spatial and temporal priors. Operating autoregressive on raster scanning order naively treats the context as unidirectional. This is neither efficient nor optimal considering that conditional information probably locates at the end of the sequence. We thus introduce an entropy model based on a masked image modeling transformer (MIMT) to learn the spatial-temporal dependencies. Video frames are first encoded into sequences of tokens and then processed with the transformer encoder as priors. The transformer decoder learns the probability mass functions (PMFs) conditioned on the priors and masked inputs, and then it is capable of selecting optimal decoding orders without a fixed direction. During training, MIMT aims to predict the PMFs of randomly masked tokens by attending to tokens in all directions. This allows MIMT to capture the temporal dependencies from encoded priors and the spatial dependencies from the unmasked tokens, i.e., decoded tokens. At inference time, the model begins with generating PMFs of all masked tokens in parallel and then decodes the frame iteratively from the previously-selected decoded tokens (i.e., with high confidence). In addition, we improve the overall performance with more techniques, e.g., manifold conditional priors accumulating a long range of information, shifted window attention to reduce complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed MIMT framework equipped with the new transformer entropy model achieves state-of-the-art performance on HEVC, UVG, and MCLJCV datasets, generally outperforming the VVC in terms of PSNR and SSIM.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive compression techniques and efficient parallel processing of compressed states, here are some key points and methods derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Different Approaches to Adaptive Compression\n\n1. **Adaptive Compression in Distributed Training**:\n   The paper on FusionLLM introduces an adaptive compression technique, specifically the AdaTopK compressor, which adaptively compresses intermediate activations and gradients at the slowest communication links. This method helps in reducing the communication overhead during distributed training, which is crucial for large language models.\n\n2. **Equal-Info Windowing**:\n   This technique involves segmenting text into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. It demonstrates effective learning over neurally compressed text and improves with scale, suggesting a balanced approach to compression that maintains learnability - Analysis Note.\n\n3. **Dynamic Dictionary Models**:\n   Adaptive dictionary methods, such as those described in data compression algorithms (e.g., Lempel-Ziv algorithms), can be adapted for neural compression. These methods build a table of strings and replace occurrences with shorter codes, which can be dynamically updated based on the input data.\n\n### Methods for Efficient Parallel Processing of Compressed States\n\n1. **Model Parallelism**:\n   This approach involves splitting the model across multiple computing resources. Techniques like pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism can be used to process different parts of the model simultaneously, reducing the overall training time and improving efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for large models that exceed the memory capacity of a single device.\n\n2. **Load Balancing and Communication Strategies**:\n   Efficient parallel processing requires load balancing to ensure each device has an equal workload, minimizing bottlenecks and idle resources.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/38 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nAssociation for Computing Machinery.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention compressed states parallel updates*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Teh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Powerpropagation, a new weight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse models and advocates the use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed representations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** The training of sparse neural networks is becoming an increasingly important tool for reducing the computational footprint of models at training and evaluation, as well enabling the effective scaling up of models. Whereas much work over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques, little attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based training on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new weight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse models. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to weight updates exhibiting a\"rich get richer\"dynamic, leaving low-magnitude parameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner exhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher density at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation is general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily be combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we explore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of work, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained settings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning technique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms, showing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate the use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed representations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model capacity. In all cases our reparameterisation considerably increases the efficacy of the off-the-shelf methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. Multimodal Phased Transformer for Sentiment Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention compressed states parallel updates*\n\n*Junyan Cheng, Iordanis Fostiropoulos, B. Boehm, M. Soleymani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes multimodal Sparse Phased Transformer (SPT), a model that uses a sampling function to generate a sparse attention matrix and compress a long sequence to a shorter sequence of hidden states and concurrently captures interactions between the hidden states of different modalities at every layer.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal Transformers achieve superior performance in multimodal learning tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformers limits their deployment in low-resource devices and makes their inference and training computationally expensive. We propose multimodal Sparse Phased Transformer (SPT) to alleviate the problem of self-attention complexity and memory footprint. SPT uses a sampling function to generate a sparse attention matrix and compress a long sequence to a shorter sequence of hidden states. SPT concurrently captures interactions between the hidden states of different modalities at every layer. To further improve the efficiency of our method, we use Layer-wise parameter sharing and Factorized Co-Attention that share parameters between Cross Attention Blocks, with minimal impact on task performance. We evaluate our model with three sentiment analysis datasets and achieve comparable or superior performance compared with the existing methods, with a 90% reduction in the number of parameters. We conclude that (SPT) along with parameter sharing can capture multimodal interactions with reduced model size and improved sample efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by combining sparse attention with compressed states and efficient parallel state updates, here are some key methods and strategies based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Methods for Integrating Sparse Attention with Compressed Representations\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nSparse sequence-to-sequence models, such as the Sparse Transformer, are particularly effective in reducing computational complexity. The Sparse Transformer applies sparse factorizations to self-attention matrices, reducing the complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n\\sqrt{n})\\). This approach allows for efficient processing of long input sequences while maintaining performance.\n\n### Compressed States\nCompressing optimizer states and activations can significantly reduce memory footprint. The COAT framework, for example, uses Dynamic Range Expansion and Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization to optimize memory usage without significant performance degradation. This involves quantizing optimizer states and activations into FP8 format, which is crucial for efficient state management.\n\n## Techniques for Efficient Parallel State Updates\n\n### Hardware-Aware Algorithm Design\nEfficient parallel state updates can be achieved through hardware-aware algorithm design. For instance, using OpenVINO with 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable Processors, you can enable sparsity optimization at the model compilation step. This involves setting the `CPU_SPARSE_WEIGHTS_DECOMPRESSION_RATE` property to optimize MatMul operations, which is particularly beneficial in throughput-oriented scenarios.\n\n### Load Balancing and DAG-Based Execution\nLoad balancing strategies and DAG-based execution optimization are essential for efficient parallel processing. Adaptive Gradient Quantization techniques allow processors to update their compression schemes in parallel by computing sufficient statistics of a parametric distribution, ensuring efficient communication between parallel units[Analysis Note].\n\n### Parallel Quantization\nThe COAT framework also demonstrates how to perform parallel quantization efficiently. By using mixed-granularity FP8 precision flow, it balances precision and efficiency across different layers, reducing the overhead associated with additional quantization steps.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Parallel Processing of Compressed States\n\n### Exploiting Weight Sparsity\nHardware accelerators like the Efficient Inference Engine (EIE) designed by Song Han exploit weight sparsity to improve inference efficiency. This involves identifying new sources of sparsity such as sparse attention and token pruning, and implementing efficient systems and accelerators to leverage these sparsities.\n\n### Optimized Storage Formats\nUsing sparse tensors and optimized storage formats like COO, CSR, CSC, and LIL can significantly reduce memory footprint and computational resources. These formats are particularly beneficial when the data is predominantly zero, leading to faster computation times.\n\n### Specialized Hardware and Software\nUtilizing specialized hardware and software, such as OpenVINO runtime with 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable Processors, can accelerate the inference of sparse transformer models. This setup optimizes MatMul operations and provides significant performance improvements, especially in memory-bound deployment scenarios.\n\nBy integrating these methods and strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage sparse attention, compressed states, and efficient parallel updates, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention:**\n\n  - **MoA (Mixture of Attention):** Fu et al. introduce MoA, which tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers using a gating mechanism. This aligns closely with the proposal's aim to implement adaptive sparse attention patterns through a mixture of attention approach.\n\n  - **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA):** Ren et al. propose SMA, enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules (e.g., GAUs) based on state representations. This approach highlights the potential of dynamic module activation to improve efficiency, which is relevant for integrating adaptive sparse attention in the FastTTTLinear framework.\n\n  - **SAC (Sparse Adaptive Connection):** Li et al. present SAC, where the model learns to construct attention edges dynamically, reducing complexity regardless of sequence length. This method supports the feasibility of adaptive sparse attention mechanisms.\n\n  - **Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST):** Yang et al. propose AST, which mitigates noisy interactions and removes feature redundancy using an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention block. Although focused on image restoration, the principles can be transferred to language models.\n\n- **Efficient State Compression:**\n\n  - **Dynamic Context Pruning:** Anagnostidis et al. demonstrate that dynamically pruning context can reduce computational and memory requirements without significantly affecting performance. This method involves a learnable mechanism to determine which tokens to drop, relevant for efficient state compression.\n\n  - **Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers:** Dolga et al. introduce a method to reduce the time complexity of attention mechanisms to linear, based on latent vectors. This contributes insights into efficient state representations and management.\n\n- **Test-Time Training (TTT):**\n\n  - **Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision:** Sun et al. propose updating model parameters during test time using self-supervision to improve generalization under distribution shifts. This underlines the potential benefits of integrating adaptive mechanisms during test time.\n\n- **Novelty Assessment:**\n\n  - While several works explore adaptive sparse attention and efficient state management individually, none explicitly combine these elements within a test-time training framework like FastTTTLinear. The integration of adaptive sparse attention patterns and dynamic state compression through a mixture of attention approach in a TTT setting appears to be a novel contribution.\n\n- **Implementation Challenges:**\n\n  - **Training Stability:** Integrating dynamic mechanisms may introduce training instability. Ensuring proper normalization, regularization, and possibly gradient clipping is essential.\n\n  - **Complexity of Integration:** Combining adaptive sparse attention, mixture of experts, and dynamic state compression requires careful architectural design. Synchronization between components and efficient routing mechanisms are crucial.\n\n  - **Routing Mechanisms:** Implementing mixture of attention or experts involves designing gating networks or routing mechanisms that are efficient and do not introduce significant overhead.\n\n  - **Maintaining Test-Time Training Capabilities:** Ensuring that the integration does not hinder the model's ability to adapt during test time is important. The design should preserve or enhance TTT functionalities.\n\n---\n\n**4.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

None of the referenced works explicitly combine these elements in the same way, especially within a TTT setting.\n\n### Adaptive Sparse Attention\n\n- **Mixture of Attention (MoA):** Fu et al.'s MoA tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, which is closely aligned with the proposal's aim. MoA increases the effective context length and narrows the performance gap between sparse and dense models.\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA):** Ren et al.'s SMA enables neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules based on state representations, which can improve efficiency and is relevant for integrating adaptive sparse attention.\n- **Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC):** Li et al.'s SAC learns to construct attention edges dynamically, reducing complexity regardless of sequence length. This supports the feasibility of adaptive sparse attention mechanisms.\n- **Adaptive Attention for Sparse-based Long-sequence Transformers:** Zhang et al.'s work on adaptive attention mechanisms that dynamically adjust attention patterns based on input content is also relevant.\n\n### Efficient State Compression\n\n- **Dynamic Context Pruning:** Anagnostidis et al.'s method dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness. This can reduce computational and memory requirements without significant performance loss.\n- **Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers:** Dolga et al.'s approach reduces the time complexity of attention mechanisms to linear scaling with sequence length using latent vectors. This contributes to efficient state representations and management.\n\n### Test-Time Training (TTT)\n\n- **Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision:** Sun et al.'s work on updating model parameters during test time using self-supervision is crucial for improving generalization under distribution shifts. This underlines the potential benefits of integrating adaptive mechanisms during test time.\n\n### Implementation Challenges and Considerations\n\n- **Training Stability:** Ensuring proper normalization, regularization, and possibly gradient clipping is essential to avoid training instability when integrating dynamic mechanisms.\n- **Complexity of Integration:** Combining adaptive sparse attention, MoE, and dynamic state compression requires careful architectural design. Synchronization between components and efficient routing mechanisms are crucial.\n- **Routing Mechanisms:** Implementing mixture of attention or experts involves designing gating networks or routing mechanisms that are efficient and do not introduce significant overhead.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further support the researcher's goals:\n\n- **Recent Publications:** Search for the latest research (2023-2024) on integrating adaptive mechanisms within TTT frameworks, focusing on top-tier conferences and journals (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, arXiv preprints).\n- **Practical Implementations and Benchmarks:** Identify practical implementations or benchmarks where similar methods have been applied to understand real-world challenges and performance.\n- **Related Fields:** Consider research in related domains like computer vision or reinforcement learning, where similar concepts may have been explored.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **Fu, T., Han, K., Richardson, J., et al.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention:**\n\n  - **MoA (Mixture of Attention):** Fu et al. introduce MoA, which tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers using a gating mechanism. This aligns closely with the proposal's aim to implement adaptive sparse attention patterns through a mixture of attention approach.\n\n  - **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA):** Ren et al. propose SMA, enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules (e.g., GAUs) based on state representations. This approach highlights the potential of dynamic module activation to improve efficiency, which is relevant for integrating adaptive sparse attention in the FastTTTLinear framework.\n\n  - **SAC (Sparse Adaptive Connection):** Li et al. present SAC, where the model learns to construct attention edges dynamically, reducing complexity regardless of sequence length. This method supports the feasibility of adaptive sparse attention mechanisms.\n\n  - **Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST):** Yang et al. propose AST, which mitigates noisy interactions and removes feature redundancy using an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention block. Although focused on image restoration, the principles can be transferred to language models.\n\n- **Efficient State Compression:**\n\n  - **Dynamic Context Pruning:** Anagnostidis et al. demonstrate that dynamically pruning context can reduce computational and memory requirements without significantly affecting performance. This method involves a learnable mechanism to determine which tokens to drop, relevant for efficient state compression.\n\n  - **Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers:** Dolga et al. introduce a method to reduce the time complexity of attention mechanisms to linear, based on latent vectors.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n## 2.

Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n#### 5. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 17 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Adaptive sparse attention, Mixture of experts, State compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Conditional computation, where parts of the network are active on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and performance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally realize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x improvements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational efficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward sub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of these experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of language modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for absorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora. We present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters is applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers.

However, conventional MoEs pose challenges at scale due to the need to store all experts in memory. In this paper, we push MoE to the limit.

Darrell, Denny Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** The advancements embodied by FLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing inference cost. Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMs to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, FLAN-MOE-32B, surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM-62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs.

Wang, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yan Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Both mask decay and residual representation learning greatly improve the RD performance of the scalable encoder, which significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for the medium and small models, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural image compression has surpassed state-of-the-art traditional codecs (H.266/VVC) for rate-distortion (RD) performance, but suffers from large complexity and separate models for different rate-distortion trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an Efficient single-model Variable-bit-rate Codec (EVC), which is able to run at 30 FPS with 768x512 input images and still outperforms VVC for the RD performance. By further reducing both encoder and decoder complexities, our small model even achieves 30 FPS with 1920x1080 input images. To bridge the performance gap between our different capacities models, we meticulously design the mask decay, which transforms the large model's parameters into the small model automatically. And a novel sparsity regularization loss is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of $L_p$ regularization. Our algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for our medium and small models, respectively. At last, we advocate the scalable encoder for neural image compression. The encoding complexity is dynamic to meet different latency requirements. We propose decaying the large encoder multiple times to reduce the residual representation progressively.

Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations.

Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Hybrid Tensor-Expert-Data Parallelism Approach to Optimize Mixture-of-Experts Training\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of experts*\n\n*Abhinav Bhatele, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Olatunji Ruwase, Siddharth Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural network architecture that adds sparsely activated expert blocks to a base model, increasing the number of parameters without impacting computational costs. However, current distributed deep learning frameworks are limited in their ability to train high-quality MoE models with large base models. In this work, we present DeepSpeed-TED, a novel, three-dimensional, hybrid parallel algorithm that combines data, tensor, and expert parallelism to enable the training of MoE models with 4 to 8x larger base models than the current state-of-the-art. We also describe memory optimizations in the optimizer step, and communication optimizations that eliminate unnecessary data movement. We implement our approach in DeepSpeed and achieve speedups of 26% over a baseline (i.e. without our communication optimizations) when training a 40 billion parameter MoE model (6.7 billion base model with 16 experts) on 128 V100 GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of experts*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach. Codes are available online: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/moe_mtl.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Low Bitrate High-Quality RVQGAN-based Discrete Speech Tokenizer\n\n*From Search Query: State compression*\n\n*Avihu Dekel, Slava Shechtman*\n\n**Abstract:** Discrete Audio codecs (or audio tokenizers) have recently regained interest due to the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn their compressed acoustic representations. Various publicly available trainable discrete tokenizers recently demonstrated impressive results for audio tokenization, yet they mostly require high token rates to gain high-quality reconstruction. In this study, we fine-tuned an open-source general audio RVQGAN model using diverse open-source speech data, considering various recording conditions and quality levels. The resulting wideband (24kHz) speech-only model achieves speech reconstruction, which is nearly indistinguishable from PCM (pulse-code modulation) with a rate of 150-300 tokens per second (1500-3000 bps). The evaluation used comprehensive English speech data encompassing different recording conditions, including studio settings. Speech samples are made publicly available in http://ibm.biz/IS24SpeechRVQ . The model is officially released in https://huggingface.co/ibm/DAC.speech.v1.0\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-10\n\n\n\n#### 6. High-Fidelity Audio Compression with Improved RVQGAN\n\n*From Search Query: State compression*\n\n*Kundan Kumar, Ishaan Kumar, Alejandro Luebs, Prem Seetharaman, Rithesh Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** Language models have been successfully used to model natural signals, such as images, speech, and music. A key component of these models is a high quality neural compression model that can compress high-dimensional natural signals into lower dimensional discrete tokens. To that end, we introduce a high-fidelity universal neural audio compression algorithm that achieves ~90x compression of 44.1 KHz audio into tokens at just 8kbps bandwidth. We achieve this by combining advances in high-fidelity audio generation with better vector quantization techniques from the image domain, along with improved adversarial and reconstruction losses. We compress all domains (speech, environment, music, etc.) with a single universal model, making it widely applicable to generative modeling of all audio. We compare with competing audio compression algorithms, and find our method outperforms them significantly. We provide thorough ablations for every design choice, as well as open-source code and trained model weights. We hope our work can lay the foundation for the next generation of high-fidelity audio modeling.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates adaptive sparse attention and dynamic state compression, here are some key insights and relevant information from the available sources and general knowledge in the field:\n\n## Adaptive Sparse Attention\n\n- **Existing Models:** Models like the Sparse Transformer, Longformer, and Big Bird have introduced various sparse attention patterns to reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. These models are designed to handle long sequences efficiently but may not be integrated within a test-time training framework like FastTTTLinear.\n- **Content-Aware Sparse Attention:** The concept of adaptive or content-aware sparse attention is crucial. While the provided sources do not specifically mention such implementations, research in this area often involves dynamic adjustment of attention patterns based on the input content. For example, the MTSFormer model uses a combination of time and sensor tokens with self-attention to capture high-level information, which could be a starting point for adapting sparse attention mechanisms.\n\n## Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n\n- **Switch Transformers:** MoE models, such as Switch Transformers, use gating mechanisms to route inputs to different experts, increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computational cost. Integrating MoE with sparse attention and dynamic state compression could be a novel contribution, especially if it is applied within a test-time training framework.\n\n## Dynamic State Compression\n\n- **Efficient State Management:** Dynamic state compression is essential for models processing long sequences to reduce memory usage. Techniques such as those used in the MTSFormer, which employs a gated mechanism for adaptively constructing locality representations, can be insightful. This model uses a combination of self-attention and feedforward layers to manage and compress states effectively.\n- **State Compression in LMs:** Research on state compression in language models often focuses on compressing intermediate states based on their importance. This can involve techniques like layer normalization and residual connections to stabilize the data distribution and mitigate gradient vanishing, as seen in the MTSFormer model.\n\n## Test-Time Training Capabilities\n\n- **FastTTTLinear:** The FastTTTLinear model enables test-time adaptation of hidden states, which is crucial for handling long sequences. The proposed integration of adaptive sparse attention and dynamic state compression must ensure that these test-time training capabilities are maintained. This involves ensuring that the model can adaptively adjust attention patterns and compress states during test-time training without compromising performance.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Methods\n\n- **Efficiency & Scalability:** The MTSFormer model, for example, uses a multi-view self-attention mechanism and fusion approach to capture both global and local information efficiently. This model demonstrates improved efficiency and scalability by integrating time, value, and sparse mask information, which could be a useful comparison point for the proposed FastTTTLinear enhancements.\n\n## Implementation Challenges\n\n- **Theoretical & Practical Challenges:** Implementing content-aware sparsity and dynamic state management within the FastTTTLinear framework may involve challenges such as avoiding gradient vanishing, ensuring stable data distribution in the hidden space, and maintaining the mutual information between different views. The use of residual connections and layer normalization, as seen in the MTSFormer model, can help address these challenges.\n\n### Key Insights and References\n\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention:**\n  - While the provided sources do not directly address adaptive sparse attention within a test-time training framework, models like MTSFormer show how self-attention mechanisms can be adapted for different views, which could be extended to sparse attention patterns.\n\n- **Mixture of Experts:**\n  - Integrating MoE with sparse attention and dynamic state compression is a promising area of research. Switch Transformers and similar models provide a foundation for this integration.\n\n- **Dynamic State Compression:**\n  - The MTSFormer model's use of gated mechanisms and self-attention for state compression is a relevant example.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B.

As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention (Avg.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented. TNL outperforms existing efficient language models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art large language models using conventional transformer architectures. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

By addressing the limitations of linear attention in varying sequence lengths without increasing memory consumption, this advancement democratizes access to state-of-the-art language models, potentially reducing the computational and environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems. Ethically, it underscores a move towards more sustainable AI practices, yet raises questions about the proliferation of powerful language models and their societal impacts, including concerns over privacy, misinformation, and the digital divide. ## References\n\nAlmazrouei, E., Alobeidli, H., Alshamsi, A., Cappelli, A., Cojocaru, R., Debbah, M., Goffinet, E., Heslow, D., Launay, J., Malartic, Q., et al.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/14 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nGeoffrey E.

Score: 0.84)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Score: 0.61)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive Connection\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, it is demonstrated SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of tasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the input length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks.

COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods and can be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training and lower extra storage cost than the existing works.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. HPTQ: Hardware-Friendly Post Training Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Arnon Netzer, Roy H. Jennings, Idit Diamant, Oranit Dror, Lior Dikstein, Elad Cohen, Reuven Peretz, Hai Victor Habi*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network quantization enables the deployment of models on edge devices. An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates adaptive sparse attention, efficient state compression, and test-time training, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Adaptive Sparse Attention\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This mechanism introduces a learnable gate to adaptively identify sparse block locations in attention maps, which can significantly improve efficiency without predefined sparsity patterns.

Ensuring that these mechanisms work seamlessly within a test-time training framework is crucial. The literature suggests that combining these elements is novel and could offer significant improvements in efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Challenges\n\n- **Training Stability**: Integrating adaptive attention mechanisms and dynamic state compression may introduce training instability. Ensuring proper normalization and regularization is essential to maintain stability (from the analysis note).\n\n- **Complexity of Integration**: Combining adaptive sparse attention, mixture of experts, and dynamic state compression requires careful architectural design to avoid bottlenecks and ensure that the components interact effectively (from the analysis note).\n\n## Relevant References\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism that enhances standard attention with a learnable gate to adaptively identify sparse block locations in attention maps. This is highly relevant for integrating adaptive sparse attention into the proposed model.\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: The CNN-LSTM-ASAN model uses an adaptive sparse attention network (ASAN) to enhance feature extraction and reduce computational costs. This provides a practical example of how sparse attention can be integrated into a model to improve efficiency.\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: FlashAttention and other efficient attention mechanisms can provide insights into optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency, which are crucial for the proposed model (from the analysis note).\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages adaptive sparse attention, efficient state compression, and test-time training to achieve improved efficiency, scalability, and performance without compromising accuracy or robustness.\n",

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention:**\n\n  - **Mixture of Attention (MoA):** Fu et al. propose integrating multiple sparse attention patterns with a gating mechanism, allowing the model to adaptively select attention patterns based on the input. This aligns closely with the proposal's aim to implement adaptive sparse attention through a mixture of attention approach.\n\n  - **SparseK Attention:** Lou et al. introduce SparseK Attention, utilizing a scoring network and a differentiable top-k operator to select key-value pairs dynamically. This method reduces computational complexity and memory usage, which is relevant for improving efficiency in handling long sequences.\n\n  - **FlashAttention:** Dao et al.'s FlashAttention optimizes attention computation by reducing memory access overheads. While not directly about sparse attention, the focus on efficiency and memory usage is pertinent.\n\n- **Dynamic State Compression:**\n\n  - **DenseMamba:** He et al. enhance state space models by integrating hidden states across layers, improving information flow and model efficiency. This approach provides insights into efficient state management, which is critical for the proposed dynamic state compression.\n\n- **Linear Attention in Autoregressive Models:**\n\n  - **Linearized LLMs:** You et al. explore linear attention methods in autoregressive language models, introducing techniques to improve efficiency during training and inference. Their work underscores the challenges and potential solutions in applying linear attention mechanisms in autoregressive settings, which is relevant to the FastTTTLinear framework.\n\n- **Implementation Challenges:**\n\n  - **Training Stability:** Integrating adaptive attention mechanisms and dynamic state compression may introduce training instability. Ensuring proper normalization and regularization is essential.\n\n  - **Complexity of Integration:** Combining adaptive sparse attention, mixture of experts, and dynamic state compression requires careful architectural design to ensure seamless interaction and avoid bottlenecks.\n\n- **Novelty Assessment:**\n\n  - Based on the reviewed literature, while there are works on adaptive sparse attention (e.g., MoA) and efficient state management (e.g., DenseMamba), none explicitly combine these elements within a test-time training framework like FastTTTLinear. This suggests that the proposal introduces a novel integration.\n\n---\n\n**4.
