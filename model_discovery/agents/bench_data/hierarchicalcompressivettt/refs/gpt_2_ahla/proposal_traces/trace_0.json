Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Explain and Improve: LRP-Inference Fine-Tuning for Image Captioning\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanism*\n\n*Jiamei Sun, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the predictions of image captioning models with attention\nmechanisms beyond visualizing the attention itself. We develop variants of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and gradient-based explanation methods,\ntailored to image captioning models with attention mechanisms. We compare the\ninterpretability of attention heatmaps systematically against the explanations\nprovided by explanation methods such as LRP, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM. We\nshow that explanation methods provide simultaneously pixel-wise image\nexplanations (supporting and opposing pixels of the input image) and linguistic\nexplanations (supporting and opposing words of the preceding sequence) for each\nword in the predicted captions. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that\nexplanation methods 1) can reveal additional evidence used by the model to make\ndecisions compared to attention; 2) correlate to object locations with high\nprecision; 3) are helpful to \"debug\" the model, e.g. by analyzing the reasons\nfor hallucinated object words. With the observed properties of explanations, we\nfurther design an LRP-inference fine-tuning strategy that reduces the issue of\nobject hallucination in image captioning models, and meanwhile, maintains the\nsentence fluency. We conduct experiments with two widely used attention\nmechanisms: the adaptive attention mechanism calculated with the additive\nattention and the multi-head attention mechanism calculated with the scaled dot\nproduct.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-04T05:15:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-08-01T06:27:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Density Adaptive Attention is All You Need: Robust Parameter-Efficient\n  Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanism*\n\n*Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a\nnovel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer\n(DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities,\nincluding Speech, Text, and Vision. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance\ninto its attention mechanism, implemented in a multi-head framework, enabling\nit to collectively model any probability distribution for dynamic recalibration\nof feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements,\nespecially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art\nattention techniques in model performance, up to approximately +20% (abs.) in\naccuracy. Empirically, DAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across\na diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image\nclassification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness\nand versatility in handling data across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the Importance Factor, a new learning-based metric that enhances the\nexplainability of models trained with DAAM-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-20T06:42:32Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-29T00:45:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

We propose\nLOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for\nconditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational\ncomplexity of $O(L \\log L)$, this architecture can handle significantly longer\nsequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention\npatterns.

But in practice,\nstate space models have fairly large state sizes, and we conjecture that they\nshould be able to perform much better at these tasks than previously reported.\nWe investigate whether their poor copying and recall performance could be due\nin part to training difficulties rather than fundamental capacity constraints.\nBased on observations of their \"attention\" maps, we propose a structured\ninitialization technique that allows state space layers to more readily mimic\nattention. Across a variety of architecture settings, our initialization makes\nit substantially easier for Mamba to learn to copy and do associative recall\nfrom scratch.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanism*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. AOE-Net: Entities Interactions Modeling with Adaptive Attention Mechanism for Temporal Action Proposals Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanism*\n\n*Ngan Le, Minh-Triet Tran, Bhiksha Raj, Kashu Yamazaki, Sang Truong, Khoa Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task, which requires localizing action intervals in an untrimmed video. Intuitively, we as humans, perceive an action through the interactions between actors, relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Despite the significant progress of TAPG, a vast majority of existing methods ignore the aforementioned principle of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e., perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: state space model*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: state space model*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on efficiency improvements, scalability, and the integration of adaptive attention mechanisms, linear attention variants, and state space models, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The **Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)** proposed in is a novel approach that integrates learnable mean and variance into the attention mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its attention focus in response to the input data distribution, enhancing its performance, especially with highly non-stationary data. DAAM demonstrates significant improvements in accuracy and adaptability.\n\n- The **Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT)**, also discussed in, enhances information aggregation across multiple modalities by using a multi-head framework. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the attention distribution, ensuring it is both broadly and focusedly distributed as needed, which is crucial for handling complex and varying input data.\n\n## Linear Attention Variants\n\n- **Linear attention mechanisms** have been developed to address the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms. For instance, the integration of state-space models (SSMs) into linear attention mechanisms, such as in **SSMFastTTTLinear**, enhances long-sequence modeling capabilities while maintaining computational efficiency. SSMs compute sequences with linear complexity O(L), where L is the sequence length.\n\n- **Linear Transformers** and their variants, such as those using kernel methods or linearized attention, reduce the computational complexity from O(L^2) to O(L), making them more efficient for handling long sequences.\n\n## State Space Models\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)** are effective in complementing attention mechanisms by handling long-range dependencies efficiently. SSMs can be combined with attention mechanisms to enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities without increasing computational complexity exponentially.\n\n- The use of SSMs in language models allows for better handling of long-range dependencies and maintains computational efficiency, which is a key challenge in traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Recurrent Attention Networks (RANs)**, as discussed in the analysis, enable recurrent operation of self-attention, making them compatible with both sequential and classification tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. This approach balances efficiency and effectiveness, which is crucial for scalable models.\n\n- **Structured sparsity** and **gradient-based importance estimation** in adaptive attention mechanisms, such as in **AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear**, allow for dynamic adjustment of attention patterns based on input context. This improves both efficiency and expressiveness, which are essential for scalable and efficient language models.\n\n## Integration Strategies and Design Principles\n\n- **Universal Transformers (UTs)** combine the strengths of feed-forward sequence models and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), offering a modular and flexible architecture. This combination is beneficial for tasks that require both parallelizability and recurrent processing, highlighting the importance of integrating different architectural components.\n\n- The design principles of modularity, preserving model expressiveness during efficiency optimizations, and using adaptive components to balance resource usage are crucial for developing scalable and efficient autoregressive language models.\n\nBy incorporating these advancements, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling complex and varied input data effectively.\n",

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state management, hybrid attention architecture, hardware optimization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Lingxiao Ma, Lei Wang, Wenhui Wang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Ruiping Wang, Jilong Xue, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant,\nnamely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is\nternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16)\nTransformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both\nperplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more\ncost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption.\nMore profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for\ntraining new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and\ncost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens\nthe door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-27T18:56:19Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-27T18:56:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

HeterPS: Distributed Deep Learning With Reinforcement Learning Based Scheduling in Heterogeneous Environments\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management*\n\n*Dejing Dou, Xuefeng Yao, Xinxuan Wu, Minxu Zhang, Danlei Feng, Yanjun Ma, dianhai yu, Zhihua Wu, Ji Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) exploit many layers and a large number of parameters to achieve excellent performance. The training process of DNN models generally handles large-scale input data with many sparse features, which incurs high Input/Output (IO) cost, while some layers are compute-intensive. The training process generally exploits distributed computing resources to reduce training time. In addition, heterogeneous computing resources, e.g., CPUs, GPUs of multiple types, are available for the distributed training process. Thus, the scheduling of multiple layers to diverse computing resources is critical for the training process. To efficiently train a DNN model using the heterogeneous computing resources, we propose a distributed framework, i.e., Paddle-Heterogeneous Parameter Server (Paddle-HeterPS), composed of a distributed architecture and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based scheduling method. The advantages of Paddle-HeterPS are three-fold compared with existing frameworks. First, Paddle-HeterPS enables efficient training process of diverse workloads with heterogeneous computing resources. Second, Paddle-HeterPS exploits an RL-based method to efficiently schedule the workload of each layer to appropriate computing resources to minimize the cost while satisfying throughput constraints. Third, Paddle-HeterPS manages data storage and data communication among distributed computing resources. We carry out extensive experiments to show that Paddle-HeterPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of throughput (14.5 times higher) and monetary cost (312.3% smaller).

OneFlow: Redesign the Distributed Deep Learning Framework from Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management*\n\n*Jie Zhao, Haoran Zhang, Chuan Wu, Xiaodong Yi, Fei Yang, Chi Yao, Shenghang Cai, Ran Guo, Juncheng Liu, Cheng Cheng, Xinqi Li, Jinhui Yuan*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch provide a productive interface for expressing and training a deep neural network (DNN) model on a single device or using data parallelism. Still, they may not be flexible or efficient enough in training emerging large models on distributed devices, which require more sophisticated parallelism beyond data parallelism. Plugins or wrappers have been developed to strengthen these frameworks for model or pipeline parallelism, but they complicate the usage and implementation of distributed deep learning. Aiming at a simple, neat redesign of distributed deep learning frameworks for various parallelism paradigms, we present OneFlow, a novel distributed training framework based on an SBP (split, broadcast and partial-value) abstraction and the actor model. SBP enables much easier programming of data parallelism and model parallelism than existing frameworks, and the actor model provides a succinct runtime mechanism to manage the complex dependencies imposed by resource constraints, data movement and computation in distributed deep learning. We demonstrate the general applicability and efficiency of OneFlow for training various large DNN models with case studies and extensive experiments. The results show that OneFlow outperforms many well-known customized libraries built on top of the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Hybrid Window Attention Based Transformer Architecture for Brain Tumor Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention architecture*\n\n*Mehrtash Harandi, Gary Egan, Zhaolin Chen, Munawar Hayat, Himashi Peiris*\n\n**Abstract:** As intensities of MRI volumes are inconsistent across institutes, it is essential to extract universal features of multi-modal MRIs to precisely segment brain tumors. In this concept, we propose a volumetric vision transformer that follows two windowing strategies in attention for extracting fine features and local distributional smoothness (LDS) during model training inspired by virtual adversarial training (VAT) to make the model robust. We trained and evaluated network architecture on the FeTS Challenge 2022 dataset. Our performance on the online validation dataset is as follows: Dice Similarity Score of 81.71%, 91.38% and 85.40%; Hausdorff Distance (95%) of 14.81 mm, 3.93 mm, 11.18 mm for the enhancing tumor, whole tumor, and tumor core, respectively. Overall, the experimental results verify our method's effectiveness by yielding better performance in segmentation accuracy for each tumor sub-region.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Sergey Levine, Kevin Swersky, Milad Hashemi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Aviral Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a \"simulation-driven\" approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a \"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Conference:** data-driven-offline-optimization-for\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficient and Modular Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Jean-Philippe Vert, Fabian Pedregosa, Felipe Llinares-L\u00f3pez, Stephan Hoyer, Roy Frostig, Marco Cuturi, Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel*\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.\n\n**Conference:** efficient-and-modular-implicit-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on efficient state management, hybrid attention architectures, and hardware-aware optimization strategies is crucial. Here are some key points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Efficient State Management Techniques\n\n1. **State Space Models**:\n   Models like LOCOST and Mamba utilize state space models to handle long sequences efficiently. These models reduce computational complexity and memory usage significantly. For example, LOCOST achieves a computational complexity of O(L log L) and saves up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference.\n\n2. **Structured Sparsity and Normalization**:\n   Techniques such as normalizing state and using structured sparsity can make state management more efficient. Normalizing state, as seen in Redux patterns, can simplify updates and reduce complexity.\n   In the context of language models, structured sparsity can help in reducing the number of parameters and computations required, making the model more efficient.\n\n## Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n1. **Combining Linear and Softmax Attention**:\n   Research like \"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine\" and \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" suggests combining linear attention mechanisms with properties of softmax attention to achieve both efficiency and expressiveness. Linear attention can be optimized to mimic the low-entropy weights and dot-product monotonicity of softmax attention, thereby closing the performance gap.\n\n2. **Density-Adaptive Attention**:\n   Density Adaptive Attention Mechanisms (DAAM) integrate learnable mean and variance into the attention mechanism, enabling dynamic recalibration of feature significance. This approach can be combined with other attention mechanisms to handle varied input distributions effectively.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **I/O-Aware Implementations**:\n   Implementations that are aware of input/output operations can significantly improve the performance of attention mechanisms. For instance, \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" emphasize the need for I/O-aware implementations to match the efficiency of highly optimized softmax attention implementations.\n\n2. **Hardware-Efficient Training**:\n   Strategies like those discussed in \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" focus on hardware-efficient training methods. These include optimizing memory access patterns and leveraging hardware capabilities to speed up computations.\n\n3. **Server-Side State Management**:\n   Although not directly applicable to language models, the concept of server-side state management in frameworks like NextJS can provide insights into managing state efficiently in distributed or parallel computing environments. Techniques such as using cache functions and request memoization can be adapted to optimize state management in large-scale language models.\n\n## Key Insights for Design\n\n- **Architectural Considerations**:\n  - Combine linear attention with density-adaptive mechanisms and state space models.\n  - Implement hardware-aware optimizations.\n  - Use learnable parameters for dynamic adaptation to input characteristics.\n\n- **Implementation Strategies**:\n  - Focus on I/O-aware implementations.\n  - Maintain softmax-like properties while achieving linear complexity.\n  - Incorporate structured sparsity for efficiency.\n  - Design for hardware efficiency and balance computational efficiency with model expressiveness.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Advances in Efficient State Management**:\n  Investigate recent papers on state space models, structured sparsity, and normalization techniques that can be applied to language models.\n\n- **Combining Attention Mechanisms with State Space Models**:\n  Look into research that integrates different attention mechanisms with state space models, such as LOCOST and Mamba, to achieve efficient sequence processing.\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementation Strategies**:\n  Explore papers and technical documents on I/O-aware implementations, hardware-efficient training methods, and optimizing memory access patterns.\n\n- **Training Stability in Hybrid Architectures**:\n  Investigate methods to ensure training stability when combining multiple architectural innovations, such as linear attention, softmax attention, and state space models.\n\n### References\n\n1. **Zhang, M., Bhatia, K., Kumbong, H., & R\u00e9, C.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/24 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Break the Sequential Dependency of LLM Inference Using Lookahead\n  Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention*\n\n*Yichao Fu, Peter Bailis, Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive decoding of large language models (LLMs) is memory bandwidth\nbounded, resulting in high latency and significant wastes of the parallel\nprocessing power of modern accelerators. Existing methods for accelerating LLM\ndecoding often require a draft model (e.g., speculative decoding), which is\nnontrivial to obtain and unable to generalize. In this paper, we introduce\nLookahead decoding, an exact, parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates LLM\ndecoding without needing auxiliary models or data stores. It allows trading\nper-step log(FLOPs) to reduce the number of total decoding steps, is more\nparallelizable on single or multiple modern accelerators, and is compatible\nwith concurrent memory-efficient attention (e.g., FlashAttention). Our\nimplementation of Lookahead decoding can speed up autoregressive decoding by up\nto 1.8x on MT-bench and 4x with strong scaling on multiple GPUs in code\ncompletion tasks.

However, the quadratic memory complexity of\nthe self-attention module with respect to the input length hinders their\napplications in long text summarization. Instead of designing more efficient\nattention modules, we approach this problem by investigating if models with a\nrestricted context can have competitive performance compared with the\nmemory-efficient attention models that maintain a global context by treating\nthe input as a single sequence. Our model is applied to individual pages which\ncontain parts of inputs grouped by the principle of locality during both\nencoding and decoding. We empirically investigated three kinds of locality in\ntext summarization at different levels of granularity, ranging from sentences\nto documents. Our experimental results show that our model has a better\nperformance compared with strong baselines with efficient attention modules,\nand our analysis provides further insights into our locality-aware modeling\nstrategy.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-25T03:59:24Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-31T02:14:08Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Adapter Meets Prompt Tuning: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Point Cloud Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Zhikang Zou, Yihan Xu, Xingkui Zhu, Wei Xu, Dingkang Liang, Xin Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Point cloud analysis has achieved outstanding performance by transferring point cloud pre-trained models. However, existing methods for model adaptation usually update all model parameters, i.e., full fine-tuning paradigm, which is inefficient as it relies on high computational costs (e.g., training GPU memory) and massive storage space. In this paper, we aim to study parameter-efficient transfer learning for point cloud analysis with an ideal trade-off between task performance and parameter efficiency. To achieve this goal, we freeze the parameters of the default pre-trained models and then propose the Dynamic Adapter, which generates a dynamic scale for each token, considering the token significance to the downstream task. We further seamlessly integrate Dynamic Adapter with Prompt Tuning (DAPT) by constructing Internal Prompts, capturing the instance-specific features for interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAPT achieves superior performance compared to the full fine-tuning counterparts while significantly reducing the trainable parameters and training GPU memory by 95% and 35%, respectively.

PyTorch FSDP: Experiences on Scaling Fully Sharded Data Parallel\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques*\n\n*Shen Li, Ajit Mathews, Yuchen Hao, Geeta Chauhan, Pritam Damania, Bernard Nguyen, Can Balioglu, Alban Desmaison, Sam Shleifer, Myle Ott, Hamid Shojanazeri, Less Wright, Min Xu, Chien-chin Huang, Liang Luo, Rohan Varma, Andrew Gu, Yanli Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** It is widely acknowledged that large models have the potential to deliver superior performance across a broad range of domains. Despite the remarkable progress made in the field of machine learning systems research, which has enabled the development and exploration of large models, such abilities remain confined to a small group of advanced users and industry leaders, resulting in an implicit technical barrier for the wider community to access and leverage these technologies. In this paper, we introduce PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as an industry-grade solution for large model training. FSDP has been closely co-designed with several key PyTorch core components including Tensor implementation, dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to provide non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency. Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to optimize resource utilization across a variety of hardware configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSDP is capable of achieving comparable performance to Distributed Data Parallel while providing support for significantly larger models with near-linear scalability in terms of TFLOPS.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on memory-efficient attention mechanisms, dynamic parameter adaptation, and hardware-specific optimization techniques, here are some key findings and suggestions from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Block-Attention\nThe \"Block-Attention\" mechanism introduced in the first source is particularly relevant. It divides the input sequence into discrete blocks, each calculating its key-value states independently, except for the final block which attends to all previous blocks. This approach significantly reduces inference latency and computational overhead, making it suitable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios.\n\n### FlashAttention\n\"FlashAttention\" is another efficient attention mechanism that uses tiling and recomputation techniques to reduce memory usage and computational complexity. By processing attention over smaller blocks and avoiding the storage of large intermediate matrices, FlashAttention achieves a significant speedup and memory efficiency.\n\n### Local Attention Mechanism (LAM)\nThe \"Local Attention Mechanism\" (LAM) is designed for time series analysis but can be adapted for other sequential data. LAM exploits the continuity properties of time series to reduce the number of attention scores computed, improving time and memory complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Adaptation\n\n### Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)\nWhile not directly mentioned in the provided sources, the concept of Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) from the analysis note is relevant. SMA enables neural networks to dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements, reducing computation and memory consumption. This dynamic activation can be integrated into attention mechanisms to adapt parameters based on the input sequence[Analysis Note].\n\n### Probabilistic Attention\nThe probabilistic attention mechanism mentioned in the third source involves selecting a subset of queries based on a sparsity measurement, which can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter adaptation. This method reduces the computational cost by focusing only on the most relevant queries.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention is a promising hardware optimization technique. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing power consumption and latency. It involves mapping attention weights to memristor conductance values and performing matrix operations analogously, which can significantly improve efficiency.\n\n### FlashAttention and Hardware Efficiency\nFlashAttention's tiling and recomputation techniques are also beneficial for hardware efficiency. By minimizing memory usage and avoiding the storage of large intermediate matrices, FlashAttention can better utilize the computational resources of modern GPUs, which is crucial for deploying large language models.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Performance Improvements\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nCombining different memory types (eidetic and fading) and implementing dynamic activation mechanisms can enhance the efficiency and performance of language models. Dense connections between layers, as seen in DenseSSM, can also improve information flow while maintaining computational efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Focus on techniques like weight quantization, I/O-aware implementations, and memristor-based acceleration to optimize for hardware constraints.\n- **Efficient State Management**: Use block-based attention, sparse attention, or probabilistic attention to manage state efficiently.\n- **Dynamic Parameter Adaptation**: Implement mechanisms like SMA or probabilistic attention to adapt parameters dynamically based on the input sequence.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage both software and hardware optimizations.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Score: 0.71)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/45 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 31094-31116.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929, 2020.

ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning mechanism*\n\n*Omar Khattab, Matei Zaharia*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is driving fast-paced advances in Information Retrieval (IR), largely owed to fine-tuning deep language models (LMs) for document ranking. While remarkably effective, the ranking models based on these LMs increase computational cost by orders of magnitude over prior approaches, particularly as they must feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network to compute a single relevance score. To tackle this, we present ColBERT, a novel ranking model that adapts deep LMs (in particular, BERT) for efficient retrieval. ColBERT introduces a late interaction architecture that independently encodes the query and the document using BERT and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. By delaying and yet retaining this fine-granular interaction, ColBERT can leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while simultaneously gaining the ability to pre-compute document representations offline, considerably speeding up query processing. Beyond reducing the cost of re-ranking the documents retrieved by a traditional model, ColBERT's pruning-friendly interaction mechanism enables leveraging vector-similarity indexes for end-to-end retrieval directly from a large document collection. We extensively evaluate ColBERT using two recent passage search datasets. Results show that ColBERT's effectiveness is competitive with existing BERT-based models (and outperforms every non-BERT baseline), while executing two orders-of-magnitude faster and requiring four orders-of-magnitude fewer FLOPs per query.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and Parameter-Efficient Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning mechanism*\n\n*Zhihao Jia, Colin Unger, Mengdi Wu, Xinhao Cheng, Gabriele Oliaro, Xupeng Miao*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) is a widely used technique to adapt large language models for different tasks. Service providers typically create separate systems for users to perform PEFT model finetuning and inference tasks. This is because existing systems cannot handle workloads that include a mix of inference and PEFT finetuning requests. As a result, shared GPU resources are underutilized, leading to inefficiencies. To address this problem, we present FlexLLM, the first system that can serve inference and parameter-efficient finetuning requests in the same iteration. Our system leverages the complementary nature of these two tasks and utilizes shared GPU resources to run them jointly, using a method called co-serving. To achieve this, FlexLLM introduces a novel token-level finetuning mechanism, which breaks down the finetuning computation of a sequence into smaller token-level computations and uses dependent parallelization and graph pruning, two static compilation optimizations, to minimize the memory overhead and latency for co-serving. Compared to existing systems, FlexLLM's co-serving approach reduces the activation GPU memory overhead by up to 8x, and the end-to-end GPU memory requirement of finetuning by up to 36% while maintaining a low inference latency and improving finetuning throughput. For example, under a heavy inference workload, FlexLLM can still preserve more than 80% of the peak finetuning throughput, whereas existing systems cannot make any progress with finetuning. The source code of FlexLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/flexflow/FlexFlow.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. TensorFlow Eager: A Multi-Stage, Python-Embedded DSL for Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware specific optimization*\n\n*Asim Shankar, Shanqing Cai, Rajat Monga, Mingsheng Hong, Igor Ganichev, Ashish Agarwal, Alexandre Passos, Akshay Naresh Modi, Josh Levenberg, Allen Lavoie, Akshay Agrawal*\n\n**Abstract:** TensorFlow Eager is a multi-stage, Python-embedded domain-specific language\nfor hardware-accelerated machine learning, suitable for both interactive\nresearch and production. TensorFlow, which TensorFlow Eager extends, requires\nusers to represent computations as dataflow graphs; this permits compiler\noptimizations and simplifies deployment but hinders rapid prototyping and\nrun-time dynamism. TensorFlow Eager eliminates these usability costs without\nsacrificing the benefits furnished by graphs: It provides an imperative\nfront-end to TensorFlow that executes operations immediately and a JIT tracer\nthat translates Python functions composed of TensorFlow operations into\nexecutable dataflow graphs. TensorFlow Eager thus offers a multi-stage\nprogramming model that makes it easy to interpolate between imperative and\nstaged execution in a single package.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware specific optimization*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. Selecting efficient and reliable preservation strategies: modeling long-term information integrity using large-scale hierarchical discrete event simulation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient integration strategy*\n\n*Richard Landau, Micah Altman*\n\n**Abstract:** This article addresses the problem of formulating efficient and reliable operational preservation policies that ensure bit-level information integrity over long periods, and in the presence of a diverse range of real-world technical, legal, organizational, and economic threats. We develop a systematic, quantitative prediction framework that combines formal modeling, discrete-event-based simulation, hierarchical modeling, and then use empirically calibrated sensitivity analysis to identify effective strategies. The framework offers flexibility for the modeling of a wide range of preservation policies and threats. Since this framework is open source and easily deployed in a cloud computing environment, it can be used to produce analysis based on independent estimates of scenario-specific costs, reliability, and risks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. Octopus Inspired Optimization Algorithm: Multi-Level Structures and Parallel Computing Strategies\n\n*From Search Query: efficient integration strategy*\n\n*Rui He, Jia Deng, Xiang Li, Yuhua Dong, Yiquan Wang, Longji Xu, Xu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel bionic intelligent optimisation algorithm, Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO) algorithm, which is inspired by the neural structure of octopus, especially its hierarchical and decentralised interaction properties. By simulating the sensory, decision-making, and executive abilities of octopuses, the OIO algorithm adopts a multi-level hierarchical strategy, including tentacles, suckers, individuals and groups, to achieve an effective combination of global and local search. This hierarchical design not only enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the algorithm, but also significantly improves its search efficiency and adaptability. In performance evaluations, including comparisons with existing mainstream intelligent optimisation algorithms, OIO shows faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially when dealing with multimodal functions and high-dimensional optimisation problems. This advantage is even more pronounced as the required minimum accuracy is higher, with the OIO algorithm showing an average speedup of 2.27 times that of conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and 9.63 times that of differential evolution (DE) on multimodal functions. In particular, when dealing with high-dimensional optimisation problems, OIO achieves an average speed of 10.39 times that of DE, demonstrating its superior computational efficiency. In addition, the OIO algorithm also shows a reduction of about $5\\%$ in CPU usage efficiency compared to PSO, which is reflected in the efficiency of CPU resource usage also shows its efficiency. These features make the OIO algorithm show great potential in complex optimisation problems, and it is especially suitable for application scenarios that require fast, efficient and robust optimisation methods, such as robot path planning, supply chain management optimisation, and energy system management.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on adaptive pruning mechanisms, hardware-specific optimization techniques, and efficient integration strategies, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Adaptive Pruning Mechanisms\n\n### DuoAttention\nThe \"DuoAttention\" mechanism is a promising approach for optimizing long-context inference in LLMs. It categorizes attention heads into \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads,\" allowing for adaptive allocation of memory and computational resources. This approach uses optimization-based identification of retrieval heads and token pruning to reduce memory demands without compromising performance.\n\n### Dynamic Vocabulary Pruning\nDynamic vocabulary pruning, as discussed in the context of early-exit LLMs, involves pruning the vocabulary at test time to reduce the computational cost of confidence estimation. This method maps the hidden representation to the full vocabulary only at initial layers and then prunes the weight matrix based on the most likely tokens, which can be applied to improve efficiency in autoregressive models.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques\n\n### IO-Aware Attention Implementations\nThe \"FlashAttention\" method uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, which is an example of IO-aware attention design. This approach minimizes HBM accesses, making it more efficient for hardware-specific optimizations [Analysis Note].\n\n### Memory Hierarchy-Aware Designs\nEfficient state management and memory hierarchy utilization are crucial. For instance, the \"Break the Sequential Dependency\" approach uses lookahead decoding to trade per-step computational costs for reduced total decoding steps, which is more parallelizable on modern accelerators. This highlights the importance of hardware-aware designs in optimizing LLMs [Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Integration Strategies\n\n### Combining Pruning and Fine-Tuning\nThe \"Tailored LLaMA\" approach demonstrates how to fine-tune pruned LLMs efficiently. It uses structural pruning to reduce model sizes and then applies task-specific fine-tuning with the LoRA method. This approach shows that combining pruning with careful prompt design and fine-tuning can maintain high performance with significantly reduced model sizes.\n\n### Adaptive KV Cache Compression\nDuoAttention's adaptive allocation of KV cache to retrieval and streaming heads is an example of efficient integration. This method balances token pruning between the two types of heads to achieve optimal memory reduction while preserving performance.\n\n### Dynamic Context Pruning and Low-Dimensional Key Representations\nDynamic context pruning and low-dimensional key representations, as mentioned in the analysis note, are techniques that can be integrated to enhance memory efficiency. These methods involve learnable importance estimation and score-based token selection, which can be combined with other optimization techniques to achieve better overall performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Key Insights for Design\n\n- **Memory Management**: Dynamic pruning of context, adaptive compression of KV cache, and low-dimensional key representations are essential for memory efficiency.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: IO-aware implementations, memory hierarchy utilization, and parallel computation strategies are critical for hardware-specific optimizations.\n- **Performance Considerations**: Balancing efficiency and effectiveness, trade-offs between memory and computation, and ensuring hardware awareness are vital for scalable and efficient LLM design.\n- **Integration Strategies**: Combining adaptive pruning mechanisms with fine-tuning, prompt design, and other optimization techniques can lead to highly efficient and effective LLMs.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive LMs that are not only memory-efficient and hardware-aware but also scalable and highly performant.\n",

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

(2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention meta-learning strategies\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Many-Class Few-Shot Learning on Multi-Granularity Class Hierarchy\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Chengqi Zhang, Jing Jiang, Tianyi Zhou, Lu Liu, Guodong Long*\n\n**Abstract:** We study many-class few-shot (MCFS) problem in both supervised learning and meta-learning settings. Compared to the well-studied many-class many-shot and few-class few-shot problems, the MCFS problem commonly occurs in practical applications but has been rarely studied in previous literature. It brings new challenges of distinguishing between many classes given only a few training samples per class. In this paper, we leverage the class hierarchy as a prior knowledge to train a coarse-to-fine classifier that can produce accurate predictions for MCFS problem in both settings. The propose model, \"memory-augmented hierarchical-classification network (MahiNet)\", performs coarse-to-fine classification where each coarse class can cover multiple fine classes. Since it is challenging to directly distinguish a variety of fine classes given few-shot data per class, MahiNet starts from learning a classifier over coarse-classes with more training data whose labels are much cheaper to obtain. The coarse classifier reduces the searching range over the fine classes and thus alleviates the challenges from \"many classes\". On architecture, MahiNet firstly deploys a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features. It then integrates a memory-augmented attention module and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) together to produce the probabilities over coarse and fine classes. While the MLP extends the linear classifier, the attention module extends the KNN classifier, both together targeting the \"few-shot\" problem. We design several training strategies of MahiNet for supervised learning and meta-learning. In addition, we propose two novel benchmark datasets \"mcfsImageNet\" and \"mcfsOmniglot\" specially designed for MCFS problem. In experiments, we show that MahiNet outperforms several state-of-the-art models on MCFS problems in both supervised learning and meta-learning.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neural Interactive Collaborative Filtering\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Long Xia, Yulong Gu, Weidong Liu, Lixin Zou, Xiangyu Zhao, Jimmy Xiangji Huang, Dawei Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we study collaborative filtering in an interactive setting, in which the recommender agents iterate between making recommendations and updating the user profile based on the interactive feedback. The most challenging problem in this scenario is how to suggest items when the user profile has not been well established, i.e., recommend for cold-start users or warm-start users with taste drifting. Existing approaches either rely on overly pessimistic linear exploration strategy or adopt meta-learning based algorithms in a full exploitation way. In this work, to quickly catch up with the user's interests, we propose to represent the exploration policy with a neural network and directly learn it from the feedback data. Specifically, the exploration policy is encoded in the weights of multi-channel stacked self-attention neural networks and trained with efficient Q-learning by maximizing users' overall satisfaction in the recommender systems. The key insight is that the satisfied recommendations triggered by the exploration recommendation can be viewed as the exploration bonus (delayed reward) for its contribution on improving the quality of the user profile. Therefore, the proposed exploration policy, to balance between learning the user profile and making accurate recommendations, can be directly optimized by maximizing users' long-term satisfaction with reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments and analysis conducted on three benchmark collaborative filtering datasets have demonstrated the advantage of our method over state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Delving Deep Into Many-to-Many Attention for Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Shengfeng He, Sucheng Ren, Nanxuan Zhao, Hanjie Wu, Haoxin Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     This paper tackles the task of Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation (FSVOS), i.e., segmenting objects in the query videos with certain class specified in a few labeled support images. The key is to model the relationship between the query videos and the support images for propagating the object information. This is a many-to-many problem and often relies on full-rank attention, which is computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Agent Network (DAN), breaking down the full-rank attention into two smaller ones. We consider one single frame of the query video as the domain agent, bridging between the support images and the query video. Our DAN allows a linear space and time complexity as opposed to the original quadratic form with no loss of performance. In addition, we introduce a learning strategy by combining meta-learning with online learning to further improve the segmentation accuracy. We build a FSVOS benchmark on the Youtube-VIS dataset and conduct experiments to demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines on both computational cost and accuracy, achieving the state-of-the-art performance.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating linear attention and meta-learning strategies, here are some key points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Integration of Linear Attention and Meta-Learning\n\n### Context-Adaptive Encoding\nThe proposal's focus on context-adaptive encoding can be enhanced by integrating it with meta-learning strategies. For instance, **Prototypical Neural Networks (PNNs)**, a type of metric-based meta-learning, can be adapted to learn prototype representations that are context-dependent. This approach can help the model to better generalize across varied contexts by learning to represent classes based on the context provided.\n\n### Optimization-Based Meta-Learning\nTechniques like **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)** can be integrated with linear attention mechanisms to optimize the initialization of model parameters. This allows the model to adapt quickly to new tasks and contexts, which is crucial for autoregressive language models. MAML's ability to learn initialization parameters that are universally good across tasks can be particularly beneficial when combined with linear attention's efficiency.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nStudies such as **Lightning Attention-2** and **Simple Linear Attention Language Models** demonstrate how linear attention can maintain constant training speed across sequence lengths and balance the recall-memory tradeoff. These mechanisms can be integrated with meta-learning to ensure that the model remains efficient and scalable while adapting to new tasks and contexts.\n\n## Robustness and Accuracy\n\n### Empirical Validation\nEmpirical studies on the robustness and accuracy of models using linear attention and meta-learning are crucial. For example, evaluating the performance of models like **AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA)** against existing models using linear attention and speculative decoding techniques can help establish its novelty and effectiveness. This involves comparing the model's performance on diverse input contexts and tasks to ensure it maintains high accuracy and robustness.\n\n## Recent Advancements in Meta-Learning\n\n### In-Context Learning\nResearch on in-context learning, such as the study on **in-context linear learning abilities of deep Transformer models**, highlights the potential of meta-learning in enhancing the adaptability of language models. Integrating such in-context learning capabilities with linear attention can further improve the model's ability to learn from minimal data and adapt to new tasks efficiently.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n### Contextual Position Encoding\n**Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE)** can be integrated with linear attention and meta-learning to condition positions on context, which can improve perplexity and overall performance in language modeling tasks. This approach ensures that the model can dynamically adjust its position encoding based on the context, enhancing its adaptability and efficiency.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nExploring hybrid architectures, such as combining linear attention with other attention mechanisms or state-space models like **MambaFormer**, can provide additional insights into how to optimize the integration of linear attention and meta-learning. Such hybrid models can potentially surpass the performance of individual models in tasks where they struggle independently.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages the efficiency of linear attention, the adaptability of meta-learning, and the robustness of context-adaptive encoding, ultimately achieving better overall performance, scalability, and robustness.\n",

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/25 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nWe also noticed fluctuations in the 5-shot MCQ tasks, with an average MCQ score of around $26.5 \\%$. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention meta-learning\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers learn in-context by gradient descent\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning*\n\n*Max Vladymyrov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Alexander Mordvintsev, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Ettore Randazzo, Eyvind Niklasson, Johannes von Oswald*\n\n**Abstract:** At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.

Interpretable and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning*\n\n*Jian-Xin Li, Quan Wang, Yaming Yang, Jiangtao Cui, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has achieved extraordinary success in learning effective task-specific representations of nodes in graphs. However, regarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN methods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore all possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object, which hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to generate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN) to learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a hierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first, followed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically extract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within a length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce the computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and neighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed ie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its connection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time complexity. Extensive experiments on three real network datasets demonstrate the superiority of ie-HGCN over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. AReLU: Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention meta-learning*\n\n*Jun Li, Kai Xu, Dengsheng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Element-wise activation functions play a critical role in deep neural networks via affecting the expressivity power and the learning dynamics. Learning-based activation functions have recently gained increasing attention and success. We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function through formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network layer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based attention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an element based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear unit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression of negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the resulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU). The attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the activated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity transformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient vanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of relevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that AReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network architectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced. Notably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates, which makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning and meta learning. Our source code has been released (see https://github.com/densechen/AReLU).\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating linear attention and meta-learning, here are some key points and resources that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Traditional attention mechanisms, such as Multi-Head Attention (MHA), have quadratic computational complexity. Linear attention mechanisms aim to reduce this complexity to linear, making them more efficient and scalable.\n  - For example, the concept of linear attention can be understood through the lens of attention mechanisms that avoid the quadratic complexity of traditional attention. This is similar to the ideas presented in the context of transformer models, where linearized attention can be more efficient.\n\n## Integration with Meta-Learning\n\n- Meta-learning techniques, such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), can be integrated to enhance the adaptability and generalization of language models.\n  - MAML and other optimization-based meta-learning methods aim to learn initialization parameters that allow the model to adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal inner steps. This can be particularly beneficial for autoregressive models that need to handle diverse input contexts.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n\n- Context-adaptive encoding involves dynamically adjusting the encoding based on the input context, which can be enhanced through meta-learning strategies.\n  - Papers on in-context learning provide insights into how transformers adapt to different contexts. For instance, \"In-Context Learning with Representations: Contextual Generalization of Trained Transformers\" and \"How Transformers Utilize Multi-Head Attention in In-Context Learning?\" discuss how transformers can generalize and adapt to new contexts, which can be integrated with linear attention mechanisms.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The proposal claims to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear, which is crucial for scalability.\n  - The Movie Gen paper discusses the use of full bi-directional attention and adaptive layer norm blocks, which, although not specifically focused on linear attention, highlight the importance of efficient and scalable design choices in large models. This can serve as a reference for designing scalable architectures.\n\n## Robustness and Accuracy\n\n- The impact on model robustness and accuracy needs to be assessed, particularly in handling varied input contexts.\n  - Research on in-context learning and the role of attention mechanisms in transformers can provide insights into how these models handle varied contexts. For example, \"Why Larger Language Models Do In-context Learning Differently?\" and \"In-Context Learning Creates Task Vectors\" explore the robustness and adaptability of large language models in different contexts.\n\n## Implementation Complexity\n\n- The complexity introduced by integrating linear attention, context-adaptive encoding, and meta-learning needs to be analyzed for practical feasibility.\n  - The integration of multiple advanced techniques can introduce complexity. However, approaches like MAML and other meta-learning techniques are designed to be end-to-end trainable, which can simplify the implementation process despite the added complexity.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Research\n\n- Comparing the proposal with existing models like Infini-attention, Attention Free Transformer (AFT), and Fast Weight Layers (FWLs) is essential.\n  - The \"Awesome Language Model Analysis\" list provides a comprehensive overview of recent research in transformer-based models, including in-context learning and attention mechanisms. This can help in identifying how the proposed AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA) model aligns with or differs from current research trends.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and leveraging the insights from the mentioned resources, the researchers can develop a more efficient, robust, and scalable autoregressive language model that integrates linear attention and meta-learning effectively.\n",

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg.

Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/25 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n# Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important \n\nOlga Golovneva Tianlu Wang Jason Weston Sainbayar Sukhbaatar\n\nFAIR at Meta\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is orderinvariant.\n```\n\n#### 5. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 23  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A hybrid model is introduced, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently, and suggests that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: context-adaptive encoding meta-learning\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Online Invariance Selection for Local Feature Descriptors\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding meta-learning*\n\n*Marc Pollefeys, R\u00e9mi Pautrat, Viktor Larsson, Martin R. Oswald*\n\n**Abstract:** To be invariant, or not to be invariant: that is the question formulated in this work about local descriptors. A limitation of current feature descriptors is the trade-off between generalization and discriminative power: more invariance means less informative descriptors. We propose to overcome this limitation with a disentanglement of invariance in local descriptors and with an online selection of the most appropriate invariance given the context. Our framework consists in a joint learning of multiple local descriptors with different levels of invariance and of meta descriptors encoding the regional variations of an image. The similarity of these meta descriptors across images is used to select the right invariance when matching the local descriptors. Our approach, named Local Invariance Selection at Runtime for Descriptors (LISRD), enables descriptors to adapt to adverse changes in images, while remaining discriminative when invariance is not required. We demonstrate that our method can boost the performance of current descriptors and outperforms state-of-the-art descriptors in several matching tasks, when evaluated on challenging datasets with day-night illumination as well as viewpoint changes.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Few-Shot Representation Learning for Out-Of-Vocabulary Words\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding meta-learning*\n\n*Kai-Wei Chang, Ziniu Hu, Ting Chen, Yizhou Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing approaches for learning word embeddings often assume there are sufficient occurrences for each word in the corpus, such that the representation of words can be accurately estimated from their contexts. However, in real-world scenarios, out-of-vocabulary (a.k.a. OOV) words that do not appear in training corpus emerge frequently. It is challenging to learn accurate representations of these words with only a few observations. In this paper, we formulate the learning of OOV embeddings as a few-shot regression problem, and address it by training a representation function to predict the oracle embedding vector (defined as embedding trained with abundant observations) based on limited observations. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical attention-based architecture to serve as the neural regression function, with which the context information of a word is encoded and aggregated from K observations. Furthermore, our approach can leverage Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) for adapting the learned model to the new corpus fast and robustly. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate embeddings for OOV words, and improves downstream tasks where these embeddings are utilized.\n\n**Conference:** few-shot-representation-learning-for-out-of-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Trajeglish: Traffic Modeling as Next-Token Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding meta-learning*\n\n*Sanja Fidler, Xue Bin Peng, Jonah Philion*\n\n**Abstract:** A longstanding challenge for self-driving development is simulating dynamic driving scenarios seeded from recorded driving logs. In pursuit of this functionality, we apply tools from discrete sequence modeling to model how vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists interact in driving scenarios. Using a simple data-driven tokenization scheme, we discretize trajectories to centimeter-level resolution using a small vocabulary. We then model the multi-agent sequence of discrete motion tokens with a GPT-like encoder-decoder that is autoregressive in time and takes into account intra-timestep interaction between agents. Scenarios sampled from our model exhibit state-of-the-art realism; our model tops the Waymo Sim Agents Benchmark, surpassing prior work along the realism meta metric by 3.3% and along the interaction metric by 9.9%. We ablate our modeling choices in full autonomy and partial autonomy settings, and show that the representations learned by our model can quickly be adapted to improve performance on nuScenes. We additionally evaluate the scalability of our model with respect to parameter count and dataset size, and use density estimates from our model to quantify the saliency of context length and intra-timestep interaction for the traffic modeling task.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using context-adaptive encoding, linear attention, and meta-learning, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Context-Aware Embedding Techniques\n- The use of contextual embedding techniques, such as those involving transformer models like BERT and KERMIT, can enhance the performance of language models by capturing nuanced contextual information.

This can be translated to language models by using similar techniques to adapt to new contexts and tasks.\n\n## Robustness and Accuracy\n- To ensure robustness and accuracy, it is important to integrate attention mechanisms that can effectively handle diverse input contexts.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1.

Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/25 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\n# Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important \n\nOlga Golovneva Tianlu Wang Jason Weston Sainbayar Sukhbaatar\n\nFAIR at Meta\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThe attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is orderinvariant.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 2 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention context-adaptive encoding\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Point-of-Interest Recommendation: Exploiting Self-Attentive Autoencoders with Neighbor-Aware Influence\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Qinglong Wang, Xue Liu, Yingxue Zhang, Chen Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid growth of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) provides a great\nopportunity to satisfy the strong demand for personalized Point-of-Interest\n(POI) recommendation services. However, with the tremendous increase of users\nand POIs, POI recommender systems still face several challenging problems: (1)\nthe hardness of modeling non-linear user-POI interactions from implicit\nfeedback; (2) the difficulty of incorporating context information such as POIs'\ngeographical coordinates. To cope with these challenges, we propose a novel\nautoencoder-based model to learn the non-linear user-POI relations, namely\n\\textit{SAE-NAD}, which consists of a self-attentive encoder (SAE) and a\nneighbor-aware decoder (NAD). In particular, unlike previous works equally\ntreat users' checked-in POIs, our self-attentive encoder adaptively\ndifferentiates the user preference degrees in multiple aspects, by adopting a\nmulti-dimensional attention mechanism. To incorporate the geographical context\ninformation, we propose a neighbor-aware decoder to make users' reachability\nhigher on the similar and nearby neighbors of checked-in POIs, which is\nachieved by the inner product of POI embeddings together with the radial basis\nfunction (RBF) kernel. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on three real-world datasets with many state-of-the-art baseline\nmethods and evaluation metrics.

Neural Image Compression via Non-Local Attention Optimization and Improved Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yao Wang, Xun Cao, Haojie Liu, Tong Chen, Qiu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel Non-Local Attention optmization and Improved Context modeling-based image compression (NLAIC) algorithm, which is built on top of the deep nerual network (DNN)-based variational auto-encoder (VAE) structure. Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using context-adaptive encoding and linear attention integration, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Linear attention mechanisms, such as those described in the context of Lightning Attention-2, offer significant improvements in computational efficiency. These mechanisms maintain constant training speed across sequence lengths, addressing issues with cumulative summation operations. For example, the ALCCA (Adaptive Large Chunk Context Attention) model uses a tree-based structure inspired by the Barnes-Hut algorithm, which combines the benefits of sparse attention with adaptive computation, resulting in sub-quadratic complexity and linear memory usage.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n\n- **Contextualized Representations**: Research on contextualized representations in neural autoregressive language models highlights the importance of capturing long-range contexts. Studies using metrics like Anisotropy-Calibrated Cosine Similarity (ACCS) show that models with better contextualization of long-range content perform better in downstream tasks. This suggests that integrating context-adaptive encoding can enhance the model's ability to handle diverse and long-range contexts.\n\n## Integration with Meta-Learning\n\n- **Meta-Learning Strategies**: Integrating meta-learning with attention mechanisms can enhance the adaptability and efficiency of language models. Training Transformers on autoregressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations, which can be leveraged to improve the model's ability to learn from context and adapt to new tasks.\n\n## Specific Mechanisms and Architectures\n\n- **ALCCA Model**: The ALCCA model, which integrates a novel attention mechanism, is particularly relevant. It uses spatial partitioning of key vectors, adaptive computation based on query-key distances, and GPU-accelerated operations. This approach results in significant computational efficiency gains, making it suitable for processing long sequences efficiently.\n\n## Robustness and Accuracy\n\n- **Contrastive Learning**: Incorporating contrastive learning mechanisms, as seen in the GAAEST framework, can enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model. This involves global feature-based contrastive learning, context feature-based contrastive learning, and local location-based supervised contrastive learning, which help in capturing spatial context information and improving the model's robustness against noise.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Empirical Validation**: Conducting empirical studies to validate the robustness and accuracy of models using linear attention and meta-learning is crucial. This includes comparing the proposed model with existing models like Lightning Attention and speculative decoding techniques to establish its novelty and effectiveness.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Exploring hybrid architectures that combine different attention mechanisms (e.g., linear attention, sparse attention) with meta-learning strategies can provide further improvements in efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researchers can design an autoregressive language model that leverages context-adaptive encoding, linear attention mechanisms, and meta-learning strategies to achieve better efficiency, scalability, robustness, and accuracy.\n",
