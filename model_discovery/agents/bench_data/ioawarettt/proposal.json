FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.78)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 4.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream.

(2016); Hinton \\& Plaut (1987). In the brain, short-term and long-term memory have developed in a specialized way. Short-term memory is allowed to change very quickly to react to immediate sensory inputs and perception. It also tends towards high capacity storage of all pieces of information which may be relevant for future reasoning Jonides et al. (2008); Atkinson \\& Shiffrin (1971); Averbach \\& Coriell (1961). By contrast, long-term memory changes slowly Kolodner (1983); Jeneson \\& Squire (2012), is highly selective and involves repeated consolidation. It contains a set of memories that summarize the entire past, only storing details about observations which are most relevant Goelet et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical memory compression, parallel scan attention, adaptive memory management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. The Kanerva Machine: A Generative Distributed Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Yan Wu, Greg Wayne, Alex Graves, T. Lillicrap*\n\n**TL;DR:** An end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them that significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an end-to-end trained memory system that quickly adapts to new data and generates samples like them. Inspired by Kanerva's sparse distributed memory, it has a robust distributed reading and writing mechanism. The memory is analytically tractable, which enables optimal on-line compression via a Bayesian update-rule. We formulate it as a hierarchical conditional generative model, where memory provides a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Consequently, the top-down memory and bottom-up perception are combined to produce the code representing an observation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the adaptive memory significantly improves generative models trained on both the Omniglot and CIFAR datasets. Compared with the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) and its variants, our memory model has greater capacity and is significantly easier to train.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: parallel scan attention*\n\n*Yifan Peng, Siddharth Dalmia, Ian Lane, Shinji Watanabe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model.\n\n**Abstract:** Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. Scan and Snap: Understanding Training Dynamics and Token Composition in 1-layer Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: parallel scan attention*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Beidi Chen, S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that self-attention acts as adiscriminative scanning algorithm: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has shown impressive performance in multiple research domains and has become the backbone of many neural network models. However, there is limited understanding on how it works. In particular, with a simple predictive loss, how the representation emerges from the gradient \\emph{training dynamics} remains a mystery. In this paper, for 1-layer transformer with one self-attention layer plus one decoder layer, we analyze its SGD training dynamics for the task of next token prediction in a mathematically rigorous manner. We open the black box of the dynamic process of how the self-attention layer combines input tokens, and reveal the nature of underlying inductive bias. More specifically, with the assumption (a) no positional encoding, (b) long input sequence, and (c) the decoder layer learns faster than the self-attention layer, we prove that self-attention acts as a \\emph{discriminative scanning algorithm}: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens. Among distinct tokens, it progressively drops attention weights, following the order of low to high co-occurrence between the key and the query token in the training set. Interestingly, this procedure does not lead to winner-takes-all, but decelerates due to a \\emph{phase transition} that is controllable by the learning rates of the two layers, leaving (almost) fixed token combination. We verify this \\textbf{\\emph{scan and snap}} dynamics on synthetic and real-world data (WikiText).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: parallel scan attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 7. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full).

CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. BAM: Bayes with Adaptive Memory\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management*\n\n*Josue Nassar, Jennifer Brennan, Ben Evans, Kendall Lowrey*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new framework, Bayes with Adaptive Memory (BAM), that takes advantage of past experience by allowing the agent to choose which past observations to remember and which to forget and demonstrates that BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian update rules for non-stationary environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Online learning via Bayes' theorem allows new data to be continuously integrated into an agent's current beliefs. However, a naive application of Bayesian methods in non stationary environments leads to slow adaptation and results in state estimates that may converge confidently to the wrong parameter value. A common solution when learning in changing environments is to discard/downweight past data; however, this simple mechanism of\"forgetting\"fails to account for the fact that many real-world environments involve revisiting similar states. We propose a new framework, Bayes with Adaptive Memory (BAM), that takes advantage of past experience by allowing the agent to choose which past observations to remember and which to forget. We demonstrate that BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian update rules for non-stationary environments. Through a variety of experiments, we demonstrate the ability of BAM to continuously adapt in an ever-changing world.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Residual Dense Network for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Yu Kong, Yulun Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Bineng Zhong, Yun Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural network has recently achieved great success for image restoration (IR) and also offered hierarchical features. However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning for Video Compression with Hierarchical Quality and Recurrent Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory compression*\n\n*Luc van Gool, Radu Timofte, Ren Yang, Fabian Mentzer*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Learned Video Compression (HLVC) method with three hierarchical quality layers and a recurrent enhancement network. The frames in the first layer are compressed by an image compression method with the highest quality. Using these frames as references, we propose the Bi-Directional Deep Compression (BDDC) network to compress the second layer with relatively high quality. Then, the third layer frames are compressed with the lowest quality, by the proposed Single Motion Deep Compression (SMDC) network, which adopts a single motion map to estimate the motions of multiple frames, thus saving bits for motion information. In our deep decoder, we develop the Weighted Recurrent Quality Enhancement (WRQE) network, which takes both compressed frames and the bit stream as inputs. In the recurrent cell of WRQE, the memory and update signal are weighted by quality features to reasonably leverage multi-frame information for enhancement. In our HLVC approach, the hierarchical quality benefits the coding efficiency, since the high quality information facilitates the compression and enhancement of low quality frames at encoder and decoder sides, respectively. Finally, the experiments validate that our HLVC approach advances the state-of-the-art of deep video compression methods, and outperforms the \"Low-Delay P (LDP) very fast\" mode of x265 in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM.

Attention as an RNN\n\n*From Search Query: parallel scan attention*\n\n*Greg Mori, Yoshua Bengio, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Frederick Tung, Leo Feng*\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring (Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-09\n\n\n\n#### 5. QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Ari Holtzman, Artidoro Pagnoni, Tim Dettmers*\n\n**Abstract:** We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. S-LoRA: Serving Thousands of Concurrent LoRA Adapters\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive memory management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Kurt Keutzer, Lianmin Zheng, Banghua Zhu, Christopher Chou, Shuo Yang, Nicholas Lee, Coleman Hooper, Dacheng Li, Shiyi Cao, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"pretrain-then-finetune\" paradigm is commonly adopted in the deployment of large language models. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is often employed to adapt a base model to a multitude of tasks, resulting in a substantial collection of LoRA adapters derived from one base model. We observe that this paradigm presents significant opportunities for batched inference during serving. To capitalize on these opportunities, we present S-LoRA, a system designed for the scalable serving of many LoRA adapters. S-LoRA stores all adapters in the main memory and fetches the adapters used by the currently running queries to the GPU memory. To efficiently use the GPU memory and reduce fragmentation, S-LoRA proposes Unified Paging. Unified Paging uses a unified memory pool to manage dynamic adapter weights with different ranks and KV cache tensors with varying sequence lengths. Additionally, S-LoRA employs a novel tensor parallelism strategy and highly optimized custom CUDA kernels for heterogeneous batching of LoRA computation. Collectively, these features enable S-LoRA to serve thousands of LoRA adapters on a single GPU or across multiple GPUs with a small overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art libraries such as HuggingFace PEFT and vLLM (with naive support of LoRA serving), S-LoRA can improve the throughput by up to 4 times and increase the number of served adapters by several orders of magnitude. As a result, S-LoRA enables scalable serving of many task-specific fine-tuned models and offers the potential for large-scale customized fine-tuning services.

For instance, the multi-level memory hierarchy in GPUs (global memory, shared memory, registers, and caches) can inspire a similar hierarchical structure for neural network memory management. This approach can help in optimizing memory access and reducing redundancy.\n\n### Efficient Compression Techniques\nModel quantization is a promising approach for reducing memory footprint while maintaining performance. Techniques such as ultra-low bit quantization with arbitrary precision, as described in the paper on efficient arbitrary precision acceleration for large language models, can be applied. This involves using a novel bipolar-INT data format, matrix decomposition, and reassembly to reduce data redundancy and optimize memory usage.\n\n### Pruning and Sparse Models\nPruning techniques, such as those described in the lottery ticket hypothesis and SynFlow, can be used to reduce the memory footprint of neural networks. These methods prune weights and connections to maintain only the most important parameters, thereby reducing memory consumption without significantly impacting performance.\n\n## Combining Recurrent Processing with Parallel Operations\n\n### Staircase Attention\nStaircase attention mechanisms offer a way to combine recurrent processing with parallel training capabilities. This approach involves breaking down the sequence into backward and forward tokens, allowing for efficient sequential processing while maintaining parallel training efficiency - This is aligned with the insights from \"Staircase Attention\" and can be integrated into the model design.\n\n### Parallel Scan Operations\nThe Simplified State Space Layers (S5) approach leverages multi-input, multi-output state space models that can perform efficient parallel scans. This technique can be integrated to enhance the computational efficiency of the model while handling long sequences.\n\n### Adaptive Memory Management\nAdaptive memory management can be achieved by combining hierarchical memory structures with explicit state tracking mechanisms outside of traditional state-space models. This could involve using different levels of memory for different timescales, ensuring that the model can efficiently handle both short-term and long-term dependencies. The use of adaptive attention spans can also help in focusing on the most relevant context, thereby optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\n## Architectural Integration\n\n### Integrating Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nTo maintain test-time training capabilities and ensure computational efficiency, the model can integrate hierarchical attention mechanisms. This involves using a combination of recurrent processing for sequential handling and parallel scan operations for computational efficiency. The hierarchical attention can be designed to adaptively focus on different parts of the sequence based on relevance, similar to the staircase attention mechanism.\n\n### Ensuring Model Expressiveness\nTo preserve model expressiveness, the integration should carefully balance the use of hierarchical memory structures, compression techniques, and parallel operations. This can involve using sparse autoencoders or other compression methods that maintain the accuracy and interpretability of the model, as suggested by the information-theoretic framework for interpreting SAEs.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that efficiently manages memory, handles long sequences, and maintains high performance and expressiveness.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.58)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Dynamic Model Pruning with Feedback\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory allocation neural networks*\n\n*Tao Lin, Sebastian U. Stich, Luis Barba, D. Dmitriev, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model compression method is proposed that generates a sparse trained model without additional overhead by allowing dynamic allocation of the sparsity pattern and incorporating feedback signal to reactivate prematurely pruned weights to obtain a performant sparse model in one single training pass.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks often have millions of parameters. This can hinder their deployment to low-end devices, not only due to high memory requirements but also because of increased latency at inference. We propose a novel model compression method that generates a sparse trained model without additional overhead: by allowing (i) dynamic allocation of the sparsity pattern and (ii) incorporating feedback signal to reactivate prematurely pruned weights we obtain a performant sparse model in one single training pass (retraining is not needed, but can further improve the performance). We evaluate the method on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and show that the obtained sparse models can reach the state-of-the-art performance of dense models and further that their performance surpasses all previously proposed pruning schemes (that come without feedback mechanisms).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 182  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 2. PRES: Toward Scalable Memory-Based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory allocation neural networks*\n\n*Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Chuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned Finite State Machines\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory allocation neural networks*\n\n*Siyuan Chen, Pratik Fegade, Tianqi Chen, Phillip B. Gibbons, T. Mowry*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning and finds that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads.\n\n**Abstract:** Batching has a fundamental influence on the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) execution. However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. Further, batching puts strict restrictions on memory adjacency and can lead to high data movement costs. In this paper, we provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads, which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x, 1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU and GPU.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 8. CO2: Efficient Distributed Training with Full Communication-Computation Overlap\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Weixuan Sun, Shidi Li, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation and provides a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound.\n\n**Abstract:** The fundamental success of large language models hinges upon the efficacious implementation of large-scale distributed training techniques. Nevertheless, building a vast, high-performance cluster featuring high-speed communication interconnectivity is prohibitively costly, and accessible only to prominent entities. In this work, we aim to lower this barrier and democratize large-scale training with limited bandwidth clusters. We propose a new approach called CO2 that introduces local-updating and asynchronous communication to the distributed data-parallel training, thereby facilitating the full overlap of COmunication with COmputation. CO2 is able to attain a high scalability even on extensive multi-node clusters constrained by very limited communication bandwidth. We further propose the staleness gap penalty and outer momentum clipping techniques together with CO2 to bolster its convergence and training stability. Besides, CO2 exhibits seamless integration with well-established ZeRO-series optimizers which mitigate memory consumption of model states with large model training. We also provide a mathematical proof of convergence, accompanied by the establishment of a stringent upper bound. Furthermore, we validate our findings through an extensive set of practical experiments encompassing a wide range of tasks in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing. These experiments serve to demonstrate the capabilities of CO2 in terms of convergence, generalization, and scalability when deployed across configurations comprising up to 128 A100 GPUs. The outcomes emphasize the outstanding capacity of CO2 to hugely improve scalability, no matter on clusters with 800Gbps RDMA or 80Gbps TCP/IP inter-node connections.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9.

Existing implementations aim to learn efficiently by running multiple threads in parallel while operating on a single model in shared memory, ignoring incidental memory update collisions.

Instance-Aware Dynamic Neural Network Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory allocation neural networks*\n\n*Wen Gao, Siwei Ma, Kai Han, Yunhe Wang, Zhenhua Liu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Quantization is an effective way to reduce the memory and computational costs of deep neural networks in which the full-precision weights and activations are represented using low-bit values. The bit-width for each layer in most of existing quantization methods is static, i.e., the same for all samples in the given dataset. However, natural images are of huge diversity with abundant content and using such a universal quantization configuration for all samples is not an optimal strategy. In this paper, we present to conduct the low-bit quantization for each image individually, and develop a dynamic quantization scheme for exploring their optimal bit-widths. To this end, a lightweight bit-controller is established and trained jointly with the given neural network to be quantized. During inference, the quantization configuration for an arbitrary image will be determined by the bit-widths generated by the controller, e.g., an image with simple texture will be allocated with lower bits and computational complexity and vice versa. Experimental results conducted on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic quantization method for achieving state-of-art performance in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.

CHEX: CHannel EXploration for CNN Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory allocation neural networks*\n\n*Sun-Yuan Kung, Yuan Xie, Rong Jin, Yen-Kuang Chen, Yi Xu, Kun Yuan, Xiaolong Ma, Fei Sun, Minghai Qin, Zejiang Hou*\n\n**Abstract:** Channel pruning has been broadly recognized as an effective technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of deep convolutional neural networks. However, conventional pruning methods have limitations in that: they are restricted to pruning process only, and they require a fully pre-trained large model. Such limitations may lead to sub-optimal model quality as well as excessive memory and training cost. In this paper, we propose a novel Channel Exploration methodology, dubbed as CHEX, to rectify these problems. As opposed to pruning-only strategy, we propose to repeatedly prune and regrow the channels throughout the training process, which reduces the risk of pruning important channels prematurely. More exactly: From intra-layer's aspect, we tackle the channel pruning problem via a well known column subset selection (CSS) formulation. From inter-layer's aspect, our regrowing stages open a path for dynamically re-allocating the number of channels across all the layers under a global channel sparsity constraint. In addition, all the exploration process is done in a single training from scratch without the need of a pre-trained large model. Experimental results demonstrate that CHEX can effectively reduce the FLOPs of diverse CNN architectures on a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and 3D vision. For example, our compressed ResNet-50 model on ImageNet dataset achieves 76% top1 accuracy with only 25% FLOPs of the original ResNet-50 model, outperforming previous state-of-the-art channel pruning methods. The checkpoints and code are available at here .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Joint Autoregressive and Hierarchical Priors for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state compression*\n\n*Johannes Ball\u00e9, David Minnen, George Toderici*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders,\nlearning approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent\nrepresentation. These are combined with an entropy model, a prior on the latent\nrepresentation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to\nyield a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models have been\nintroduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than simple fully\nfactorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining\nend-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in\nprobabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, as\nwell as combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in\nthe context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive\nmodels come with a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of\ncompression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are\ncomplementary and, together, exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents\nbetter than all previous learned models. The combined model yields\nstate-of-the-art rate--distortion performance, providing a 15.8% average\nreduction in file size over the previous state-of-the-art method based on deep\nlearning, which corresponds to a 59.8% size reduction over JPEG, more than 35%\nreduction compared to WebP and JPEG2000, and bitstreams 8.4% smaller than BPG,\nthe current state-of-the-art image codec. To the best of our knowledge, our\nmodel is the first learning-based method to outperform BPG on both PSNR and\nMS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Conference:** joint-autoregressive-and-hierarchical-priors-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. Attention as an RNN\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Greg Mori, Yoshua Bengio, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Frederick Tung, Leo Feng*\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 6. Parallel Index-Based Structural Graph Clustering and Its Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** SCAN (Structural Clustering Algorithm for Networks) is a well-studied, widely used graph clustering algorithm. For large graphs, however, sequential SCAN variants are prohibitively slow, and parallel SCAN variants do not effectively share work among queries with different SCAN parameter settings. Since users of SCAN often explore many parameter settings to find good clusterings, it is worthwhile to precompute an index that speeds up queries. This paper presents a practical and provably efficient parallel index-based SCAN algorithm based on GS*-Index, a recent sequential algorithm. Our parallel algorithm improves upon the asymptotic work of the sequential algorithm by using integer sorting. It is also highly parallel, achieving logarithmic span (parallel time) for both index construction and clustering queries. Furthermore, we apply locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to design a novel approximate SCAN algorithm and prove guarantees for its clustering behavior. We present an experimental evaluation of our algorithms on large real-world graphs. On a 48-core machine with two-way hyper-threading, our parallel index construction achieves 50--151$\\times$ speedup over the construction of GS*-Index. In fact, even on a single thread, our index construction algorithm is faster than GS*-Index. Our parallel index query implementation achieves 5--32$\\times$ speedup over GS*-Index queries across a range of SCAN parameter values, and our implementation is always faster than ppSCAN, a state-of-the-art parallel SCAN algorithm. Moreover, our experiments show that applying LSH results in faster index construction while maintaining good clustering quality.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on dynamic memory allocation, hierarchical state compression, and efficient parallel scan implementations, here are some key techniques and insights from the available sources and related research:\n\n## Dynamic Memory Allocation in Neural Networks\n\n### Reinforcement Learning for Memory Management\nUsing reinforcement learning (RL) to manage dynamic memory allocation can be highly effective. A framework where an RL agent learns from interactions with the system to optimize memory management tactics has shown promising results. This approach can adapt to changing conditions and avoid fragmentation, outperforming traditional algorithms like first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimization\nTechniques like FlashAttention, which is IO-aware and uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between different memory hierarchies (e.g., GPU HBM and SRAM), can be adapted for dynamic memory allocation in neural networks. This approach optimizes memory access patterns, reducing the overhead of memory operations{Analysis}.\n\n## Hierarchical State Compression\n\n### Hierarchical Conditional Generative Models\nThe Kanerva Machine provides a hierarchical conditional generative model that enables optimal online compression via a Bayesian update rule. This model organizes memory in a hierarchical manner, providing a rich data-dependent prior distribution. Adapting such hierarchical compression techniques can help in managing and compressing the state of neural networks efficiently{Analysis}.\n\n### Video Compression Analogies\nTechniques from video compression, which often use hierarchical compression methods, can be adapted for state management in neural networks. This involves compressing states at different levels of granularity, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of model states{Analysis}.\n\n## Efficient Parallel Scan Implementations\n\n### Parallel Branch Architectures\nBranchformer's parallel MLP-attention architecture can be a model for efficient parallel processing. By using one branch for self-attention to capture long-range dependencies and another branch for an MLP module with convolutional gating to extract local relationships, this architecture can handle different types of dependencies efficiently. This parallel branch approach can be applied to state processing and scan operations in autoregressive models{Analysis}.\n\n### Gated Linear Attention\nGated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers offer efficient parallel training while maintaining linear-time inference. This architecture is particularly effective for length generalization and can be integrated into autoregressive models to enhance parallel scan operations and state processing efficiency{Analysis}.\n\n### Memory-Augmented Neural Networks\nMemory-Augmented Neural Networks (MANNs) such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) and Differentiable Neural Computers (DNCs) incorporate external memory components for dynamic operations. These networks can be optimized for parallel scan operations by leveraging their ability to store and recall memories efficiently, which is crucial for handling sequential data in autoregressive models.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nTechniques like sparse attention mechanisms can extend the context length without significantly increasing computational costs. This is particularly useful for maintaining long-term dependencies in autoregressive models, allowing for more efficient parallel scan implementations.\n\n### Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows models to access information beyond their training data, enhancing their knowledge base. This can be integrated with hierarchical state compression and dynamic memory allocation to improve the overall efficiency and performance of autoregressive models.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory management, state compression, and parallel processing, ultimately leading to better scalability and performance.\n",

Parallel Branch Architecture\nFrom Branchformer:\n\"In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships.\"\n\nThis parallel branch approach could be adapted to handle different types of dependencies more efficiently.\n\n4. Gated Linear Attention\nFrom GLA paper:\n\"The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer...

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing (Avg. Score: 0.33)\n\n*Zihang Dai, Guokun Lai, Yiming Yang, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 199  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Funnel-Transformer, a model which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost and outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: neural architecture optimization memory efficiency, adaptive online compression techniques, hardware-aware neural network design\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. ZARTS: On Zero-order Optimization for Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Xiaoxing Wang, Wenxuan Guo, Junchi Yan, Jianlin Su, Xiaokang Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without enforcing the above approximation, and three representative zero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which MGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) has been a popular one-shot paradigm for NAS due to its high efficiency. It introduces trainable architecture parameters to represent the importance of candidate operations and proposes first/second-order approximation to estimate their gradients, making it possible to solve NAS by gradient descent algorithm. However, our in-depth empirical results show that the approximation will often distort the loss landscape, leading to the biased objective to optimize and in turn inaccurate gradient estimation for architecture parameters. This work turns to zero-order optimization and proposes a novel NAS scheme, called ZARTS, to search without enforcing the above approximation. Specifically, three representative zero-order optimization methods are introduced: RS, MGS, and GLD, among which MGS performs best by balancing the accuracy and speed. Moreover, we explore the connections between RS/MGS and gradient descent algorithm and show that our ZARTS can be seen as a robust gradient-free counterpart to DARTS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and search spaces show the remarkable performance of our method. In particular, results on 12 benchmarks verify the outstanding robustness of ZARTS, where the performance of DARTS collapses due to its known instability issue. Also, we search on the search space of DARTS to compare with peer methods, and our discovered architecture achieves 97.54% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 75.7% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which are state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Improving Differentiable Neural Architecture Search by Encouraging Transferability\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Parth Sheth, P. Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** A transferability-encouraging tri-level optimization framework which improves the architecture of a main model by encouraging good transferability to an auxiliary model and a new knowledge transfer approach based on matching quadruple relative similarities is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable neural architecture search methods are increasingly popular due to their computational efficiency. However, these methods have unsatisfactory generalizability and stability. Their searched architectures are often degenerate with a dominant number of skip connections and perform unsatisfactorily on test data. Existing methods for solving this problem have a variety of limitations, such as cannot prevent the happening of architecture degeneration, being excessively restrictive in setting the number of skip connections, etc. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach for improving the generalizability and stability of differentiable NAS, by developing a transferability-encouraging tri-level optimization framework which improves the architecture of a main model by encouraging good transferability to an auxiliary model. Our framework involves three stages performed end-to-end: 1) train network weights of a main model; 2) transfer knowledge from the main model to an auxiliary model; 3) optimize the architecture of the main model by maximizing its transferability to the auxiliary model. We propose a new knowledge transfer approach based on matching quadruple relative similarities. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Meta Neural Heuristic for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zizhen Zhang, Zhiguang Cao, Te Ye, Siyuan Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems, which is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural heuristics based on deep reinforcement learning have exhibited promise in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). However, they are still struggling to achieve high learning efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems. Specifically, for the training process, a (partial) architecture-shared multi-task model is leveraged to achieve parallel learning for the meta-model, so as to speed up the training; meanwhile, a scaled symmetric sampling method with respect to the weight vectors is designed to stabilize the training. For the fine-tuning process, an efficient hierarchical method is proposed to systematically tackle all the subproblems. Experimental results on the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) show that, EMNH is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency, and yield competitive solutions to the strong traditional heuristics while consuming much shorter time.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Improved Online Conformal Prediction via Strongly Adaptive Online Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive online compression techniques*\n\n*Aadyot Bhatnagar, Haiquan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Yu Bai*\n\n**TL;DR:** New online conformal prediction methods are developed that minimize the strongly adaptive regret, which measures the worst-case regret over all intervals of a fixed length, and it is proved that these methods consistently obtain better coverage and smaller prediction sets than existing methods on real-world tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of uncertainty quantification via prediction sets, in an online setting where the data distribution may vary arbitrarily over time. Recent work develops online conformal prediction techniques that leverage regret minimization algorithms from the online learning literature to learn prediction sets with approximately valid coverage and small regret. However, standard regret minimization could be insufficient for handling changing environments, where performance guarantees may be desired not only over the full time horizon but also in all (sub-)intervals of time. We develop new online conformal prediction methods that minimize the strongly adaptive regret, which measures the worst-case regret over all intervals of a fixed length. We prove that our methods achieve near-optimal strongly adaptive regret for all interval lengths simultaneously, and approximately valid coverage. Experiments show that our methods consistently obtain better coverage and smaller prediction sets than existing methods on real-world tasks, such as time series forecasting and image classification under distribution shift.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Online Learned Continual Compression with Adaptive Quantization Modules\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive online compression techniques*\n\n*Lucas Caccia, Eugene Belilovsky, Massimo Caccia, Joelle Pineau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning and shows that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce and study the problem of Online Continual Compression, where one attempts to simultaneously learn to compress and store a representative dataset from a non i.i.d data stream, while only observing each sample once. A naive application of auto-encoders in this setting encounters a major challenge: representations derived from earlier encoder states must be usable by later decoder states. We show how to use discrete auto-encoders to effectively address this challenge and introduce Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) to control variation in the compression ability of the module at any given stage of learning. This enables selecting an appropriate compression for incoming samples, while taking into account overall memory constraints and current progress of the learned compression. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not require any pretraining, even on challenging datasets. We show that using AQM to replace standard episodic memory in continual learning settings leads to significant gains on continual learning benchmarks. Furthermore we demonstrate this approach with larger images, LiDAR, and reinforcement learning environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Adaptive Online Packing-guided Search for POMDPs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive online compression techniques*\n\n*Chenyang Wu, Guoyu Yang, Zongzhang Zhang, Yang Yu, Dong Li, Wulong Liu, Jianye Hao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an online planning algorithm, Adaptive Online Packing-guided Search (AdaOPS), to better approximate beliefs with adaptive particle technique and balance estimation bias and variance by fusing similar observation branches.\n\n**Abstract:** The partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) provides a general framework for modeling an agent\u2019s decision process with state uncertainty, and online planning plays a pivotal role in solving it. A belief is a distribution of states representing state uncertainty. Methods for large-scale POMDP problems rely on the same idea of sampling both states and observations. That is, instead of exact belief updating, a collection of sampled states is used to approximate the belief; instead of considering all possible observations, only a set of sampled observations are considered. Inspired by this, we take one step further and propose an online planning algorithm, Adaptive Online Packing-guided Search (AdaOPS), to better approximate beliefs with adaptive particle \ufb01lter technique and balance estimation bias and variance by fusing similar observation branches. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to \ufb01nd an (cid:15) -optimal policy with a high probability given enough planning time under some mild assumptions. We evaluate our algorithm on several tricky POMDP domains, and it outperforms the state-of-the-art in all of them.

Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

Lane*\n\n**TL;DR:** BRP-NAS is proposed, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN) that outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS- Bench-201 and DARTS.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) enables researchers to automatically explore broad design spaces in order to improve efficiency of neural networks. This efficiency is especially important in the case of on-device deployment, where improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data selection strategy. We show that our proposed method outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. Finally, to raise awareness of the fact that accurate latency estimation is not a trivial task, we release LatBench -- a latency dataset of NAS-Bench-201 models running on a broad range of devices.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 183  (*Influential: 35*)\n\n#### 9.

Mullins*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows, for the first time, how to rapidly adapt model architectures to new tasks in a many-task many-hardware few-shot learning setup by integrating Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) into the NAS flow.\n\n**Abstract:** Network Architecture Search (NAS) methods have recently gathered much attention. They design networks with better performance and use a much shorter search time compared to traditional manual tuning. Despite their efficiency in model deployments, most NAS algorithms target a single task on a fixed hardware system. However, real-life few-shot learning environments often cover a great number of tasks (T ) and deployments on a wide variety of hardware platforms (H ). The combinatorial search complexity T times H creates a fundamental search efficiency challenge if one naively applies existing NAS methods to these scenarios. To overcome this issue, we show, for the first time, how to rapidly adapt model architectures to new tasks in a many-task many-hardware few-shot learning setup by integrating Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) into the NAS flow. The proposed NAS method (H-Meta-NAS) is hardware-aware and performs optimisation in the MAML framework. H-Meta-NAS shows a Pareto dominance compared to a variety of NAS and manual baselines in popular few-shot learning benchmarks with various hardware platforms and constraints. In particular, on the 5-way 1-shot Mini-ImageNet classification task, the proposed method outperforms the best manual baseline by a large margin (5.21% in accuracy) using 60% less computation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

NAS-FCOS: Fast Neural Architecture Search for Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Ning Wang, Yanning Zhang, Yang Gao, Chunhua Shen, Zhi Tian, Peng Wang, Hao Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of deep neural networks relies on significant architecture engineering. Recently neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promise to greatly reduce manual effort in network design by automatically searching for optimal architectures, although typically such algorithms need an excessive amount of computational resources, e.g., a few thousand GPU-days. To date, on challenging vision tasks such as object detection, NAS, especially fast versions of NAS, is less studied. Here we propose to search for the decoder structure of object detectors with search efficiency being taken into consideration. To be more specific, we aim to efficiently search for the feature pyramid network (FPN) as well as the prediction head of a simple anchor-free object detector, namely FCOS, using a tailored reinforcement learning paradigm. With carefully designed search space, search algorithms and strategies for evaluating network quality, we are able to efficiently search a top-performing detection architecture within 4 days using 8 V100 GPUs. The discovered architecture surpasses state-of-the-art object detection models (such as Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet and FCOS) by 1.5 to 3.5 points in AP on the COCO dataset, with comparable computation complexity and memory footprint, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed NAS for object detection.\n\n**Conference:** nas-fcos-fast-neural-architecture-search-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Deep Interest Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive online compression techniques*\n\n*Yanghui Yan, Ying Fan, Kun Gai, Junqi Jin, Chengru Song, Xiaoqiang Zhu, Han Zhu, Han Li, Xiao Ma, Guorui Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Click-through rate prediction is an essential task in industrial\napplications, such as online advertising. Recently deep learning based models\nhave been proposed, which follow a similar Embedding\\&MLP paradigm. In these\nmethods large scale sparse input features are first mapped into low dimensional\nembedding vectors, and then transformed into fixed-length vectors in a\ngroup-wise manner, finally concatenated together to fed into a multilayer\nperceptron (MLP) to learn the nonlinear relations among features. In this way,\nuser features are compressed into a fixed-length representation vector, in\nregardless of what candidate ads are. The use of fixed-length vector will be a\nbottleneck, which brings difficulty for Embedding\\&MLP methods to capture\nuser's diverse interests effectively from rich historical behaviors. In this\npaper, we propose a novel model: Deep Interest Network (DIN) which tackles this\nchallenge by designing a local activation unit to adaptively learn the\nrepresentation of user interests from historical behaviors with respect to a\ncertain ad. This representation vector varies over different ads, improving the\nexpressive ability of model greatly. Besides, we develop two techniques:\nmini-batch aware regularization and data adaptive activation function which can\nhelp training industrial deep networks with hundreds of millions of parameters.\nExperiments on two public datasets as well as an Alibaba real production\ndataset with over 2 billion samples demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed\napproaches, which achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art\nmethods.

PromptMM: Multi-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Recommendation with Prompt-Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive online compression techniques*\n\n*Chao Huang, Lianghao Xia, Yangqin Jiang, Jiabin Tang, Wei Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimedia online platforms (e.g., Amazon, TikTok) have greatly benefited from the incorporation of multimedia (e.g., visual, textual, and acoustic) content into their personal recommender systems. These modalities provide intuitive semantics that facilitate modality-aware user preference modeling. However, two key challenges in multi-modal recommenders remain unresolved: i) The introduction of multi-modal encoders with a large number of additional parameters causes overfitting, given high-dimensional multi-modal features provided by extractors (e.g., ViT, BERT). ii) Side information inevitably introduces inaccuracies and redundancies, which skew the modality-interaction dependency from reflecting true user preference. To tackle these problems, we propose to simplify and empower recommenders through Multi-modal Knowledge Distillation (PromptMM) with the prompt-tuning that enables adaptive quality distillation. Specifically, PromptMM conducts model compression through distilling u-i edge relationship and multi-modal node content from cumbersome teachers to relieve students from the additional feature reduction parameters. To bridge the semantic gap between multi-modal context and collaborative signals for empowering the overfitting teacher, soft prompt-tuning is introduced to perform student task-adaptive. Additionally, to adjust the impact of inaccuracies in multimedia data, a disentangled multi-modal list-wise distillation is developed with modality-aware re-weighting mechanism. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate PromptMM's superiority over existing techniques. Ablation tests confirm the effectiveness of key components. Additional tests show the efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Flops or parameters are traditional metrics to evaluate the efficiency of networks which are not sensitive to hardware including computing ability and memory bandwidth. Thus, how to design a neural network to efficiently use the computing ability and memory bandwidth of hardware is a critical problem. This paper proposes a method how to design hardware-aware neural network. Based on this method, we designed EfficientRep series convolutional networks, which are high-computation hardware(e.g. GPU) friendly and applied in YOLOv6 object detection framework.

SqueezeNext: Hardware-Aware Neural Network Design\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware neural network design*\n\n*Amir Gholami, Xiangyu Yue, Peter Jin, Bichen Wu, Zizheng Tai, Kurt Keutzer, Sicheng Zhao, Kiseok Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the main barriers for deploying neural networks on embedded systems\nhas been large memory and power consumption of existing neural networks. In\nthis work, we introduce SqueezeNext, a new family of neural network\narchitectures whose design was guided by considering previous architectures\nsuch as SqueezeNet, as well as by simulation results on a neural network\naccelerator. This new network is able to match AlexNet's accuracy on the\nImageNet benchmark with $112\\times$ fewer parameters, and one of its deeper\nvariants is able to achieve VGG-19 accuracy with only 4.4 Million parameters,\n($31\\times$ smaller than VGG-19). SqueezeNext also achieves better top-5\nclassification accuracy with $1.3\\times$ fewer parameters as compared to\nMobileNet, but avoids using depthwise-separable convolutions that are\ninefficient on some mobile processor platforms. This wide range of accuracy\ngives the user the ability to make speed-accuracy tradeoffs, depending on the\navailable resources on the target hardware. Using hardware simulation results\nfor power and inference speed on an embedded system has guided us to design\nvariations of the baseline model that are $2.59\\times$/$8.26\\times$ faster and\n$2.25\\times$/$7.5\\times$ more energy efficient as compared to\nSqueezeNet/AlexNet without any accuracy degradation.\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on neural architecture optimization, memory efficiency, and hardware-aware design, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Optimization\n\n### Data Pipeline Optimization\nOptimizing the data pipeline can significantly reduce memory usage and improve execution efficiency. Techniques such as **caching frequently used data** and **data augmentation at runtime** can help. Caching reduces access times, while data augmentation applies transformations on the fly, reducing storage needs and enriching the dataset.\n\n### Memory Allocation and Reuse\nEfficient memory management is crucial. **Reusing memory blocks** instead of creating new allocations during each iteration can prevent memory fragmentation, which improves execution speed. This is particularly important in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) where sequences of data are processed.\n\n### Gradient Checkpointing\n**Gradient checkpointing** strategically saves intermediate layers during the forward pass, allowing for the recalculation of only essential layers during the backward pass. This reduces memory usage, which is beneficial for training large models with limited memory, especially in transformer-based models.\n\n## Adaptive Online Compression Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Quantization\nDynamic quantization schemes can adapt the bit-widths of model parameters based on input characteristics. For example, **instance-aware dynamic neural network quantization** conducts low-bit quantization for each input individually, exploring optimal bit-widths dynamically.\n\n### Hierarchical Compression\nHierarchical approaches, such as those used in video compression, can be applied to neural networks. **HiNeRV** combines lightweight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings, offering higher performance and flexibility. Similar hierarchical conditional generative models like the Kanerva Machine can enable optimal online compression.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Neural Network Design\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms\n**FlashAttention** is an example of an IO-aware algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between different levels of memory hierarchy (e.g., GPU HBM and SRAM). This approach can significantly optimize memory access patterns.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Architectures\nDesigning architectures that maximize data reuse and minimize memory access is critical. For instance, the architecture proposed in the paper on memory-efficient high-performance DNN accelerators uses flexible internal memory, programmable data control, and a memory-allocation algorithm to maximize performance and efficiency.\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can be highly efficient for transformer networks. The proposed memristor design for softmax calculations reduces write energy and enhances overall efficiency, making it suitable for dynamic requirements.\n\n## Parallel Processing and Efficiency\n\n### Gated Linear Attention\n**Gated Linear Attention Transformers** enable efficient parallel training while maintaining linear inference. This architecture is particularly effective for length generalization, allowing models to handle long sequences without significant perplexity degradation.\n\n### Branchformer Architecture\nThe **Branchformer** architecture suggests ways to handle different dependency types in parallel, which can be optimized for hardware efficiency. This involves specialized architectures that can efficiently process various types of dependencies.\n\n## Neural Architecture Search (NAS)\n\n### Automated Architecture Optimization\n**Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** can automate the process of finding the optimal model architecture, balancing performance and speed. NAS identifies efficient architectures that optimize both accuracy and speed, tailored to the specific hardware available. This is particularly beneficial for mobile and edge AI applications where computation resources are limited.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly efficient in terms of memory usage, adaptive to different inputs, and optimized for hardware performance. This approach ensures that the models can scale better with more data and larger architectures while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations.

We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/21 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nTianqi Chen, Bing Xu, Chiyuan Zhang, and Carlos Guestrin. 2016.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Exploring the Limits of Differentially Private Deep Learning with Group-wise Clipping\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization deep learning*\n\n*Jiyan He, Xuechen Li, Da Yu, Huishuai Zhang, Janardhan Kulkarni, Y. Lee, A. Backurs, Nenghai Yu, J. Bian*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that per-layer clipping, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization, which results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially private deep learning has recently witnessed advances in computational efficiency and privacy-utility trade-off. We explore whether further improvements along the two axes are possible and provide affirmative answers leveraging two instantiations of \\emph{group-wise clipping}. To reduce the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \\emph{per-layer clipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given training epoch constraints, hence attaining similar or better task performance within less wall time. To explore the limits of scaling (pretrained) models in differentially private deep learning, we privately fine-tune the 175 billion-parameter GPT-3. We bypass scaling challenges associated with clipping gradients that are distributed across multiple devices with \\emph{per-device clipping} that clips the gradient of each model piece separately on its host device. Privately fine-tuning GPT-3 with per-device clipping achieves a task performance at $\\epsilon=1$ better than what is attainable by non-privately fine-tuning the largest GPT-2 on a summarization task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. MODeL: Memory Optimizations for Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization deep learning*\n\n*Benoit Steiner, Mostafa Elhoushi, Jacob Kahn, James Hegarty*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents MODeL, an algorithm that optimizes the lifetime and memory location of the tensors used to train neural networks, and presents several techniques to simplify the encoding of the problem, and enables the approach to scale to the size of state-of- the-art neural networks using an off-the-shelf ILP solver.\n\n**Abstract:** The size of deep neural networks has grown exponentially in recent years. Unfortunately, hardware devices have not kept pace with the rapidly increasing memory requirements. To cope with this, researchers have proposed various techniques including spilling, recomputation, reduced precision training, model pruning, and so on. However, these approaches suffer from various limitations: they can increase training time, affect model accuracy, or require extensive manual modifications to the neural networks. We present MODeL , an algorithm that optimizes the lifetime and memory location of the tensors used to train neural networks. Our method automatically reduces the memory usage of existing neural networks without any of the drawbacks of other techniques. We formulate the problem as a joint integer linear program (ILP). We present several techniques to simplify the encoding of the problem, and enable our approach to scale to the size of state-of-the-art neural networks using an off-the-shelf ILP solver. We experimentally demonstrate that MODeL only takes seconds to allow the training of neural networks using 30% less memory on average.

MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization deep learning*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result. Our study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 123  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 4. An Adaptive Empirical Bayesian Method for Sparse Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Wei Deng, Xiao Zhang, F.

The proposed method works by alternatively sampling from an adaptive hierarchical posterior distribution using stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and smoothly optimizing the hyperparameters using stochastic approximation (SA). We further prove the convergence of the proposed method to the asymptotically correct distribution under mild conditions. Empirical applications of the proposed method lead to the state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and Fashion MNIST with shallow convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the state-of-the-art compression performance on CIFAR10 with Residual Networks. The proposed method also improves resistance to adversarial attacks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. SLAMB: Accelerated Large Batch Training with Sparse Communication\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Hang Xu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiawei Fei, Yuzhe Wu, Tingwen Xie, Jun Huang, Yuchen Xie, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Panos Kalnis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper combines sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB) to propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed training of large deep neural networks requires frequent exchange of massive data be-tween machines, thus communication efficiency is a major concern. Existing compressed communication methods are either not compatible with large batch optimization algorithms, or do not provide sufficient speedup in large scale. In this paper, we combine sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB). We propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs. SLAMB employs momentum masking, local error compensation, and element-wise adaptive rescaling to achieve accurate layer-wise weight updates, which translates to fast convergence for very large batches. Our empirical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, SLAMB transmits half the amount of data in large-batch BERT pre-training, without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, SLAMB achieves excellent scalability in large computing infrastructures. For instance, SLAMB with 128 GPUs reduces the training time of Swin Transformer pre-training on ImageNet to 5.35 hours, which is 2 hours faster than the state-of-the-art. At the extreme, we trained BERT-XL (2.8B parameters) on 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, where SLAMB achieved 90% scaling efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Ziming Wang, Runhao Jiang, S. Lian, Rui Yan, Huajin Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise, in this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is pro-hibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation degree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7.

By leveraging JAX's auto-vectorization and parallelization over accelerators, Pgx can efficiently scale to thousands of simultaneous simulations over accelerators. In our experiments on a DGX-A100 workstation, we discovered that Pgx can simulate RL environments 10-100x faster than existing implementations available in Python. Pgx includes RL environments commonly used as benchmarks in RL research, such as backgammon, chess, shogi, and Go. Additionally, Pgx offers miniature game sets and baseline models to facilitate rapid research cycles. We demonstrate the efficient training of the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm with Pgx environments. Overall, Pgx provides high-performance environment simulators for researchers to accelerate their RL experiments.

Differentiable Expected Hypervolume Improvement for Parallel Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient parallel processing*\n\n*Sam Daulton, Maximilian Balandat, E. Bakshy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work derives a novel formulation of Expected Hypervolume Improvement, an acquisition function that extends EHVI to the parallel, constrained evaluation setting and demonstrates that it is computationally tractable in many practical scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective BO algorithms at a fraction of their wall time.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, decision makers seek to efficiently optimize multiple competing objectives in a sample-efficient fashion. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) is a common approach, but many existing acquisition functions do not have known analytic gradients and suffer from high computational overhead. We leverage recent advances in programming models and hardware acceleration for multi-objective BO using Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI)---an algorithm notorious for its high computational complexity. We derive a novel formulation of $q$-Expected Hypervolume Improvement ($q$EHVI), an acquisition function that extends EHVI to the parallel, constrained evaluation setting. $q$EHVI is an exact computation of the joint EHVI of $q$ new candidate points (up to Monte-Carlo (MC) integration error). Whereas previous EHVI formulations rely on gradient-free acquisition optimization or approximated gradients, we compute exact gradients of the MC estimator via auto-differentiation, thereby enabling efficient and effective optimization using first-order and quasi-second-order methods. Lastly, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that $q$EHVI is computationally tractable in many practical scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective BO algorithms at a fraction of their wall time.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 207  (*Influential: 27*)\n\n#### 9. Block-Recurrent Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient parallel processing*\n\n*DeLesley S. Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code. Our code has been released as open source.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 79  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Allo: A Programming Model for Composable Accelerator Design\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization deep learning*\n\n*Zhiru Zhang, Mengjia Dai, Zhichen Zeng, Shaojie Xiang, Niansong Zhang, Hongzheng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Special-purpose hardware accelerators are increasingly pivotal for sustaining performance improvements in emerging applications, especially as the benefits of technology scaling continue to diminish. However, designers currently lack effective tools and methodologies to construct complex, high-performance accelerator architectures in a productive manner. Existing high-level synthesis (HLS) tools often require intrusive source-level changes to attain satisfactory quality of results. Despite the introduction of several new accelerator design languages (ADLs) aiming to enhance or replace HLS, their advantages are more evident in relatively simple applications with a single kernel. Existing ADLs prove less effective for realistic hierarchical designs with multiple kernels, even if the design hierarchy is flattened. In this paper, we introduce Allo, a composable programming model for efficient spatial accelerator design. Allo decouples hardware customizations, including compute, memory, communication, and data type from algorithm specification, and encapsulates them as a set of customization primitives. Allo preserves the hierarchical structure of an input program by combining customizations from different functions in a bottom-up, type-safe manner. This approach facilitates holistic optimizations that span across function boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used HLS benchmarks and several realistic deep learning models. Our evaluation shows that Allo can outperform state-of-the-art HLS tools and ADLs on all test cases in the PolyBench. For the GPT2 model, the inference latency of the Allo generated accelerator is 1.7x faster than the NVIDIA A100 GPU with 5.4x higher energy efficiency, demonstrating the capability of Allo to handle large-scale designs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. AutoDNNchip: An Automated DNN Chip Predictor and Builder for Both FPGAs and ASICs\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization deep learning*\n\n*Yue Wang, Zetong Guan, Yongan Zhang, Yingyan Lin, Deming Chen, Cong Hao, Xiaofan Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Chaojian Li, Yang Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have fueled a growing demand for DNN chips. However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1) mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large design space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is needed to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition, which would require different hardware IPs to meet the application specifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset. Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip Predictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration, technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP selection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design via the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC). Furthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art accelerators.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-06\n\n\n\n#### 3.

How Well Do Sparse Imagenet Models Transfer?\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression neural networks*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Mark Kurtz, Alexandra Peste, Eugenia Iofinova*\n\n**Abstract:** Transfer learning is a classic paradigm by which models pretrained on large \"upstream\" datasets are adapted to yield good results on \"downstream\" specialized datasets. Generally, more accurate models on the \"upstream\" dataset tend to provide better transfer accuracy \"downstream\". In this work, we perform an in-depth investigation of this phenomenon in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on the ImageNet dataset, which have been pruned - that is, compressed by sparsifying their connections. We consider transfer using unstructured pruned models obtained by applying several state-of-the-art pruning methods, including magnitude-based, second-order, re-growth, lottery-ticket, and regularization approaches, in the context of twelve standard transfer tasks. In a nutshell, our study shows that sparse models can match or even outperform the transfer performance of dense models, even at high sparsities, and, while doing so, can lead to significant inference and even training speedups. At the same time, we observe and analyze significant differences in the behaviour of different pruning methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-26\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures.

Nebula-I: A General Framework for Collaboratively Training Deep Learning Models on Low-Bandwidth Cloud Clusters\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient parallel processing*\n\n*dianhai yu, Yanjun Ma, Yu Sun, Ge Li, Yue Yu, Yaqian Han, Shaohuai Shi, Bin Wang, Long Li, Yongshuai Hou, Peng Liu, Shuohuan Wang, Yuang Liu, Xianjie Mo, Siyu Ding, Weibao Gong, Zhihua Wu, Yang Xiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The ever-growing model size and scale of compute have attracted increasing interests in training deep learning models over multiple nodes. However, when it comes to training on cloud clusters, especially across remote clusters, huge challenges are faced. In this work, we introduce a general framework, Nebula-I, for collaboratively training deep learning models over remote heterogeneous clusters, the connections between which are low-bandwidth wide area networks (WANs). We took natural language processing (NLP) as an example to show how Nebula-I works in different training phases that include: a) pre-training a multilingual language model using two remote clusters; and b) fine-tuning a machine translation model using knowledge distilled from pre-trained models, which run through the most popular paradigm of recent deep learning. To balance the accuracy and communication efficiency, in Nebula-I, parameter-efficient training strategies, hybrid parallel computing methods and adaptive communication acceleration techniques are jointly applied. Meanwhile, security strategies are employed to guarantee the safety, reliability and privacy in intra-cluster computation and inter-cluster communication. Nebula-I is implemented with the PaddlePaddle deep learning framework, which can support collaborative training over heterogeneous hardware, e.g. GPU and NPU. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework could substantially maximize the training efficiency while preserving satisfactory NLP performance. By using Nebula-I, users can run large-scale training tasks over cloud clusters with minimum developments, and the utility of existed large pre-trained models could be further promoted. We also introduced new state-of-the-art results on cross-lingual natural language inference tasks, which are generated based upon a novel learning framework and Nebula-I.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on memory hierarchy optimization, adaptive state compression, and hardware-efficient parallel processing, here are some specific techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization\n\n### Tiling and Caching Strategies\n- Techniques like those used in FlashAttention can be highly effective. FlashAttention employs tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between different levels of memory (e.g., GPU high bandwidth memory and GPU on-chip SRAM), which can significantly reduce memory access overhead[3,.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Organization\n- Organizing memory hierarchically, similar to the concept described in memory hierarchies, can help optimize data access and storage. This involves ensuring frequently used data is readily available in faster memory levels, while less frequently accessed data is stored in larger, slower memory spaces.\n\n## Adaptive State Compression\n\n### Dynamic Quantization\n- Adaptive Quantization Modules (AQM) can dynamically adjust the bit-widths of model states based on content importance, enabling efficient compression while maintaining model quality. This approach is highlighted in Online Learned Continual Compression, where AQM controls the variation in compression ability at different stages of learning[3,.\n\n### Hierarchical Compression\n- Hierarchical compression approaches, such as those suggested by the concept of MemTree, can organize memory hierarchically with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content and semantic embeddings. This allows for dynamic adaptation of the memory structure to enrich the model's context-awareness and handle complex reasoning more effectively.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Parallel Processing\n\n### Maximizing Data Reuse\n- Designing architectures that maximize data reuse and minimize memory access is crucial. This can be achieved by optimizing the computation graph of neural networks, as demonstrated by AutoGO, which evolves neural networks in a low-level computation graph to improve performance and hardware friendliness[3,.\n\n### Parallel Processing Capabilities\n- Efficient parallel processing can be implemented through careful architecture design. For example, using techniques that allow for the parallelization of operations across multiple devices, and optimizing data movement between these devices to reduce memory load and improve convergence speed[3,.\n\n### Specialized Hardware Optimizations\n- Utilizing specialized hardware optimizations, such as those that leverage the memory hierarchy effectively, can significantly improve performance. For instance, optimizing for specific hardware capabilities like GPU architectures and leveraging caching strategies can enhance the efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Memory-Aware Algorithms\n- Algorithms like HiBO, which use hierarchical Bayesian optimization, can be adapted to optimize the search space in model training. While HiBO is primarily used for optimization tasks, its concept of adaptive search space partitioning can be applied to optimize memory usage and data movement in deep learning models.\n\n### Efficient Optimizers\n- Using efficient optimizers that reduce memory load and improve convergence speed is also important. Optimizers like Shampoo and Adagrad, which store preconditioners at varying levels of granularity, can help in this regard by reducing the extra memory burden associated with traditional optimizers like Adam.\n\nBy combining these techniques\u2014tiling and caching for memory access optimization, dynamic and hierarchical compression for state representation, and hardware-efficient parallel processing architectures\u2014the researcher can significantly enhance the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 2. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

Score: 0.10)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization compression*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary.

Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Hosting these models at scale requires significant memory resources. One crucial memory bottleneck for the deployment stems from the context window. It is commonly recognized that model weights are memory hungry; however, the size of key-value embedding stored during the generation process (KV cache) can easily surpass the model size. The enormous size of the KV cache puts constraints on the inference batch size, which is crucial for high throughput inference workload. Inspired by an interesting observation of the attention scores, we hypothesize the persistence of importance: only pivotal tokens, which had a substantial influence at one step, will significantly influence future generations. Based on our empirical verification and theoretical analysis around this hypothesis, we propose Scissorhands, a system that maintains the memory usage of the KV cache at a fixed budget without finetuning the model. In essence, Scissorhands manages the KV cache by storing the pivotal tokens with a higher probability. We validate that Scissorhands reduces the inference memory usage of the KV cache by up to 5X without compromising model quality. We further demonstrate that Scissorhands can be combined with 4-bit quantization, traditionally used to compress model weights, to achieve up to 20X compression.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 110  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4.

To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

CAFE: Towards Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding for Large-scale Recommendation Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization compression*\n\n*Bin Cui, Tong Yang, Tong Zhao, Yikai Zhao, Boxuan Chen, Zirui Liu, Hailin Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the growing memory demands of embedding tables in Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) pose great challenges for model training and deployment. Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously meet three key design requirements: memory efficiency, low latency, and adaptability to dynamic data distribution. This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements. The design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources to important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to unimportant ones. In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data structure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot features in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique embedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one embedding by using hash embedding technique. Guided by our design philosophy, we further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the embedding tables of non-hot features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of HotSketch, and analyze the model convergence against deviation. Extensive experiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding compression methods, yielding 3.92% and 3.68% superior testing AUC on Criteo Kaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x. The source codes of CAFE are available at GitHub.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on test-time training integration with memory optimization, compression methods for state management, hardware-specific implementation details for attention mechanisms, and the impact of compression on model adaptability and performance, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Test-Time Training Integration with Memory Optimization\n\n- The paper on \"Compressing Optimizer states and Activation for Memory-Efficient FP8 Training\" introduces COAT, a framework that significantly reduces the memory footprint during training by quantizing optimizer states and activations into FP8. This approach can be adapted for test-time training by applying similar quantization techniques to reduce memory usage, thereby enabling more efficient test-time training.\n\n- The use of activation checkpointing and ZeroOffload/CPUAdam, as discussed in the context of protein language models, can also be applied to autoregressive language models. These techniques reduce memory usage by recalculating intermediate states and offloading optimization states to CPU memory, which can be beneficial during test-time training.\n\n## Compression Methods for State Management\n\n- COAT introduces Dynamic Range Expansion and Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization, which are effective in compressing optimizer states and activations. These methods can be applied to state management in language models to reduce memory footprint while maintaining performance.\n\n- Hierarchical compression techniques, such as those mentioned in the analysis note, can be used for efficient state management. For example, hierarchical approaches to memory organization and dynamic compression techniques can help in managing the state of large language models efficiently.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Implementation Details for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The \"FlashAttention\" algorithm is highlighted for its IO-aware exact attention mechanism that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach can be particularly beneficial for optimizing attention mechanisms in autoregressive language models.\n\n- The use of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and memory tiering, as discussed in the context of overcoming memory bottlenecks, can significantly enhance the performance of attention mechanisms. HBM provides higher bandwidth, and memory tiering can optimize memory access patterns.\n\n- Memristor-based in-memory computing, as described in the Nature article, offers an efficient hardware accelerator for transformer networks. This approach can be explored for hardware-specific implementation of attention mechanisms, potentially reducing power consumption and latency.\n\n## Impact of Compression on Model Adaptability and Performance\n\n- The COAT framework demonstrates that quantizing optimizer states and activations into FP8 can reduce the memory footprint by 1.54\u00d7 compared to BF16 while achieving nearly lossless performance. This suggests that compression techniques can be applied without significant degradation in model performance.\n\n- The use of quantization techniques, such as those discussed in the context of protein language models, shows that rounding model weights to lower-precision numbers can significantly reduce memory usage without compromising performance. This indicates that compression can enhance model adaptability and efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n\n- The analysis note emphasizes the importance of tiling strategies, matrix decomposition, and kernel fusion in reducing memory overhead and improving hardware utilization. These techniques, when combined with compression methods, can ensure that the model remains adaptable and performs well even with reduced memory footprint.\n\nBy integrating these findings, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more memory-efficient, scalable, and adaptable, while maintaining high performance.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/49 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:22795-22807, 2021.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention memory optimization*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention memory optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention memory optimization*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. FlashMask: Efficient and Rich Mask Extension of FlashAttention\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention memory optimization*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, dianhai yu, Jiang Bian, Zeyu Chen, Lujing Zheng, Jiabin Yang, Siming Wu, Xiyuan Xiao, Jinle Zeng, Guoxia Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational and memory demands of vanilla attention scale quadratically with the sequence length $N$, posing significant challenges for processing long sequences in Transformer models. FlashAttention alleviates these challenges by eliminating the $O(N^2)$ memory dependency and reducing attention latency through IO-aware memory optimizations. However, its native support for certain attention mask types is limited, and it does not inherently accommodate more complex masking requirements. Previous approaches resort to using dense masks with $O(N^2)$ memory complexity, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose FlashMask, an extension of FlashAttention that introduces a column-wise sparse representation of attention masks. This approach efficiently represents a wide range of mask types and facilitates the development of optimized kernel implementations. By adopting this novel representation, FlashMask achieves linear memory complexity $O(N)$, suitable for modeling long-context sequences. Moreover, this representation enables kernel optimizations that eliminate unnecessary computations by leveraging sparsity in the attention mask, without sacrificing computational accuracy, resulting in higher computational efficiency. We evaluate FlashMask's performance in fine-tuning and alignment training of LLMs such as SFT, LoRA, DPO, and RM. FlashMask achieves significant throughput improvements, with end-to-end speedups ranging from 1.65x to 3.22x compared to existing FlashAttention dense method. Additionally, our kernel-level comparisons demonstrate that FlashMask surpasses the latest counterpart, FlexAttention, by 12.1% to 60.7% in terms of kernel TFLOPs/s, achieving 37.8% to 62.3% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on the A100 GPU. The code is open-sourced on PaddlePaddle and integrated into PaddleNLP, supporting models with over 100 billion parameters for contexts up to 128K tokens.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware attention memory optimization*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Dylan Zinsley, Silas Alberti, Aman Timalsina, Michael Zhang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Simran Arora*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

DeFT uses \"deferred flash attention\" to manage memory efficiently during tree-based LLM inference, achieving significant speedups while maintaining model performance.\n\n- **FlashAttention** is another IO-aware self-attention algorithm that optimizes memory usage and runtime for long sequences by minimizing read/write operations between different memory types (e.g., HBM and SRAM). This approach fuses operations to reduce memory overhead, demonstrating performance gains on NVIDIA A100 GPUs.\n\n## Hierarchical Compression Methods for Language Model States\n\n- **Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)** propose a learned network for memory management that improves both performance and efficiency of transformers. NAMMs evolve to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads, allowing for substantial reductions in the number of retained tokens in the KV cache. This approach is universally applicable to any transformer-based architecture and shows performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks.\n\n- While not specifically focused on hierarchical compression, the concept of **dynamic compression based on content importance** is implicit in NAMMs, as they condition on features constructed from the attention matrix to selectively retain the most relevant information.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Attention Computation\n\n- **DeFT** also addresses hardware optimization by leveraging tree-search techniques and IO-awareness to reduce the computational cost and memory usage of tree-based LLM inference. This approach results in significant speedups (up to 3.5x) compared to previous attention mechanisms and improves GPU utilization.\n\n- **FlashAttention** optimizes memory usage and runtime by minimizing read/write operations and fusing operations, which is particularly beneficial for hardware efficiency on GPUs like the NVIDIA A100.\n\n## Integration of Tiling and Compression in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The **DeFT** paper integrates tiling strategies with attention mechanisms by organizing the model's knowledge in a tree-like structure. This allows for efficient searching during inference and reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention calculation through KV-Guided Grouping. This method avoids repeatedly loading KV cache of shared prefixes, thus optimizing memory efficiency and hardware utilization.\n\n- **FlashAttention** and similar IO-aware algorithms can be integrated with tiling strategies to further optimize memory management. For example, FlashAttention's approach to minimizing read/write operations can be combined with tiling to reduce memory overhead and improve runtime efficiency.\n\nThese findings and references provide a solid foundation for improving autoregressive language model design by optimizing IO-aware memory management, implementing hierarchical compression methods, and integrating hardware optimization strategies with tiling and compression techniques.\n",

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/30 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

We note that biological agents have no option but to operate inductively, due to (a) hard memory bounds, and (b) evolutionary pressure towards minimizing inference latency: When faced with a threat, a biological agent is better served by a quick suboptimal decision than by reasoning over all past experience. AI built on silicon has no such limitations: Memory can grow unbounded and test-time computation can be distributed and improved by hardware design. Nonetheless, any practical realization involves some kind of constraint on inference time or compute resources. Therefore, resource-constrained optimal inference hinges on how to best use the available resources against a growing memory. Example A. 2 (CNN Classifiers, VAEs and GANs). A trained representation can be co-opted to generate data. For example, a CNN can be used to classify random data until one is labeled with the desired class, and the resulting sample considered as being \"generated\" by the CNN. Similarly, one could generate random data indirectly by feeding noise to an encoder, as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), again co-opting a representation for generating data. In a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), data is generated by perturbing the latent representation of a map trained to re-construct the dataset. Example A. 3 (Diffusion Models). Diffusion Models are representations, trained to re-construct the original data, but the mechanics used to reconstruct the data during training are sequential, using an artificial \"time\" variable, akin to a realization. This makes their use as \"generative representation\" natural since the reconstruction process is already a stochastic realization $8^{8}$\nExample A.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Z.

In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/36 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09431, 2023.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization FastTTTLinear*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Test-time Training for Matching-based Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization FastTTTLinear*\n\n*Juliette Bertrand, Giorgos Kordopatis-Zilos, Yannis Kalantidis, Giorgos Tolias*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer and explores test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS.\n\n**Abstract:** The video object segmentation (VOS) task involves the segmentation of an object over time based on a single initial mask. Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

AdaNPC: Exploring Non-Parametric Classifier for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization FastTTTLinear*\n\n*Yi-Fan Zhang, Xue Wang, Kexin Jin, Kun Yuan, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tien-Ping Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work adopts Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC), and builds a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains that can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent machine learning tasks focus to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

Leveraging Proxy of Training Data for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training memory optimization FastTTTLinear*\n\n*Juwon Kang, Nayeong Kim, Donghyeon Kwon, Jungseul Ok, Suha Kwak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them, which enables virtually supervised test-time training and outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disre-gard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals and the specific details needed for improving autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on test-time training, memory optimization, and hardware efficiency, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Test-Time Training Compatibility with Memory Optimization Techniques\n\nThe concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, as discussed in the papers, integrates self-supervised learning to update the hidden state of the model during test sequences. This approach is promising for reducing perplexity and improving performance in long contexts.\n\n- **TTT Layers**: The papers introduce TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP layers, which have linear complexity and expressive hidden states. These layers update the hidden state through self-supervised learning, which can be compatible with memory optimization techniques. For instance, the use of mini-batches and a duo-form for operations in TTT layers can significantly improve training speed on modern hardware, indicating potential for integration with memory-efficient methods.\n\n## Dynamic Compression Methods in Adaptive Models\n\nDynamic compression is crucial for optimizing memory usage, especially in models with large parameters.\n\n- **FlashAttention and Partition-Attention**: These methods optimize memory usage by minimizing read/write operations and using attention masks to handle variable-length sequences efficiently. While these methods are primarily discussed in the context of protein language models, their principles can be adapted to other autoregressive models. The use of tiling strategies and attention masks can be integrated with test-time training to optimize memory usage.\n\n## Integration of Tiling Strategies with Adaptive Computation\n\nTiling strategies are effective in reducing memory overhead and improving computational efficiency.\n\n- **FlashAttention**: This algorithm uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU HBM and SRAM, which can be applied to test-time training to optimize memory usage. The integration of such tiling strategies with TTT layers could enhance their efficiency in handling long contexts.\n\n## Hardware Optimization for Test-Time Training\n\nHardware optimization is essential for efficient training and inference of large models.\n\n- **Activation Checkpointing and ZeroOffload/CPUAdam**: These techniques reduce memory usage during training by recalculating intermediate states and offloading optimization states to CPU memory. These methods can be applied to test-time training to optimize hardware usage. For example, activation checkpointing can lower GPU memory usage, and ZeroOffload/CPUAdam can save significant memory, making large model training more feasible.\n\n## Specific Considerations for FastTTTLinear\n\nFor FastTTTLinear, the following considerations are important:\n\n- **Preliminary Systems Optimization**: FastTTTLinear has shown to be faster than the Transformer at 8K context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time with preliminary systems optimization. This suggests that further optimization, including the use of tiling strategies and dynamic compression, could enhance its performance and efficiency.\n\n- **Memory I/O Challenges**: While FastTTTLinear is efficient, TTT-MLP faces challenges with memory I/O. Addressing these challenges through techniques like FlashAttention, Partition-Attention, and activation checkpointing could improve the overall efficiency of FastTTTLinear.\n\nIn summary, integrating test-time training with memory optimization techniques such as FlashAttention, Partition-Attention, and dynamic compression methods can significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models like FastTTTLinear. Hardware-specific optimizations, including activation checkpointing and ZeroOffload/CPUAdam, are also crucial for efficient training and inference.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

ABC: Attention with Bounded-memory Control\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Hao Peng, Jungo Kasai, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Zhaofeng Wu, Lingpeng Kong, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster.

Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization attention mechanisms memory efficiency*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Yu Qiao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP.

Techniques like cache tiling, kernel fusion, and loop unrolling can significantly improve performance. For instance, the IREE compiler optimizes matrix multiplication by improving data locality and maximizing computational throughput through register tiling and cache tiling.\n\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: An efficient hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing can accelerate the transformer self-attention mechanism. This approach reduces the need for data movement between memory and processing units, enhancing efficiency and performance.\n\n- **GPU Optimizations**: Optimizations using CUDA and specialized libraries can target maximizing the utilization of GPU resources. Techniques such as SIMT (single-instruction multiple threads) and the use of streaming multiprocessors (SMs) can make computations faster on existing hardware.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks for IO-Aware Implementations\n\n- **Performance Profiling**: Studies have shown that matrix multiplication operations consume over 95% of the inference time in transformer-based models. Optimizations using IREE can reduce the inference time significantly, for example, from several hours to about 5 seconds for generating a single token on a 32.5 MHz FPGA.\n\n- **Comparison with Existing Implementations**: Comparisons between optimized implementations (like IREE) and other solutions (such as llama.cpp) highlight the performance gains. IREE outperforms other solutions by reducing the required engineering effort and achieving better performance through graph-level optimizations.\n\n## Integration Methods for Compression and Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- **Dynamic Compression and Test-Time Training**: Techniques like dynamic memory compression can be integrated with test-time training. This involves retrofitting LLMs for accelerated inference and adapting the model on retrieved data at test time, which can be compatible with memory optimization techniques[Analysis Note: Human-like Episodic Memory, Loki paper].\n\n- **Model Pruning and Quantization**: Strategies such as model pruning, quantization, and model distillation can reduce the model size and computational requirements without significantly compromising accuracy. These techniques can be combined with test-time adaptation to enhance model efficiency and adaptability.\n\n## Impact of Memory Optimization on Model Quality and Performance\n\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Efficient memory access through tiling strategies can improve performance without compromising model quality. This approach ensures that data remains in the cache hierarchy for as long as possible, reducing memory latency and improving the performance of matrix multiplication operations.\n\n- **Compression and Model Performance**: Balancing the compression ratio with model performance is crucial. Techniques like low-rank keys for efficient sparse attention can maintain model performance while reducing memory requirements[Analysis Note: Loki paper].\n\n- **Attention Mechanism Improvements**: Improvements in attention mechanisms, such as the Differential Transformer, which cancels out noise and amplifies relevant attention, can enhance model performance and robustness without significant additional computational overhead. This approach maintains efficiency through parallelization and optimization techniques.\n\nBy integrating these hardware-specific optimizations, efficient memory management techniques, and test-time adaptation strategies, researchers can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and robustness of autoregressive language models.\n",
