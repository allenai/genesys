    "review": "## Comprehensive Analysis of the LosslessCompressedTTTLinear Proposal\n\n### 1. **Clarity**\n\nThe **LosslessCompressedTTTLinear** proposal is well-articulated with clearly defined objectives. It aims to enhance the existing **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating lossless key-value (KV) cache compression, hierarchical memory organization, and dynamic parameter adaptation. The proposal effectively outlines the motivation, problem analysis, core ideas, and detailed design modifications, including pseudocode implementations for the proposed components such as the **LosslessCompressor**, **HierarchicalMemory**, and **DynamicAdapter**. This level of detail facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the proposed enhancements and their intended impact on the model's performance and efficiency.\n\n### 2. **Innovation**\n\nThe proposal introduces several innovative elements:\n\n- **Lossless KV Cache Compression:** Building upon the recent **LoMA** paper, the proposal emphasizes lossless compression of the KV cache, ensuring that no critical information is lost during the compression process. This approach differentiates it from other compression methods that may incur information loss.\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Organization:** By implementing a multi-level memory structure, the proposal enables the model to capture multi-scale dependencies more effectively. This hierarchical approach allows for efficient information storage and retrieval, enhancing the model's ability to handle long sequences.\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Adaptation:** Introducing a dynamic adapter that modifies model parameters based on sequence characteristics aligns with adaptive computation trends. This ensures that computational resources are optimally allocated, maintaining model expressiveness while enhancing efficiency.\n\n- **Integration Without Compromising Test-Time Training:** The proposal adeptly maintains test-time training capabilities despite the integration of compression and hierarchical structures, addressing a critical challenge in model adaptability during inference.\n\nWhile these elements are individually explored in existing research, the **LosslessCompressedTTTLinear** proposal's combination of lossless compression, hierarchical memory, and dynamic adaptation presents a unique and valuable integration, potentially offering superior efficiency and scalability without compromising performance.\n\n### 3. **Feasibility**\n\nThe proposed design appears feasible within the current framework:\n\n- **Modular Integration:** The proposal leverages modular components such as the **LosslessCompressor**, **HierarchicalMemory**, and **DynamicAdapter**, which can be independently developed and tested before integration into the **FastTTTLinear** GAU.\n\n- **Alignment with Existing Methodologies:** The incorporation of methods inspired by the **LoMA** paper and other sibling proposals ensures that the proposed techniques are grounded in proven research, enhancing the likelihood of successful implementation.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:** The design emphasizes maintaining or reducing computational complexity through lossless compression and hierarchical memory, ensuring that enhancements do not introduce prohibitive computational overhead.\n\nHowever, challenges may arise in ensuring seamless integration without disrupting existing functionalities, particularly maintaining test-time training capabilities.

Soaring from 4K to 400K: Extending LLM\u2019s Context with Activation Beacon (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Peitian Zhang, Zheng Liu, Shitao Xiao, Ninglu Shao, Qiwei Ye, Zhicheng Dou*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts and works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The utilization of long contexts poses a big challenge for LLMs due to their limited context window size. Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 4. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

We introduce Resonance RoPE, a novel approach designed to narrow the generalization gap in TSTL scenarios by refining the interpolation of RoPE features for OOD positions, significantly improving the model performance without additional online computational costs. Furthermore, we present PosGen, a new synthetic benchmark specifically designed for fine-grained behavior analysis in TSTL scenarios, aiming to isolate the constantly increasing difficulty of token generation on long contexts from the challenges of recognizing new token positions. Our experiments on synthetic tasks show that after applying Resonance RoPE, Transformers recognize OOD position better and more robustly. Our extensive LLM experiments also show superior performance after applying Resonance RoPE to the current state-of-the-art RoPE scaling method, YaRN, on both upstream language modeling tasks and a variety of downstream long-text applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/23 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nYuhuai Wu, Markus Norman Rabe, DeLesley Hutchins, and Christian Szegedy. 2022.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Many studies pushed up the baseline to a higher level by modifying the architecture, augmenting data and designing new losses. However, we find previous models still suffer from information fusion problem, although Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Path Aggregation Network (PANet) have alleviated this. Therefore, this study provides an advanced Gatherand-Distribute mechanism (GD) mechanism, which is realized with convolution and self-attention operations. This new designed model named as Gold-YOLO, which boosts the multi-scale feature fusion capabilities and achieves an ideal balance between latency and accuracy across all model scales. Additionally, we implement MAE-style pretraining in the YOLO-series for the first time, allowing YOLOseries models could be to benefit from unsupervised pretraining. Gold-YOLO-N attains an outstanding 39.9% AP on the COCO val2017 datasets and 1030 FPS on a T4 GPU, which outperforms the previous SOTA model YOLOv6-3.0-N with similar FPS by +2.4%.

Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: long context modeling*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.

Our models are built through continual pretraining from Llama 2 checkpoints with longer text sequences and on a dataset where long texts are upsampled. We perform extensive evaluation using language modeling, synthetic context probing tasks, and a wide range of downstream benchmarks. Across all evaluations, our models achieve consistent improvements on most regular-context tasks and significant improvements on long-context tasks over Llama 2. Moreover, with a cost-effective instruction tuning procedure that is free of expensive annotation, the presented models can already surpass \\texttt{gpt-3.5-turbo-16k}\u2018s overall performance on long-context benchmarks. Alongside these results, we provide an in-depth analysis on each individual component of our method. We delve into Llama\u2019s position encodings and discuss its key limitation in modeling long data. We examine the impact of various design choices in the pretraining process, including the data mix and the training curriculum of sequence lengths \u2013 ablation results suggest that having abundant long texts in the pretrain dataset is \\textit{not} the key to achieving strong performance, and we empirically verify that long context continual pretraining is more efficient and similarly effective compared to pretraining from scratch with long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 138  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6.

However, the most commonly used autoregressive models, Transformers, are prohibitively expensive to scale to the number of inputs and layers needed to capture this long-range structure. We develop Perceiver AR, an autoregressive, modality-agnostic architecture which uses cross-attention to map long-range inputs to a small number of latents while also maintaining end-to-end causal masking. Perceiver AR can directly attend to over a hundred thousand tokens, enabling practical long-context density estimation without the need for hand-crafted sparsity patterns or memory mechanisms. When trained on images or music, Perceiver AR generates outputs with clear long-term coherence and structure. Our architecture also obtains state-of-the-art likelihood on long-sequence benchmarks, including 64 x 64 ImageNet images and PG-19 books.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 7. MATTER: Memory-Augmented Transformer Using Heterogeneous Knowledge Sources\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Dongkyu Lee, Chandana Satya Prakash, Jack FitzGerald, Jens Lehmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an efficient memory-augmented transformer called MATTER, designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources, and demonstrates that this model outperforms existing efficient retrieval-augmented models on popular QA benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed.\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging external knowledge is crucial for achieving high performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering. The retrieve-and-read approach is widely adopted for integrating external knowledge into a language model. However, this approach suffers from increased computational cost and latency due to the long context length, which grows proportionally with the number of retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, existing retrieval-augmented models typically retrieve information from a single type of knowledge source, limiting their scalability to diverse knowledge sources with varying structures. In this work, we introduce an efficient memory-augmented transformer called MATTER, designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources. Specifically, our model retrieves and reads from both unstructured sources (paragraphs) and semi-structured sources (QA pairs) in the form of fixed-length neural memories. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing efficient retrieval-augmented models on popular QA benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, MATTER achieves competitive results compared to conventional read-and-retrieve models while having 100x throughput during inference.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions\nand answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and\nmeasure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic\nmodel in two directions.

Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%.

Differential Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: long context modeling*\n\n*Tianzhu Ye, Li Dong, Yuqing Xia, Yutao Sun, Yi Zhu, Gao Huang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this\nwork, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant\ncontext while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention\nmechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate\nsoftmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence\nof sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show\nthat Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up\nmodel size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages\nin practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information\nretrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of\nactivation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff\nTransformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text\nsummarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances\naccuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as\na chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly\neffective and promising architecture to advance large language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-07T17:57:38Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-07T17:57:38Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: long context modeling*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP\n  Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel*\n\n**Abstract:** Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language\nprocessing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods\noften rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or\nuse a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge\nsource. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths\nin terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the\nstrength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented\nTransformer (EMAT) -- it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and\nexploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also\nintroduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value\nrepresentations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory\nslots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks\nsuch as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting\nparametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results\n(e.g., 25.8 -> 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000\nqueries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs\nsubstantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW\nand ELI5.

By incorporating a separate memory module\nalongside the pre-trained transformer, the model can effectively interchange\ninformation between the memory states and the current input context. We\nevaluate our model on three dialogue datasets and two language modeling\ndatasets. Experimental results show that our method has achieved superior\nefficiency and performance compared to other pre-trained Transformer baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-15T22:37:22Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-23T05:59:06Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: long context modeling*\n\n*Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Hari Subramoni, Aamir Shafi, Olatunji Ruwase, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs, Jinghan Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. Masked Language Modeling for Proteins via Linearly Scalable Long-Context Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: long context modeling*\n\n*Valerii Likhosherstov, Lucy Colwell, Xingyou Song, Krzysztof Choromanski, Andreea Gane, Adrian Weller, Jared Davis, David Dohan, David Belanger, Tamas Sarlos, Peter Hawkins*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results across a diverse range of domains. However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. MART: Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer for Coherent Video Paragraph Captioning\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Li-Wei Wang, Yelong Shen, Tamara L. Berg, Mohit Bansal, Jie Lei, Dong Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Generating multi-sentence descriptions for videos is one of the most challenging captioning tasks due to its high requirements for not only visual relevance but also discourse-based coherence across the sentences in the paragraph. Towards this goal, we propose a new approach called Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer (MART), which uses a memory module to augment the transformer architecture. The memory module generates a highly summarized memory state from the video segments and the sentence history so as to help better prediction of the next sentence (w.r.t. coreference and repetition aspects), thus encouraging coherent paragraph generation. Extensive experiments, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses on two popular datasets ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII show that MART generates more coherent and less repetitive paragraph captions than baseline methods, while maintaining relevance to the input video events.

GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have become ubiquitous in natural language processing thanks to their large capacity, innate parallelism and high performance. The contextualizing component of a Transformer block is the $\\textit{pairwise dot-product}$ attention that has a large $\\Omega(L^2)$ memory requirement for length $L$ sequences, limiting its ability to process long documents. This has been the subject of substantial interest recently, where multiple approximations were proposed to reduce the quadratic memory requirement using sparse attention matrices. In this work, we propose to augment sparse Transformer blocks with a dense attention-based $\\textit{global memory}$ of length $M$ ($\\ll L$) which provides an aggregate global view of the entire input sequence to each position. Our augmentation has a manageable $O(M\\cdot(L+M))$ memory overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated with prior sparse solutions. Moreover, global memory can also be used for sequence compression, by representing a long input sequence with the memory representations only. We empirically show that our method leads to substantial improvement on a range of tasks, including (a) synthetic tasks that require global reasoning, (b) masked language modeling, and (c) reading comprehension.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, memory augmentation techniques, and long context modeling, here are some key insights and approaches from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Multi-Head Attention as Mixture-of-Head Attention (MoH)\nThe MoH approach upgrades the traditional multi-head attention mechanism by treating attention heads as experts in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. This method allows each token to select the appropriate attention heads, enhancing inference efficiency without compromising accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. MoH replaces the standard summation in multi-head attention with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility and unlocking extra performance potential. This approach has been shown to outperform traditional multi-head attention by using only 50%-90% of the attention heads.\n\n### Local Attention Mechanism (LAM)\nLAM is a locality-based attention mechanism designed to enhance the efficiency and performance of transformers, particularly in time series data. LAM reduces computational and memory complexity by excluding non-relevant computations in the attention matrix through the use of an additive mask. This mechanism is particularly useful for capturing dependencies in closer time steps, which is crucial for time series data.\n\n### Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention\nThe \"Loki\" approach uses low-rank approximations to select tokens in the key-value cache based on attention scores computed in a low-dimensional space. This method reduces both computational and memory costs, making it an efficient attention computation approach. It balances efficiency with expressiveness by selectively computing attention scores[Analysis Note, 4].\n\n## Memory Augmentation Techniques\n\n### Large Memory Layers with Product Keys\nThis approach integrates structured memory into the architecture, increasing the capacity of the model by up to a billion parameters with negligible computational overhead. This method is promising for efficient memory augmentation and could be integrated with existing architectures like FastTTTLinear to enhance their capacity[Analysis Note, 2].\n\n### Memory Augmentation through Mixture-of-Experts\nThe MoH mechanism also implies a form of memory augmentation by efficiently utilizing attention heads, which can be seen as a form of expert selection. This approach ensures that only the most relevant attention heads are used, thereby optimizing memory usage during inference.\n\n## Long Context Modeling\n\n### 3D Rotary Position Encoding (3D-RPE)\n3D-RPE introduces an advanced position encoding method that enhances long-context modeling by providing controllable long-term decay and improved position resolution. This method is designed to better handle long-range dependencies, which is crucial for understanding sequences with long contexts[Analysis Note, 3].\n\n### Local Attention Mechanism (LAM) for Long-Range Dependencies\nLAM, while primarily designed for time series data, also addresses the issue of capturing long-range dependencies by focusing on local dependencies first. This approach can be adapted to other sequence data types to improve the handling of long-range dependencies.\n\n## Computational Efficiency and Scalability\n\n### Parallelization in Self-Attention\nSelf-attention mechanisms in transformers allow for parallel processing of input sequences, significantly speeding up training times compared to traditional RNNs. This parallelization is a key factor in the computational efficiency and scalability of transformer models.\n\n### Efficient Attention Computation\nMethods like MoH and Loki reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. MoH achieves this by using a weighted summation and selecting relevant attention heads, while Loki uses low-rank approximations to reduce the dimensionality of attention computations[Analysis Note, 4].\n\n## Integration and Compatibility\n\nTo integrate these improvements, it is crucial to maintain compatibility with existing architectures and preserve test-time training capabilities. Combining different attention optimization approaches, such as MoH and Loki, with advanced position encoding methods like 3D-RPE, can provide a balanced improvement in efficiency, expressiveness, and scalability[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these efficient attention mechanisms, memory augmentation techniques, and advanced position encoding methods, researchers can significantly enhance the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/37 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 35151-35174.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical transformer memory implementation, neural compression test-time adaptation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer memory implementation*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Test-Time Adaptation via Conjugate Pseudo-labels\n\n*From Search Query: neural compression test-time adaptation*\n\n*Sachin Goyal, Mingjie Sun, Aditi Raghunathan, Zico Kolter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic recipe is presented that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class, and can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which is referred to as the conjugate pseudolabel.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting neural networks to distribution shifts, with access to only the unlabeled test samples from the new domain at test-time. Prior TTA methods optimize over unsupervised objectives such as the entropy of model predictions in TENT [Wang et al., 2021], but it is unclear what exactly makes a good TTA loss. In this paper, we start by presenting a surprising phenomenon: if we attempt to meta-learn the best possible TTA loss over a wide class of functions, then we recover a function that is remarkably similar to (a temperature-scaled version of) the softmax-entropy employed by TENT. This only holds, however, if the classifier we are adapting is trained via cross-entropy; if trained via squared loss, a different best TTA loss emerges. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze TTA through the lens of the training losses's convex conjugate. We show that under natural conditions, this (unsupervised) conjugate function can be viewed as a good local approximation to the original supervised loss and indeed, it recovers the best losses found by meta-learning. This leads to a generic recipe that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class. Empirically, our approach consistently dominates other baselines over a wide range of benchmarks. Our approach is particularly of interest when applied to classifiers trained with novel loss functions, e.g., the recently-proposed PolyLoss, where it differs substantially from (and outperforms) an entropy-based loss. Further, we show that our approach can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which we refer to as the conjugate pseudolabel. Overall, our method provides a broad framework for better understanding and improving test-time adaptation.

Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural compression test-time adaptation*\n\n*Runzhe Zhan, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

Extrapolative Continuous-time Bayesian Neural Network for Fast Training-free Test-time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: neural compression test-time adaptation*\n\n*Hengguan Huang, Xiangming Gu, Hongya Wang, Chang Xiao, Hongfu Liu, Ye Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to formulate internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context and develops extrap-olative continuous-time Bayesian neural networks (ECBNN 2 ), which generalize existing Bayesian neural networks to represent temporal dynamics and allow us to extrapolate the distribution of model parameters before observing the incoming data, therefore effectively reducing the latency.\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence has shown remarkably lower latency and higher precision than most AI systems when processing non-stationary streaming data in real-time. Numerous neuroscience studies suggest that such abilities may be driven by internal predictive modeling. In this paper, we explore the possibility of introducing such a mechanism in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for handling non-stationary streaming data for real-time streaming applications. We propose to formulate internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context. Such a dynamical system describes the dynamics of model parameters of a UDA model evolving with non-stationary streaming data. Building on such a dynamical system, we then develop extrap-olative continuous-time Bayesian neural networks (ECBNN 2 ), which generalize existing Bayesian neural networks to represent temporal dynamics and allow us to extrapolate the distribution of model parameters before observing the incoming data, therefore effectively reducing the latency. Remarkably, our empirical results show that ECBNN is capable of continuously generating better distributions of model parameters along the time axis given historical data only, thereby achieving (1) training-free test-time adaptation with low latency, (2) gradually improved alignment between the source and target features and (3) gradually improved model performance over time during the real-time testing stage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer memory implementation*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer memory implementation*\n\n*Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun, Neha Prakriya, Zongyue Qin, Zifan He*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in language processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context window that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous works in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context and maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures, which have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are good at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models' long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior. Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. Evaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and question-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the long-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models. With an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment future LLMs to handle long context effectively.

A Winning Hand: Compressing Deep Networks Can Improve Out-Of-Distribution Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: neural compression test-time adaptation*\n\n*Bhavya Kailkhura, Jize Zhang, Shreya Chaganti, Brian R. Bartoldson, James Diffenderfer*\n\n**Abstract:** Successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in the wild requires models to be: (1) compact, (2) accurate, and (3) robust to distributional shifts. Unfortunately, efforts towards simultaneously meeting these requirements have mostly been unsuccessful. This raises an important question: Is the inability to create Compact, Accurate, and Robust Deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental? To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of popular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" approaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight CARDs. Specifically, we are able to create extremely compact CARDs that, compared to their larger counterparts, have similar test accuracy and matching (or better) robustness -- simply by pruning and (optionally) quantizing. Leveraging the compactness of CARDs, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling approach (CARD-Decks) that uses a gating module to dynamically select appropriate CARDs from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with test samples. The proposed approach builds a \"winning hand'' of CARDs that establishes a new state-of-the-art (on RobustBench) on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% standard and 92.75% robust) and CIFAR-100-C accuracies (80.6% standard and 71.3% robust) with better memory usage than non-compressed baselines (pretrained CARDs and CARD-Decks available at https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench). Finally, we provide theoretical support for our empirical findings.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 4. Maybe Deep Neural Networks are the Best Choice for Modeling Source Code\n\n*From Search Query: neural compression test-time adaptation*\n\n*Rafael-Michael Karampatsis, Charles Sutton*\n\n**Abstract:** Statistical language modeling techniques have successfully been applied to\nsource code, yielding a variety of new software development tools, such as\ntools for code suggestion and improving readability. A major issue with these\ntechniques is that code introduces new vocabulary at a far higher rate than\nnatural language, as new identifier names proliferate. But traditional language\nmodels limit the vocabulary to a fixed set of common words. For code, this\nstrong assumption has been shown to have a significant negative effect on\npredictive performance. But the open vocabulary version of the neural network\nlanguage models for code have not been introduced in the literature. We present\na new open-vocabulary neural language model for code that is not limited to a\nfixed vocabulary of identifier names. We employ a segmentation into subword\nunits, subsequences of tokens chosen based on a compression criterion,\nfollowing previous work in machine translation. Our network achieves best in\nclass performance, outperforming even the state-of-the-art methods of\nHellendoorn and Devanbu that are designed specifically to model code.\nFurthermore, we present a simple method for dynamically adapting the model to a\nnew test project, resulting in increased performance. We showcase our\nmethodology on code corpora in three different languages of over a billion\ntokens each, hundreds of times larger than in previous work. To our knowledge,\nthis is the largest neural language model for code that has been reported.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical memory implementations, compression techniques, and integration with test-time adaptation mechanisms, here are some key insights and details from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Implementations\n\n### MemTree\nThe \"MemTree\" approach described in utilizes a dynamic tree-structured memory representation. This method integrates new information into the existing memory hierarchy efficiently by using a top-down hierarchical clustering algorithm. MemTree maintains a hierarchical organization of memory, which is updated based on content similarity and structural depth. This approach ensures computational efficiency by parallelizing content aggregation and embedding updates, making it suitable for long-context processing.\n\n### HLogformer\nThe HLogformer architecture, as outlined in, is designed to process hierarchical log data. It segments log data according to its hierarchical tree structure, summarizing information at each level and passing only the accumulated summary vectors to the next step. This hierarchical processing reduces memory and computational costs, making it efficient for downstream tasks like anomaly detection and log classification.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT)\nThe \"HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer\" mentioned in the analysis note, leverages memory-augmented segment-level recurrence to organize the memory hierarchy. It preserves tokens from early input token segments, enabling effective long-context processing. This hierarchical memory organization is crucial for efficient handling of long sequences.\n\n## Compression Techniques\n\n### Infini-attention\nThe \"Infini-attention\" mechanism, as mentioned in the analysis note, incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism. It combines masked local attention and long-term linear attention, demonstrating effective memory compression. This approach can reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.\n\n### HLogformer's Summarization\nHLogformer's method of summarizing information at each level of the hierarchical structure can be seen as a form of compression. By passing only the accumulated summary vectors to the next step, it reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed, thereby reducing memory and computational costs.\n\n## Integration with Test-Time Adaptation Mechanisms\n\n### Dynamic Memory Updates\nMemTree's dynamic memory update mechanism can be integrated with test-time adaptation by continuously updating the memory hierarchy based on new inputs. This ensures that the model adapts to new information efficiently, which is crucial for test-time adaptation.\n\n### Self-Supervised Learning\nHLogformer's training strategy, which includes masked language modeling and volume hypersphere minimization, can be adapted for test-time learning. By continuously updating the model with new data using these self-supervised methods, the model can adapt to new contexts and maintain its performance over time.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\nCombining different attention mechanisms, such as linear and sliding window attention, as seen in \"Simple linear attention language models,\" can offer better efficiency-expressiveness trade-offs. Integrating these hybrid attention mechanisms with hierarchical memory architectures and compression techniques can enhance the model's ability to adapt at test time[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Linear Attention Variants\nLinear attention variants, such as those used in \"Simple linear attention language models,\" can be combined with hierarchical memory to improve efficiency. These variants enable better scaling and reduce computational overhead, making them suitable for integrating with test-time adaptation mechanisms[Analysis Note].\n\n### Low-Rank Approximations\nUsing low-rank approximations for attention mechanisms can significantly reduce computation while maintaining performance. This can be integrated with hierarchical memory architectures to enhance efficiency and adaptability at test time[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the key strategies for improving autoregressive language models include:\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory**: Implementations like MemTree and HLogformer that organize memory hierarchically to efficiently process long contexts.\n- **Compression Techniques**: Methods such as Infini-attention and HLogformer's summarization to reduce computational overhead.\n- **Test-Time Adaptation**: Dynamic memory updates and self-supervised learning strategies to adapt the model to new inputs.\n- **Hybrid Attention Mechanisms**: Combining different attention types, such as linear and sliding window attention, to enhance efficiency and expressiveness.\n\nThese approaches can be integrated to create a robust and efficient autoregressive language model that scales well and adapts effectively at test time.\n",

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2. LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (Avg. Score: 0.46)\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) is introduced, a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU memory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/16 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\n# LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention \n\nYumeng Wang* ${ }^{1}$ Zhenyang Xiao ${ }^{* 12}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU memory and computational resources when handling long contexts.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/16 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nA comprehensive code listing detailing the aforementioned steps is presented in Appendix A. ### 3.2. Performance analysis\n\nIn this analysis, we evaluated the extent to which LoMA reduces the computational and storage resource requirements. Without loss of generality, we compared the standard autoregressive generation algorithm with the LoMA generation in the absence of prompts. Let $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ denote the time it takes for the model to complete one inference on a token sequence of length $l$ with a key-value (KV) cache of length $k$. Assuming the total generation spans $m$ chunks, each consisting of $t c$ tokens, the generation time for a traditional transformer is given by:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{m t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)\n$$\n\nUnder a preset compression ratio $c$ and memory length $t$, LoMA performs one inference every $t c$ tokens with $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens, resulting in a total generation time of:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=y t}^{y t+t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)+m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)\n$$\n\nTypically, $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ is much less than $l T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)$. Our tests conducted on an A100 GPU demonstrate this point, see Fig. 2. Consequently, even though the additional term $m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)$ of the LoMA generation process slightly increases the computation, the significant compression of the KV cache results in a notable reduction in both generation time and memory usage, as illustrated in the table 1. ## 4. Training\n\nTo equip the transformer model with the aforementioned memory compression capability, pre-training or fine-tuning procedures are essential. We have devised a training procedure that includes structured reorganization of input samples, a novel loss terms, a unique design attention mask, and a specialized pattern of PositionIDs. ### 4.1. Input Samples\n\nIn the training procedure of LoMA, the original sequence of tokens is segmented into multiple subsequences each of length $t c$. To each subsequence, $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens followed by $t c$ '<r>' tokens are appended, forming a training chunk. All training chunks are concatenated to form a new structured sequence as a training sample. see Fig 3. ### 4.2. Loss\n\nTo train a Transformer model using the structured input sequence mentioned above, it is necessary to extend the vanilla loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LM}}$ with an additional term that endows the model with the capability to compress memory. Since the output of model on the memory zone is not of concern, with the KV-cache in this zone being utilized to store compressed information, there is no need to design labels or a loss function for the memory zone. Indirectly, the memory zone is supervised through the loss applied to the repetition zone. Consequently, the training loss for each chunk is calculated as the sum of these two components, and the total loss across all chunks is determined by:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\sum_{y=1}^{m}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}$ is the loss generated by the reading zone of the $y$-th training chunk while $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}$ corresponds to the loss produced by the repetition zone. Let the token subsequence from the reading zone be denoted as $\\operatorname{READ}_{y}=\\left\\{x_{k}, x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+t c}\\right\\}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left(x_{i}\\right), x_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis same with the standard trainning loss and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{REP}}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left({ }^{\\prime}<\\mathrm{r}>^{\\prime}{ }_{i+t(c+1)}\\right), x_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{CE}($ logits, label) refers to the standard cross-entropy loss function, and the $M(x)$ is the set of logits produced\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-04.jpg?height=324&width=836&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=1054)\n\nFigure 4: This figure describes the correspondence between inputs and labels. In reading zone, the input and target exhibit a standard autoregressive relationship. No labels are set in the memory zone, while the labels in the repetition zone consist of content from the reading zone. We demonstrated in Section.4.4 that by backpropagating gradients through the repetition zone, a supervisory signal can be provided to the memory zone. This allows the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token to learn to compress the content of the reading zone into its own KV . by the model $M$ for the token $x$. The term ' $<\\mathrm{r}>{ }^{\\prime}{ }_{k+t(c+1)}$ refers to the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token at position $k+t(c+1)$, indicating that the model's prediction for each ' $<$ r>' token should be identical with the corresponding token in the reading zone.\n```\n\n#### 3. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory compression transformer implementation, dynamic parameter adaptation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Deep Compression of Pre-trained Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Naigang Wang, Chia-Chun Liu, Swagath Venkataramani, Sanchari Sen, Chia-Yu Chen, K. E. Maghraoui, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Le Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision are introduced and critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning are identified.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained transformer models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and have recently become competitive alternatives to Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in vision and speech tasks, respectively. Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Agustsson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression by independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past.\n\n**Abstract:** We show how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression. Previous methods have been relying on an increasing number of architectural biases and priors, including motion prediction and warping operations, resulting in complex models. Instead, we independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past. The resulting video compression transformer outperforms previous methods on standard video compression data sets. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model learns to handle complex motion patterns such as panning, blurring and fading purely from data. Our approach is easy to implement, and we release code to facilitate future research.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 77  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Recurrent Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 85  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. DoRA: Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Rank Distribution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Yulong Mao, Kaiyu Huang, Changhao Guan, Ganglin Bao, Fengran Mo, Jinan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive task. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs substantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application of downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the differential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce the Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA and full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the same storage parameter budget.

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Prompter: Zero-shot Adaptive Prefixes for Dialogue State Tracking Domain Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Taha \u0130brahim Aksu, MingSung Kan, Nancy F.

Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) has the potential to address this problem due to its robustness. However, it has yet to be applied to the zero-shot scenarios, as it is not clear how to apply it unsupervisedly. Our method, Prompter, uses descriptions of target domain slots to generate dynamic prefixes that are concatenated to the key and values at each layer\u2019s self-attention mechanism. This allows for the use of prefix-tuning in zero-shot. Prompter outperforms previous methods on both the MultiWOZ and SGD benchmarks. In generating prefixes, our analyses find that Prompter not only utilizes the semantics of slot descriptions but also how often the slots appear together in conversation. Moreover, Prompter\u2019s gains are due to its improved ability to distinguish \u201dnone\u201d-valued dialogue slots, compared against baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Adapter Meets Prompt Tuning: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Point Cloud Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Zhikang Zou, Yihan Xu, Xingkui Zhu, Wei Xu, Dingkang Liang, Xin Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Point cloud analysis has achieved outstanding performance by transferring point cloud pre-trained models. However, existing methods for model adaptation usually update all model parameters, i.e., full fine-tuning paradigm, which is inefficient as it relies on high computational costs (e.g., training GPU memory) and massive storage space. In this paper, we aim to study parameter-efficient transfer learning for point cloud analysis with an ideal trade-off between task performance and parameter efficiency. To achieve this goal, we freeze the parameters of the default pre-trained models and then propose the Dynamic Adapter, which generates a dynamic scale for each token, considering the token significance to the downstream task. We further seamlessly integrate Dynamic Adapter with Prompt Tuning (DAPT) by constructing Internal Prompts, capturing the instance-specific features for interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAPT achieves superior performance compared to the full fine-tuning counterparts while significantly reducing the trainable parameters and training GPU memory by 95% and 35%, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/LMD0311/DAPT.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on memory compression techniques and dynamic parameter adaptation, here are some key insights and implementation details from the provided sources:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nThe work on NAMMs introduces a novel memory evolution framework that optimizes transformer models by managing the latent memory KV cache. This approach reduces the memory footprint significantly while improving performance. NAMMs condition the memory on features constructed from the attention matrix, allowing for universal applicability to any transformer-based architecture. By evolving NAMMs on top of pre-trained models, substantial reductions in the number of retained tokens in the KV cache are achieved, along with performance improvements.\n\n### Model Compression and Quantization\nModel compression techniques such as quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation are crucial for reducing the size and inference time of large language models. Quantization reduces the number of bits used to represent each weight, leading to smaller model sizes. Pruning involves removing less important weights, enhancing inference speed. Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from a larger model to a smaller one, maintaining performance while reducing size. For example, using OpenVINO, a BERT-base model can be optimized to be 80% sparse and 8-bit quantized, significantly reducing memory throughput and increasing computational speed.\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nMemristor-based in-memory computing can accelerate matrix-matrix multiplication in transformer self-attention, leading to a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts. This method involves transforming weight matrices into memristor conductance matrices and executing inference on a hybrid circuit model. This approach can be integrated into existing architectures to enhance memory efficiency and computational speed.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Adaptation\n\n### Memory-Augmented Transformers (Memformers)\nMemformers can implement linear first-order optimization methods such as conjugate gradient descent and momentum methods by maintaining memory registers across layers. These registers store intermediate attention values, allowing the model to refine search directions and update parameters dynamically. This capability extends the model's ability to learn complex optimization algorithms, which can be beneficial for dynamic parameter adaptation.\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs) for Dynamic Adaptation\nNAMMs enable dynamic memory updates and zero-shot transferability across different tasks and architectures. By training NAMMs on language tasks, they can be adapted to new transformer models and input modalities, including vision and reinforcement learning. This adaptability allows for efficient test-time adaptation and dynamic parameter tuning without the need for retraining the entire model.\n\n### Model Parallelism and Adaptive Optimization\nModel parallelism and adaptive optimization algorithms (e.g., AdamW) can also contribute to dynamic parameter adaptation. By distributing the model across multiple GPUs, model parallelism reduces memory requirements and speeds up training. Adaptive optimization algorithms adjust the learning rate based on parameter updates, leading to faster convergence and improved training efficiency. These techniques can be combined with memory compression and hierarchical memory structures to enhance overall model performance and adaptability.\n\n## Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Organization\nIntegrating hierarchical memory structures, such as those in the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), with efficient attention mechanisms and memory compression techniques can significantly enhance model performance. HMT organizes memory hierarchically, preserving tokens from early input segments and allowing for efficient processing of long sequences. Combining this with NAMMs or Memformers can provide a balanced approach to local and global information processing while maintaining efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Combining Attention Mechanisms\nHybrid attention mechanisms, such as combining different attention types or using low-rank approximations, can be integrated with memory compression and dynamic parameter adaptation techniques. For example, using linear attention variants can offer better scaling while maintaining performance, which is crucial for large autoregressive language models[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of memory usage but also more adaptable and scalable, leading to improved performance in various tasks.\n",

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/16 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nA comprehensive code listing detailing the aforementioned steps is presented in Appendix A. ### 3.2. Performance analysis\n\nIn this analysis, we evaluated the extent to which LoMA reduces the computational and storage resource requirements. Without loss of generality, we compared the standard autoregressive generation algorithm with the LoMA generation in the absence of prompts. Let $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ denote the time it takes for the model to complete one inference on a token sequence of length $l$ with a key-value (KV) cache of length $k$. Assuming the total generation spans $m$ chunks, each consisting of $t c$ tokens, the generation time for a traditional transformer is given by:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{m t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)\n$$\n\nUnder a preset compression ratio $c$ and memory length $t$, LoMA performs one inference every $t c$ tokens with $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens, resulting in a total generation time of:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=y t}^{y t+t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)+m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)\n$$\n\nTypically, $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ is much less than $l T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)$. Our tests conducted on an A100 GPU demonstrate this point, see Fig. 2. Consequently, even though the additional term $m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)$ of the LoMA generation process slightly increases the computation, the significant compression of the KV cache results in a notable reduction in both generation time and memory usage, as illustrated in the table 1. ## 4. Training\n\nTo equip the transformer model with the aforementioned memory compression capability, pre-training or fine-tuning procedures are essential. We have devised a training procedure that includes structured reorganization of input samples, a novel loss terms, a unique design attention mask, and a specialized pattern of PositionIDs. ### 4.1. Input Samples\n\nIn the training procedure of LoMA, the original sequence of tokens is segmented into multiple subsequences each of length $t c$. To each subsequence, $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens followed by $t c$ '<r>' tokens are appended, forming a training chunk. All training chunks are concatenated to form a new structured sequence as a training sample. see Fig 3. ### 4.2. Loss\n\nTo train a Transformer model using the structured input sequence mentioned above, it is necessary to extend the vanilla loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LM}}$ with an additional term that endows the model with the capability to compress memory. Since the output of model on the memory zone is not of concern, with the KV-cache in this zone being utilized to store compressed information, there is no need to design labels or a loss function for the memory zone. Indirectly, the memory zone is supervised through the loss applied to the repetition zone. Consequently, the training loss for each chunk is calculated as the sum of these two components, and the total loss across all chunks is determined by:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\sum_{y=1}^{m}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}$ is the loss generated by the reading zone of the $y$-th training chunk while $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}$ corresponds to the loss produced by the repetition zone. Let the token subsequence from the reading zone be denoted as $\\operatorname{READ}_{y}=\\left\\{x_{k}, x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+t c}\\right\\}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left(x_{i}\\right), x_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis same with the standard trainning loss and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{REP}}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left({ }^{\\prime}<\\mathrm{r}>^{\\prime}{ }_{i+t(c+1)}\\right), x_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{CE}($ logits, label) refers to the standard cross-entropy loss function, and the $M(x)$ is the set of logits produced\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-04.jpg?height=324&width=836&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=1054)\n\nFigure 4: This figure describes the correspondence between inputs and labels. In reading zone, the input and target exhibit a standard autoregressive relationship. No labels are set in the memory zone, while the labels in the repetition zone consist of content from the reading zone. We demonstrated in Section.4.4 that by backpropagating gradients through the repetition zone, a supervisory signal can be provided to the memory zone. This allows the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token to learn to compress the content of the reading zone into its own KV . by the model $M$ for the token $x$. The term ' $<\\mathrm{r}>{ }^{\\prime}{ }_{k+t(c+1)}$ refers to the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token at position $k+t(c+1)$, indicating that the model's prediction for each ' $<$ r>' token should be identical with the corresponding token in the reading zone.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: lossless memory compression transformer, test-time training compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight Compression\n\n*From Search Query: lossless memory compression transformer*\n\n*Tim Dettmers, Ruslan Svirschevski, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Saleh Ashkboos, Alexander Borzunov, T. Hoefler, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to high-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via quantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited devices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However, quantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high accuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range, which are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we introduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format and quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless compression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression levels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier weights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them in higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and achieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for highly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B parameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance degradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer without any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding weights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime. Specifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which yields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while enabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 155  (*Influential: 22*)\n\n#### 2.

Due to their excellent computational ef\ufb01-ciency and scalability, transformer models can be trained on exceedingly large amounts of data at the expense of tremendous growth in model size. As high performance, large-scale, and pre-trained transformer models become increasingly available for users to download and \ufb01ne-tune for customized downstream tasks, their deployment becomes challenging due to the vast amount of operations and large memory footprint. To address this challenge, we introduce methods to deeply compress pre-trained transformer models across three major application domains: NLP, speech, and vision. Speci\ufb01cally, we quantize transformer backbones down to 4-bit and further achieve 50% \ufb01ne-grained structural sparsity on pre-trained BERT, Wav2vec2.0, and Vision Transformer (ViT) models to demonstrate 16x compression while maintaining model accuracy. This is achieved by identifying critical initialization strategies for quantization-and sparsity-aware \ufb01ne-tuning as well as developing novel techniques such as quantizers with a zero-preserving format and scheduled dropout. These hardware-friendly techniques need only to be applied in the \ufb01ne-tuning phase for downstream tasks, which renders them especially suitable for acceleration and deployment of pre-trained transformer models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, cache brings new memory-related costs and prevents leveraging larger batch size for faster speed. We propose memory-efficient lossless attention (called EL-attention) to address this issue. It avoids heavy operations for building multi-head keys and values, cache for them is not needed. EL-attention constructs an ensemble of attention results by expanding query while keeping key and value shared. It produces the same result as multi-head attention with less GPU memory and faster inference speed. We conduct extensive experiments on Transformer, BART, and GPT-2 for summarization and question generation tasks. The results show EL-attention speeds up existing models by 1.6x to 5.3x without accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5.

We demonstrate that a uniform noise channel can also be implemented at test time using universal quantization (Ziv, 1985). This allows us to eliminate the mismatch between training and test phases while maintaining a completely differentiable loss function. Implementing the uniform noise channel is a special case of a more general problem to communicate a sample, which we prove is computationally hard if we do not make assumptions about its distribution. However, the uniform special case is efficient as well as easy to implement and thus of great interest from a practical point of view. Finally, we show that quantization can be obtained as a limiting case of a soft quantizer applied to the uniform noise channel, bridging compression with and without quantization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 6. You Only Train Once: Loss-Conditional Training of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training compression*\n\n*Alexey Dosovitskiy, Josip Djolonga*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a method that allows replacing multiple models trained on one loss function each by a single model trained on a distribution of losses, and demonstrates this approach on three tasks with parametrized losses: beta-VAE, learned image compression, and fast style transfer.\n\n**Abstract:** In many machine learning problems, loss functions are weighted sums of several terms. A typical approach to dealing with these is to train multiple separate models with different selections of weights and then either choose the best one according to some criterion or keep multiple models if it is desirable to maintain a diverse set of solutions. This is inefficient both at training and at inference time. We propose a method that allows replacing multiple models trained on one loss function each by a single model trained on a distribution of losses. At test time a model trained this way can be conditioned to generate outputs corresponding to any loss from the training distribution of losses.

GEAR: An Efficient KV Cache Compression Recipe for Near-Lossless Generative Inference of LLM\n\n*From Search Query: lossless memory compression transformer*\n\n*Tuo Zhao, Tushar Krishna, Zaoxing Liu, Geonhwa Jeong, Souvik Kundu, Qingru Zhang, Hao Kang*\n\n**Abstract:** Key-value (KV) caching has become the de-facto to accelerate generation speed for large language models (LLMs) inference. However, the growing cache demand with increasing sequence length has transformed LLM inference to be a memory bound problem, significantly constraining the system throughput. Existing methods rely on dropping unimportant tokens or quantizing all entries uniformly. Such methods, however, often incur high approximation errors to represent the compressed matrices. The autoregressive decoding process further compounds the error of each step, resulting in critical deviation in model generation and deterioration of performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose GEAR, an efficient KV cache compression framework that achieves near-lossless high-ratio compression. GEAR first applies quantization to majority of entries of similar magnitudes to ultra-low precision. It then employs a low rank matrix to approximate the quantization error, and a sparse matrix to remedy individual errors from outlier entries. By adeptly integrating three techniques, GEAR is able to fully exploit their synergistic potentials. Our experiments demonstrate that compared to alternatives, GEAR achieves near-lossless 4-bit KV cache compression with up to 2.38x throughput improvement, while reducing peak-memory size up to 2.29x.

Adaptive spectral proper orthogonal decomposition of tonal flows\n\n*From Search Query: lossless memory compression transformer*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** An adaptive algorithm for spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of mixed broadband-tonal turbulent flows is developed. Sharp peak resolution at tonal frequencies is achieved by locally minimizing the bias of the spectrum. Smooth spectrum estimates of broadband regions are achieved by locally reducing the variance of the spectrum. The method utilizes multitaper estimation with sine tapers. An iterative criterion based on modal convergence is introduced to enable the SPOD to adapt to spectral features. For tonal flows, the adaptivity is controlled by a single user input; for broadband flows, a constant number of sine tapers is recommended without adaptivity. The discrete version of Parseval's theorem for SPOD is stated. Proper normalization of the tapers ensures that Parseval's theorem is satisfied in expectation. Drastic savings in computational complexity and memory usage are facilitated by two aspects: (i) sine tapers, which permit post hoc windowing of a single Fourier transform; and (ii) time-domain lossless compression using a QR or eigenvalue decomposition. Sine-taper SPOD is demonstrated on time-resolved particle image velocimetry (TR-PIV) data from an open cavity flow and high-fidelity large-eddy simulation (LES) data from a round jet, with and without adaptivity. For the tonal cavity flow, the adaptive algorithm outperforms Slepian-based multitaper SPOD in terms of variance and local bias of the spectrum, mode convergence, and memory usage.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Test-Time Training Can Close the Natural Distribution Shift Performance Gap in Deep Learning Based Compressed Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training compression*\n\n*Reinhard Heckel, Jiayu Liu, Mohammad Zalbagi Darestani*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning based image reconstruction methods outperform traditional methods. However, neural networks suffer from a performance drop when applied to images from a different distribution than the training images. For example, a model trained for reconstructing knees in accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not reconstruct brains well, even though the same network trained on brains reconstructs brains perfectly well. Thus there is a distribution shift performance gap for a given neural network, defined as the difference in performance when training on a distribution $P$ and training on another distribution $Q$, and evaluating both models on $Q$. In this work, we propose a domain adaptation method for deep learning based compressive sensing that relies on self-supervision during training paired with test-time training at inference. We show that for four natural distribution shifts, this method essentially closes the distribution shift performance gap for state-of-the-art architectures for accelerated MRI.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 4.

ARDMs are simple to implement and easy to train. Unlike standard ARMs, they do not require causal masking of model representations, and can be trained using an efficient objective similar to modern probabilistic diffusion models that scales favourably to highly-dimensional data. At test time, ARDMs support parallel generation which can be adapted to fit any given generation budget. We find that ARDMs require significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to attain the same performance. Finally, we apply ARDMs to lossless compression, and show that they are uniquely suited to this task. Contrary to existing approaches based on bits-back coding, ARDMs obtain compelling results not only on complete datasets, but also on compressing single data points. Moreover, this can be done using a modest number of network calls for (de)compression due to the model's adaptable parallel generation.\n\n**Conference:** autoregressive-diffusion-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on lossless memory compression techniques in transformers and their integration with test-time training, here are some key points and methods extracted from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Lossless Memory Compression in Transformers\n\n### Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA)\nThe LoMA approach introduces a method for lossless compression of the KV cache in transformers. This technique compresses the KV cache after every \\( tc \\) generated tokens with a specified compression ratio and target compressed length. This method is crucial for efficient memory management without losing any information, which is essential for maintaining model capabilities.\n\n### Implementation Details\n- **Compression Ratio and Target Length**: LoMA compresses the KV cache with a specified compression ratio \\( c \\) and a target compressed length \\( t \\), ensuring that the compressed cache does not exceed a certain size.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: This approach can significantly reduce memory requirements, making it suitable for models that need to process long sequences or handle large amounts of data.\n\n## Integration with Test-Time Training\n\n### Adaptive Online Compressors\nThe concept of adaptive online compressors, as discussed in the context of multimodal compression, can be applied to test-time training. These compressors are trained from scratch on the data stream being compressed, which means they do not require pre-trained weights to be stored or communicated. This approach can be adapted for transformers to enable dynamic compression during test-time training, ensuring that the model can adapt to new data without significant overhead.\n\n### Dynamic Memory Updates\nDynamic memory updates can be integrated with test-time training by continuously compressing and decompressing the memory as new tokens are generated. This ensures that the model can efficiently store and retrieve information without losing context, which is vital for maintaining performance during test-time training.\n\n## Preservation of Model Capabilities\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Organization\nImplementing a hierarchical memory organization can help in efficient long-sequence processing. This involves storing local and global information in a structured manner, allowing the model to access and update this information efficiently. This approach ensures that the model's capabilities are preserved even with compressed memory[Analysis Note].\n\n### Efficient Context Handling\nEfficient context handling is crucial when integrating memory compression with test-time training. This involves ensuring that the compressed memory does not lose contextual information, which can be achieved through careful design of the compression and decompression algorithms. For example, LoMA ensures that the compressed KV cache retains all necessary information, thus preserving the model's performance.\n\n## Techniques for Efficient Parameter Adaptation\n\n### Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation\nDynamic low-rank adaptation, such as the approach in DoRA, can be used to enhance parameter-efficient fine-tuning. This involves decomposing high-rank layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning and efficient parameter updates during inference and test-time training[Analysis Note].\n\n### Sparse Parameter Updates\nSparse parameter updates can reduce the computational overhead during test-time training. By updating only the necessary parameters, the model can adapt efficiently to new data without significant computational costs. This can be combined with lossless memory compression to ensure that the model remains efficient and effective[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers can focus on:\n\n- Implementing lossless KV cache compression using methods like LoMA.\n- Integrating adaptive online compressors for dynamic compression during test-time training.\n- Using hierarchical memory organization and efficient context handling to preserve model capabilities.\n- Employing dynamic low-rank adaptation and sparse parameter updates for efficient parameter adaptation.\n\nThese techniques can help in achieving low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability for autoregressive language models.\n",

Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/25 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10323-10333, 2023.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n#### 4. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n#### 2. Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/25 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10323-10333, 2023.

This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nThis method stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation.

We evaluate its performance on the PG19, Proof-pile, and LongBench datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-04.jpg?height=375&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Segmentation and Reassembly process in SF-Attn. The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs. A cost-effective method for KV cache compression is token dropping [25, 43, 16], which establishes an importance policy to retain significant KVs and remove insignificant ones.\n```\n\n#### 4. Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/68 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n2021.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model.

The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n#### 2. SinkLoRA: Enhanced Efficiency and Chat Capabilities for Long-Context Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.52)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nThis method stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. - Our SinkLoRA performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate its performance on the PG19, Proof-pile, and LongBench datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-04.jpg?height=375&width=1313&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 4: Illustration of the Segmentation and Reassembly process in SF-Attn. The process involves three steps: (1) Splitting features along the head dimension into two chunks: one shifted and one unshifted. (2) Splitting tokens, where the tokens belonging to the shifted chunk are shifted by half of the group size, and reassembling them at the tail of the tokens to match the unshifted chunk. (3) Combining the two chunks of tokens together. This figure is adapted from [6]. Specifically, for LLaMA2 7B, SinkLoRA outperforms LongLoRA and is competitive with LongChat-13B. ### 1.1 Motivation for the Research\n\n## Motivation 1: Elevating Attention Scores for Initial Tokens\n\nPrior studies have demonstrated the Attention Sink phenomenon, where certain tokens, typically the initial tokens in a sequence, receive disproportionately high attention scores during the model's computation [39]. This often occurs because these tokens are visible to all subsequent tokens, leading to significant attention even when they lack semantic importance, particularly in autoregressive language models [33]. The Sparse Shifted Attention mechanism implemented in LongLoRA [6] attempts to address this by shifting the high attention scores from these initial tokens to other tokens that previously received lower attention. This shift reduces the overemphasis on initial tokens. To further improve this, we need to develop a method that directly modifies the attention pattern. By applying this technique, we can effectively redistribute attention scores, thereby reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. ## Motivation 2: Maintaining Initial Tokens During Fine-Tuning\n\nThe concept of attention sinks is also utilized in Streaming LLM [39] to improve the model's handling of long texts. By retaining the Key-Value (KV) pairs of a few initial tokens (attention sinks) along with the most recent tokens, the model ensures stable attention scores and performance even for extended sequences. Inspired by this approach, we aim to carry this mindset from training into inference. Our research aims to modify the fine-tuning process so that initial tokens attend to all other tokens, thereby accumulating more attention scores and enhancing the model's capacity to handle long sequences. ## Motivation 3: Flexible Deployment of Inference Strategy\n\nEfficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments often relies on Key-Value (KV) caching [16]. KV caching stores the key-value states of previously generated tokens, significantly reducing the need for repetitive computations and thus lowering latency in autoregressive generation. However, LongLoRA [6] retains only the original standard self-attention mechanism during inference. To address this limitation, it is necessary to apply an optional KV cache function. This enhancement allows for a more flexible and efficient inference strategy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining model performance. ## 2 Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Long-context Transformers\n\nThe primary obstacle in scaling Transformer models to handle longer sequence lengths lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. This quadratic computational burden has prompted significant research efforts focused on developing more efficient sparse Transformer models. Notable examples include Longformer [4] and BigBird [41], which utilize a combination of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, thereby reducing the complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$. These models achieve a balance between maintaining sufficient context for understanding while managing computational load. For achieving complexity of $O(n \\log n)$, several approaches have been proposed. Fixed Window Attention [7] employs a fixed-size window for attention, which confines the attention computation to a limited context window. Reformer [21] introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thus reducing the computational complexity. LSG Attention [9], adapted from BigBird, combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead. Equipping Transformer [40] proposes a novel reading strategy termed random access, which enables Transformers to efficiently process long documents without needing to examine every token. This method shows promising results across pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference phases, demonstrating its efficacy in handling extended contexts. Despite these advancements, the ability of these methods to manage long-context conversations, such as those required in chat applications, remains limited. This highlights an ongoing challenge in enhancing the context-handling capabilities of Transformer models for interactive and real-time applications. ### 2.2 Long-context LLMs\n\nRecent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly extended their capabilities, including handling long-context inputs. Math Word Problems (MWPs) have demonstrated notable performance in solving mathematical questions using LLMs [34]. Moreover, leveraging LLMs for SQL querying has shown promise in optimizing resource allocation, though it remains less efficient than traditional relational databases [42]. LongLoRA [6], employing Position Interpolation [5], has successfully extended the context window of Llama 2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens without requiring substantial GPU or TPU resources. Meta's Llama 3, featuring up to 70 billion parameters, represents a significant advancement in open-source LLMs, offering enhancements in computational efficiency, trust and safety tools, and collaborations with major platforms [38]. Open-source models such as BLOOM [22], OPT [18], and Falcon [28] continue to challenge proprietary models, although models like Vicuna [29] and Alpaca [1] still lag behind their closed-source counterparts in certain aspects. Despite these advancements, effectively managing long-context interactions remains a significant challenge, necessitating ongoing research and development to address the complexities in long-context LLM applications. ### 2.3 KV-Cache Compression\n\nCompressing the size of KV cache is more difficult than reducing the size of weights because they are more sensitive and dependent on model inputs. A cost-effective method for KV cache compression is token dropping [25, 43, 16], which establishes an importance policy to retain significant KVs and remove insignificant ones.\n```\n\n#### 3. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/25 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10323-10333, 2023.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/16 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nMore or less, some important information will be lost. ### 2.2. Explicit Memory\n\nExplicit memory is the conscious, intentional recollection of factual information, previous experiences, and concepts. Some method for Explicit memory compression are proposed by (Lanchantin et al., 2023), (Jiang et al., 2023b). Those approach involves the generation of a summary of preceding text, which is then inserted into the generated text, allowing subsequent text generation to utilize this summary to produce more coherent text. The downsides of this method include: 1) the generated summary occupies a significant portion of the text length, resulting in shorter generated text; 2) the process of generating a summary is also autoregressive, leading to a substantial increase in generation time; 3) the generated summary may omit some critical information, compromising the accuracy of the resulting text; and 4) a considerable amount of annotated data is required to fine-tune the model, which is costly. In (Mu et al., 2023), a novel compression method was introduced. This method involves inserting a 'gist token' between the prompt and response and employing a specially designed mask to ensure that the response chunk can only extract information from the gist token. During generation, the prompt is compressed into a gist token and then the original prompt is discarded to save resources. This approach effectively reduces memory usage. However, it's important to note that this method is not lossless and results in a significant loss of information. In contrast, our method achieves lossless compression of information into a ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token, ensuring that no information is lost. ## 3. Method\n\nThe LoMA framework introduces an enhanced autoregressive generation algorithm that leverages a transformer model\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=475&width=809&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2: This figure delineates the relationship between single inference latency and KV cache length across various input token sequence lengths. The findings indicate that the latency of a single inference grows linearly with the length of the KV cache, yet the augmentation of input token sequence length does not substantially affect the computation time. Notably, when the input sequence consists of 16 tokens, an increase in KV cache length from 0 to 240 does not incur additional inference time, which might be attributable to the computational capacity characteristics of the hardware. trained to compress the KV cache losslessly. We first detail this algorithm and then describe the training methodology necessary to imbue the model with this advanced capability. ### 3.1. LoMA Generation\n\nWithin the architecture of a transformer, the KV (key-value) cache stores information from the preceding context and integrates it into the computation of attention. As the generated sequence lengthens, the memory occupied by the KV cache increases proportionally, leading to greater computational costs. Our proposed method, Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), introduces an efficient computation step within the generation process to execute highratio lossless compression on the KV-cache. This significantly curtails storage and computational resource usage. LoMA functions with a defined compression ratio $c$ and a target compressed length $t$. Within the enhanced autoregressive generation framework, once the model accumulates a KV cache spanning $t c$ tokens, LoMA model compresses it to a fixed length $t$, as illustrated in Fig1 (b). This compression is achieved through the following steps:\n\n1. The model employs a standard autoregressive generation process to produce a sequence of $t c$ tokens, yielding a KV cache of corresponding length. This particular subset of tokens forms the reading zone, which is denoted by $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$. 2. A single inference pass is conducted on $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens with $\\mathrm{KV}_{\\text {Read }}$, which yields a condensed KV cache of length $t$. This subsequence is designated as the memory zone. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-03.jpg?height=253&width=830&top_left_y=220&top_left_x=1057)\n\nFigure 3: The top row represents the original training samples, while the bottom row shows the processed training samples used for training or fine-tuning the LoMA model. In the original training samples, we insert $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens and $t c$ ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' tokens after every $t c$ tokens. 3. The reading zone's KV cache is discarded, and following autoregressive generation proceeds utilizing the compressed KV cache from the memory zone.\n```\n\n#### 2. Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/25 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10323-10333, 2023.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

While FastTTTLinear addresses some of these challenges through test-time training capabilities, it still faces limitations in memory efficiency and scalability for very long sequences. The key challenges include:\n\n1. **Memory Usage**: KV cache grows linearly with sequence length, limiting the model's ability to process long sequences\n2. **Computational Overhead**: Processing long sequences requires significant computational resources\n3. **Information Preservation**: Existing compression methods often lose important information\n4. **Test-Time Adaptation**: Need to maintain test-time training capabilities while improving efficiency\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n1. **Memory Management**:\n   - Standard KV cache requires storing full attention history\n   - Memory requirements grow linearly with sequence length\n   - Limited ability to handle very long sequences\n\n2. **Computational Efficiency**:\n   - Full attention computation becomes expensive for long sequences\n   - Test-time training adds computational overhead\n   - Need for more efficient processing methods\n\n3. **Information Quality**:\n   - Traditional compression methods often lose important context\n   - Difficulty in maintaining model expressiveness with compressed representations\n   - Challenge in preserving test-time training capabilities\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nLosslessCompressedTTTLinear introduces three key innovations:\n\n1. **Lossless KV Cache Compression**:\n   - Integrate LoMA-inspired compression for efficient memory usage\n   - Maintain information quality through lossless compression\n   - Enable processing of longer sequences\n\n2. **Hierarchical Memory Organization**:\n   - Multi-level memory structure for efficient information storage\n   - Dynamic memory updates for test-time adaptation\n   - Balanced local and global information processing\n\n3. **Dynamic Parameter Adaptation**:\n   - Efficient parameter updates during test-time training\n   - Adaptive compression ratios based on sequence characteristics\n   - Optimized computation paths for different sequence lengths\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\n1. **Integrate Lossless Compression**:\n   - Add compression module for KV cache\n   - Implement dynamic compression ratio selection\n   - Maintain test-time training compatibility\n\n2. **Implement Hierarchical Memory**:\n   - Design multi-level memory structure\n   - Enable efficient memory updates\n   - Optimize information flow\n\n3. **Add Dynamic Parameter Adaptation**:\n   - Implement adaptive parameter updates\n   - Optimize for different sequence lengths\n   - Maintain model expressiveness\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.
