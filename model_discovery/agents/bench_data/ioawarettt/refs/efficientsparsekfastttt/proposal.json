Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models.

Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression \n\nTianyu Fu ${ }^{1,2, *}$ Haofeng Huang ${ }^{1,2, *}$, Xuefei Ning ${ }^{1, *}$, Genghan Zhang ${ }^{3}$, Boju Chen ${ }^{1}$,<br>Tianqi Wu ${ }^{1,2}$, Hongyi Wang ${ }^{1,2}$, Zixiao Huang ${ }^{1,2}$, Shiyao $\\mathbf{L i}^{1,2}$,<br>Shengen Yan ${ }^{1,2}$, Guohao Dai ${ }^{2,4}$, Huazhong Yang ${ }^{1}$, Yu Wang ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ Tsinghua University ${ }^{2}$ Infinigence-AI ${ }^{3}$ Stanford University ${ }^{4}$ Shanghai Jiao Tong University\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Mixture of Sparse Attention, Grouped Query Attention, Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

We consider generalizations of this problem: mixtures of linear regressions, and mixtures of linear classifiers, where the goal is to recover supports of multiple sparse vectors using only a small number of possibly noisy linear, and 1-bit measurements respectively. The key challenge is that the measurements from different vectors are randomly mixed. Both of these problems have also received attention recently. In mixtures of linear classifiers, the observations correspond to the side of queried hyperplane a random unknown vector lies in, whereas in mixtures of linear regressions we observe the projection of a random unknown vector on the queried hyperplane. The primary step in recovering the unknown vectors from the mixture is to first identify the support of all the individual component vectors. In this work, we study the number of measurements sufficient for recovering the supports of all the component vectors in a mixture in both these models. We provide algorithms that use a number of measurements polynomial in $k, \\log n$ and quasi-polynomial in $\\ell$, to recover the support of all the $\\ell$ unknown vectors in the mixture with high probability when each individual component is a $k$-sparse $n$-dimensional vector.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates the superiority of selecting multiple experts and proposes a computation-efficient approach called merging Experts into One (MEO), which reduces the computation cost to that of a single expert.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling the size of language models usually leads to remarkable advancements in NLP tasks. But it often comes with a price of growing computational cost. Although a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) can reduce the cost by activating a small subset of parameters (e.g., one expert) for each input, its computation escalates significantly if increasing the number of activated experts, limiting its practical utility. Can we retain the advantages of adding more experts without substantially increasing the computational costs? In this paper, we first demonstrate the superiority of selecting multiple experts and then propose a computation-efficient approach called \\textbf{\\texttt{Merging Experts into One}} (MEO), which reduces the computation cost to that of a single expert. Extensive experiments show that MEO significantly improves computational efficiency, e.g., FLOPS drops from 72.0G of vanilla MoE to 28.6G (MEO). Moreover, we propose a token-level attention block that further enhances the efficiency and performance of token-level MEO, e.g., 83.3\\% (MEO) vs. 82.6\\% (vanilla MoE) average score on the GLUE benchmark.

Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper contends that the objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a mixture of low-dimensional Gaussian distributions supported on incoherent subspaces, and shows that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we contend that the objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a mixture of low-dimensional Gaussian distributions supported on incoherent subspaces. The quality of the final representation can be measured by a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally. Particularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to compress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the representation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully interpretable. Despite their simplicity, experiments show that these networks indeed learn to optimize the designed objective: they compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world vision datasets such as ImageNet, and achieve performance very close to thoroughly engineered transformers such as ViT.

Iandola, Chen Lai, Yuandong Tian, Igor Fedorov, Yunyang Xiong, Ernie Chang, Yangyang Shi, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Liangzhen Lai, Vikas Chandra*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the growing need for efficient large language models (LLMs) on mobile devices, driven by increasing cloud costs and latency concerns. We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: Grouped Query Attention*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparse Attention*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparse Attention*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparse Attention*\n\n*Yi Tay, Dara Bahri, Liu Yang, Donald Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences and is able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for learning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 301  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model\n  Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Sparse Attention*\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and\nthroughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing\nmethods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same\nsparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However,\nthis uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent\nin LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically\ntailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers.\nMoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and\ntheir scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model,\nevaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention\ncompression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some\nattention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other\nheads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show\nthat MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same\naverage attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the\nuniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models.\nMoreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models,\nreducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$\nacross two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a\n$1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7\n\\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on\nperformance.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-21T06:58:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-21T06:58:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, MQA can lead to quality\ndegradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model\njust for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing\nmulti-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original\npre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a\ngeneralization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than\none, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that\nuptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable\nspeed to MQA.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22T17:16:38Z  (*Updated: 2023-12-23T17:55:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Grouped Query Attention*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

MInference 1.0: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context LLMs via\n  Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Sparse Attention*\n\n*Huiqiang Jiang, Yucheng Li, Chengruidong Zhang, Qianhui Wu, Xufang Luo, Surin Ahn, Zhenhua Han, Amir H. Abdi, Dongsheng Li, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a\nsignificant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt\nlengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\ncomputation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens\n(i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for\nspeeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency\nwhen applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference\n(Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate\npre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique\npatterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and\nBlock-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We\ndetermine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically\nbuild sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the\npattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations\nvia our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the\npre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly\napplied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or\nadditional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks,\nincluding InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models\nincluding LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we\ndemonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x\nfor pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

Rethinking LLM Language Adaptation: A Case Study on Chinese Mixtral\n\n*From Search Query: Mixture of Sparse Attention*\n\n*Xin Yao, Yiming Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixtral, a representative sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model, has received significant attention due to its unique model design and superior performance. Based on Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1, in this paper, we propose Chinese-Mixtral and Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct with improved Chinese language abilities by adopting further pre-training and instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our Chinese-Mixtral and Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct successfully improve Chinese understanding and generation performance while retaining the original English abilities.

Group DETR: Fast DETR Training with Group-Wise One-to-Many Assignment\n\n*From Search Query: Grouped Query Attention*\n\n*Jingdong Wang, Errui Ding, Junyu Han, Haocheng Feng, Kun Yao, Shan Zhang, Jian Wang, Gang Zeng, Xiaokang Chen, Qiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Detection transformer (DETR) relies on one-to-one assignment, assigning one ground-truth object to one prediction, for end-to-end detection without NMS post-processing. It is known that one-to-many assignment, assigning one ground-truth object to multiple predictions, succeeds in detection methods such as Faster R-CNN and FCOS. While the naive one-to-many assignment does not work for DETR, and it remains challenging to apply one-to-many assignment for DETR training. In this paper, we introduce Group DETR, a simple yet efficient DETR training approach that introduces a group-wise way for one-to-many assignment. This approach involves using multiple groups of object queries, conducting one-to-one assignment within each group, and performing decoder self-attention separately. It resembles data augmentation with automatically-learned object query augmentation. It is also equivalent to simultaneously training parameter-sharing networks of the same architecture, introducing more supervision and thus improving DETR training. The inference process is the same as DETR trained normally and only needs one group of queries without any architecture modification. Group DETR is versatile and is applicable to various DETR variants. The experiments show that Group DETR significantly speeds up the training convergence and improves the performance of various DETR-based models.

It adapts to varying input sizes and can be integrated into existing models to reduce computational overhead.\n  - As described in the paper \"MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression\" by Fu et al., MoA uses an offline search scheme to apply static sparse patterns across different attention heads. However, it has been compared and outperformed by more dynamic methods like SeerAttention in terms of efficiency and performance.\n\n## Grouped Query Attention (GQA)\n\n- **GQA** reduces the number of key-value pairs by grouping query heads, leading to significant memory and computation savings.\n  - While the specific paper on GQA is not detailed in the provided sources, the concept aligns with reducing computational complexity. Integrating GQA into FastTTTLinear could further enhance efficiency without major architectural changes.\n\n## Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n- **SeerAttention** is a more recent and dynamic sparse attention method that learns intrinsic sparse attention directly from the data. It outperforms MoA and MInference in most cases, especially in terms of efficiency and maintaining model accuracy.\n  - SeerAttention adapts to the dynamic and input-dependent nature of attention sparsity, allowing it to harness sparsity more effectively. This method is particularly promising for long-context language models and could be a better candidate for integration into FastTTTLinear or Conv GAU.\n\n## Integration and Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Compatibility and Modifications**: Integrating MoA or SeerAttention into FastTTTLinear would require modifying the attention mechanism to support multiple sparse patterns. For SeerAttention, this involves learning the sparsity directly from the data, which could be more adaptive and efficient.\n- **Conv GAU Modifications**: Incorporating dynamic sparse convolutions into the Conv GAU could enhance local and global context processing efficiently. Combining convolutional operations with sparse attention patterns could balance local and global dependencies effectively.\n\n## Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **SeerAttention Over MoA**:\n   - Given that SeerAttention outperforms MoA in efficiency and performance, it might be more beneficial to integrate SeerAttention into the existing architecture. This dynamic approach to learning sparsity could provide better adaptability and efficiency gains.\n\n2. **Grouped Query Attention**:\n   - GQA offers a promising way to reduce computational complexity by grouping query heads. This could be a complementary approach to sparse attention mechanisms, enhancing overall efficiency without compromising model performance.\n\n3. **Feasibility and Performance Evaluation**:\n   - Conduct thorough feasibility studies to assess the computational and memory savings of integrating these mechanisms. Evaluate the potential impacts on model accuracy and robustness to ensure that the enhancements do not compromise performance.\n\n4. **Future Research Directions**:\n   - Explore additional dynamic sparse attention techniques and their potential integration into existing GAUs. This could involve combining different sparse attention methods or developing new architectures that leverage these efficiencies.\n\n## Relevant References\n\n- **Fu, T., Huang, H., Ning, X., et al.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths.

Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n#### 3. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality. Future research involving vision or speech could further substantiate the robustness of our method. ## E Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents SPARSEK Attention, whose goal is to address both computational and memory efficiency challenges in long-range Transformer computing. We believe our innovative attention mechanism can benefit both NLP and machine learning communities in constructing long-range foundation models. Specifically, we highlight the potential impacts of SPARSEK as follows:\n\n- Efficient Long-Range Modeling. First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. By prioritizing a subset of key-value pairs, SPARSEK attention effectively reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model performance.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1.

For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/41 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nFor linear attention, we utilize the kernelization proposed by Katharopoulos et al. [38]. Additionally, we compare our methods to recent linear attention works that employ their own architectures rather than the GPT-2 architecture: GLA [77] and RetNet [67]. As the smallest GLA and RetNet is 340 M , We modify their hyperparameters to align with our setting. Detailed hyperparameters and results of other configurations can be found in Appendix C.1. We trained all models on the OpenWebText ${ }^{3}$ corpus for 10,000 steps, varying the context length. The results are presented in Table 1. Our SPARSEK+SW method consistently outperforms all previously\n\n[^2]established efficient attention methods. Particularly, SparseK+SW offers superior performance and has lower time complexity compared to previous learnable sparse attention methods, such as hash attention. Furthermore, linear attention methods, such as Linear+SW, GLA, and RetNet, demonstrate limitations, particularly in modeling long contexts. However, when combining linear attention with SPARSEK attention, we observed additional performance gains over SPARSEK+SW, even surpassing full attention. This suggests the potential of exploring a mixture of different attention methods for more efficient modeling. ### 4.2 Fine-tuning Existing Models\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-08.jpg?height=349&width=1354&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=381)\n\nFigure 2: Perplexity on the held-out set of fine-tuned models. L denotes the training context length. We replace the standard full attention in Pythia 160M, Pythia 410M [6] and TinyLlama 1.1B [80] with our SPARSEK attention and sliding window attention. The models are then fine-tuned over a few steps to ensure compatibility with the modified attention modules. Here we only consider sliding window attention because other efficient attention methods often require additional changes of the model architecture and sliding window attention is reported to be efficient in Chen et al. [11]. In fine-tuning, the NTK-aware interpolation [7] is adopted to extend the limit of pretrained positional encodings. For the Pythia models, we utilize a $1 \\%$ sampled subset of the SlimPajama dataset ${ }^{4}$ [63] to perform fine-tuning on moderate-length settings (i.e., 4 k and 8 k ). In contrast, we use an upsampled dataset comprising long documents [25] to fine-tune the TinyLlama models on long-length settings (i.e., 8 k and 16 k ). Training hyperparameters are listed in Appendix C.2. In Figure 2, we report the perplexity on the held-out set across various levels of sparsity and training context lengths. Extending the training context length and increasing the context size generally benefit all types of attention mechanisms. When matching the KV size, our SparseK+SW attention consistently outperforms sliding window attention. For the TinyLlama models, SparseK+SW attention achieves comparable perplexity using only half the KV size required by sliding window attention. These results underscore the advantages of a more adaptable context as implemented in SparseK+SW. We further evaluate TinyLlama 1.1B, fine-tuned with an 8 k context window, across additional tasks as presented in the following sections. ### 4.3 Retrieval-based Evaluation and Length Extrapolation\n\nA common concern with sparse attention is its potential to neglect informative history. To investigate this, we evaluated our fine-tuned models on the passkey retrieval task [47], along with two baseline methods that require no training: dynamic NTK [7, 23] and LM-Infinite [33]. The results are presented in Figure 3a. It is evident that the sliding window approach fails even within the trained context length. Furthermore, among the training-free methods, NTK utilizes full attention and extends the context length by a factor of four, whereas the memory-efficient method LM-Infinite fails in extrapolation. In contrast, SPARSEK+SW is memory-efficient while maintaining performance for context lengths well beyond four times longer. We also analyze the perplexity of tokens in various positional buckets within a long context, as depicted in Figure 3b. In the language modeling task, SW demonstrates the ability to effectively manage contexts four times longer than standard models, although it is less competitive in relatively short contexts. While SPARSEK+SW fails at contexts extending to 26 k tokens, it outperforms both NTK and fine-tuned full attention models.

The choice of language is based on the fact that the training corpus of TinyLlama is primarily in English. We test all models using greedy decoding, with the evaluation context size set to 8192 . All results are presented in Table 2. Full attention offers the best performance but incurs the highest memory cost. Sliding window attention is memory-efficient; however, it results in significant performance degradation. In contrast, our SPARSEK+SW attention not only demonstrates strong performance but also achieves high memory efficiency. Notably, SPARSEK+SW outperforms the training-free method, NTK, and the inference-time KV cache compression method, H2O [81]. This suggests the benefits of maintaining consistency between training and inference. However, SparseK+SW underperforms fine-tuned full attention, representing a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Table 2: Results on LongBench. * denotes that the method is training-free. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ We use 512 globel (heavy-hitter) KV cache and 512 local KV cache in H2O. | Model | Single-Doc QA |  |  | Multi-Doc QA |  |  | Summarziation |  |  | Few-shot Learning |  |  | Synthetic |  | Code |  | Avg. |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| NTK $^{*}$ <br> $w=8192$ | 4.34 | 10.30 | 14.54 | 6.49 | 9.19 | 3.49 | 11.77 | 7.84 | 3.62 | 49.5 | 55.17 | 22.66 | 1.21 | 3.38 | 52.19 | 48.90 | 19.04 |\n| Full <br> $w=8192$ | 3.95 | 13.07 | 13.16 | 6.81 | 10.77 | 3.51 | 15.17 | 6.12 | 8.30 | 61.00 | 65.15 | 26.02 | 0.39 | 2.37 | 56.72 | 50.36 | 21.42 |\n| SW <br> $w=1024$ | 1.34 | 8.69 | 5.41 | 2.76 | 4.46 | 0.48 | 11.78 | 4.25 | 2.39 | 25.50 | 13.43 | 5.33 | 2.3 | 0.50 | 52.22 | 27.50 | 10.52 |\n| SparseK+SW <br> $k=w=512$ | 5.19 | 14.29 | 13.24 | 6.85 | 9.21 | 3.83 | 14.11 | 5.97 | 5.85 | 55.00 | 52.06 | 24.79 | 0.61 | 2.61 | 53.90 | 50.89 | 19.90 |\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe propose SpArSEK attention, a new approach to sparse attention that achieves both computational and memory efficiency. Within self-attention, we use an additional scoring network evaluating the importance of each key-value pair and select the top- $k$ pairs. We propose the differentiable SPARSEK operator, a relaxation of TOPK, to enable gradient-based optimization. Experiments on language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate consistent improvements compared to previous efficient attention methods. ## References\n\n[1] Joshua Ainslie, Tao Lei, Michiel de Jong, Santiago Ontan'on, Siddhartha Brahma, Yury Zemlyanskiy, David C.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2.

Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/41 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n3. Downstream Tasks on LLaMA-2-7B. We analysis six downstream tasks: BBH, PIQA, MMLU, COPA, ARCC, and AGNews. Using standard evaluation settings, MMLU was tested with 5 shots, BBH with 3 shots, and the remaining tasks with zero shots. As shown in Tab. 7, our augmented linear attention not only reduces perplexity but also improves accuracy across all tasks. Specifically, with models like FLASH, our method achieved an average accuracy improvement of $3.53 \\%$. In addition, we extend our methods to three more linear attention methods, with summarized results in Appendix H. Generation Speedups by Integrating LAs with Speculative Decoding. We benchmark the speedups of our compatible LAs with speculative decoding. As shown in Tab. 8, we test the LLaMA-7B/13B models which are adapted into a chat model format, similar to LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c). Following Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), we train Medusa heads for speculative decoding. Speed tests for the 7B and 13B models are conducted on a single A100-80GB GPU, we observe that our revised LAs are compatible with speculative decoding and approximately doubled the speed. Table 9. Comparison of our method with the integration of FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) and Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b). | Methods | Total Latency | Attention | FFNs | Others |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| FLASH + Medusa | 137.2 ms | 119.7 ms | 8.2 ms | 9.3 ms |\n| Ours Aug. LA | $49.7 \\mathrm{~ms}(\\mathbf{- 6 4 \\%})$ | 32.2 ms | 8.2 ms | 9.3 ms |\n\n### 5.3. Ablation Study\n\nComparison with Direct Integration. To verify the effectiveness of our causal and compatible augmentation techniques, we compare them with the direct integration of previous linear attention FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) and the speculative decoding method Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b). As shown in Tab. 9, our method applied to LLaMA-2-7B models on A100 GPUs for a single batch of speculative decoding ( 64 speculated tokens and 42 sequence candidates), achieves a $64 \\%$ reduction in total latency compared to the direct integration, while also reducing QKV memory requirements by $75 \\%$ from 0.4 GB to 0.1 GB . Our techniques outperform direct integration because standard implementations, even with linear attention like FLASH and speculative decoding like Medusa, face two key limitations without our augmentations: (1) slow sequencebased decoding and (2) lack of optimizations such as shared cumulative sum (cumsum) and key-value (KV) states for batch processing. Conventional strategies for compatible KV caching rely on sequence-based decoding, assigning distinct KV caches to each speculated sequence candidate, as shown in Fig. 7. This results in unnecessary computational effort and memory inefficiency since candidates with identical prefixes are processed separately. In contrast, our method addresses these issues by ensuring identical prefixes are computed only once, mitigating these issues with timedependent causal and compatible augmentation in linear attention and speculative decoding. Our LA Speedups. We benchmarked the training speed of FLASH using both the original attention and our augmented LAs, with a batch size of 1 , on a single A100-40G GPU. Our results show that the augmented LAs significantly improve training speed. For sequence lengths of 4 K and 8 K , they are $1.52 \\times$ and $2.94 \\times$ faster, respectively. FLASH with augmented LAs takes 1.05 seconds and 1.95 seconds per training step for 4 K and 8 K sequences, compared to 1.60 seconds and 5.74 seconds with the original attention. The group size in FLASH was consistently set to 256. Extend to Longer Sequence. We fine-tuned LLaMA-27 B to extend its sequence length from 4 K to 8 K using our augmented LAs, following LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c) setting on the RedPajama dataset. For a fair comparison, we used only the local attention in LongLora, maintaining a block size of 256 . Our augmented LAs reduced perplexity from 15.29 to 13.86 , demonstrating their effectiveness in handling longer sequences. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nThis paper presents the first empirical analysis of linearized autoregressive LLMs, revealing significant limitations of existing linear attention methods in effectively handling masked attention and integration with speculative decoding. To address these challenges, we introduced an approach that combines effective local augmentation with seamless compatibility for speculative decoding. Our experiments across a range of LLMs consistently demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains. Notably, we achieve up to a 6.67 perplexity reduction and up to $2 \\times$ speedups in generation compared to existing linear attention methods. Our work paves the way for more efficient training and deployment of powerful autoregressive LLMs, especially for long-sequence applications. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPCN program (Award number: 1934767) and the CoCoSys, one of the seven centers in JUMP 2.0, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA.

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's GPT- 3 with its 175 billion parameters, have underscored the significant data and computational power required for such technologies. Training models of this scale incur substantial costs, both financially and environmentally. For instance, the cost necessary to train GPT-3 could exceed 4 million equivalent GPU hours (Brown et al., 2020), and the carbon footprint of training a single Transformer model might rival the lifetime emissions of five average American cars (Strubell et al., 2019). Addressing the challenges of efficient training and serving of LLMs is therefore not only a technical imperative but also an environmental and ethical necessity. Societal Consequences. The success of this project in enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs will have far-reaching implications, especially in processing long sequences commonly encountered in document handling. Our\nefforts are set to substantially influence various societal and economic sectors. The enhanced efficiency of LLMs promises transformative changes in diverse applications ranging from document summarization and question answering to personal digital assistants, security, and augmented reality. The development and exploration of linearized LLMs mark a pivotal progress in rendering these models both more accessible and environmentally sustainable. ## References\n\nAgrawal, A., Kedia, N., Panwar, A., Mohan, J., Kwatra, N., Gulavani, B.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes.

We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention implementation\"*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

For instance, no paper using neural networks was published during the Net-flix Prize apart from Salakhutdinov et al's work on Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) [14].

Nonetheless, sparse inputs are critical for collaborative filtering. In this paper, we introduce a neural network architecture which computes a non-linear matrix factorization from sparse rating inputs. We show experimentally on the movieLens and jester dataset that our method performs as well as the best collaborative filtering algorithms. We provide an implementation of the algorithm as a reusable plugin for Torch [4], a popular neural network framework.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 158  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention implementation\"*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. SODA: Robust Training of Test-Time Data Adaptors\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\"*\n\n*Zige Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Zhen Fang, Long Lan, Wenjing Yang, Bo Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** P pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) is proposed, which leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction and can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting models deployed to test distributions can mitigate the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts. However, privacy concerns may render model parameters inaccessible. One promising approach involves utilizing zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) to train a data adaptor to adapt the test data to fit the deployed models. Nevertheless, the data adaptor trained with ZOO typically brings restricted improvements due to the potential corruption of data features caused by the data adaptor. To address this issue, we revisit ZOO in the context of test-time data adaptation. We find that the issue directly stems from the unreliable estimation of the gradients used to optimize the data adaptor, which is inherently due to the unreliable nature of the pseudo-labels assigned to the test data. Based on this observation, we propose pseudo-label-robust data adaptation (SODA) to improve the performance of data adaptation. Specifically, SODA leverages high-confidence predicted labels as reliable labels to optimize the data adaptor with ZOO for label prediction. For data with low-confidence predictions, SODA encourages the adaptor to preserve data information to mitigate data corruption. Empirical results indicate that SODA can significantly enhance the performance of deployed models in the presence of distribution shifts without requiring access to model parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\"*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient attention\"*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient attention\"*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention implementation\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Efficient Long-Range Transformers: You Need to Attend More, but Not\n  Necessarily at Every Layer\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention implementation\"*\n\n*Qingru Zhang, Dhananjay Ram, Cole Hawkins, Sheng Zha, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across\nvarious natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention\nmechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence.\nHowever, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost -\nquadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long\nsequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used\nto improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has\nlimited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies\nin long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an\neasy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically,\nMASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies,\nbut only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only\nemploys sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments\non natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only\nMASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to\nvanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing\ncomputational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness\nof continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts\ndownstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-19T03:32:05Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-19T03:32:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Breaking MLPerf Training: A Case Study on Optimizing BERT\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\"*\n\n*Yongdeok Kim, Jaehyung Ahn, Myeongwoo Kim, Changin Choi, Heejae Kim, Narankhuu Tuvshinjargal, Seungwon Lee, Yanzi Zhang, Yuan Pei, Xiongzhan Linghu, Jingkun Ma, Lin Chen, Yuehua Dai, Sungjoo Yoo*\n\n**Abstract:** Speeding up the large-scale distributed training is challenging in that it\nrequires improving various components of training including load balancing,\ncommunication, optimizers, etc. We present novel approaches for fast\nlarge-scale training of BERT model which individually ameliorates each\ncomponent thereby leading to a new level of BERT training performance. Load\nbalancing is imperative in distributed BERT training since its training\ndatasets are characterized by samples with various lengths. Communication cost,\nwhich is proportional to the scale of distributed training, needs to be hidden\nby useful computation. In addition, the optimizers, e.g., ADAM, LAMB, etc.,\nneed to be carefully re-evaluated in the context of large-scale distributed\ntraining. We propose two new ideas, (1) local presorting based on dataset\nstratification for load balancing and (2) bucket-wise gradient clipping before\nallreduce which allows us to benefit from the overlap of gradient computation\nand synchronization as well as the fast training of gradient clipping before\nallreduce. We also re-evaluate existing optimizers via hyperparameter\noptimization and utilize ADAM, which also contributes to fast training via\nlarger batches than existing methods. Our proposed methods, all combined, give\nthe fastest MLPerf BERT training of 25.1 (22.3) seconds on 1,024 NVIDIA A100\nGPUs, which is 1.33x (1.13x) and 1.57x faster than the other top two (one)\nsubmissions to MLPerf v1.1 (v2.0).

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient attention\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Variations on GLU are possible, using different nonlinear (or even linear) functions in place of sigmoid.

Sparse Sinkhorn Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention implementation\"*\n\n*Da-Cheng Juan, Yi Tay, Liu Yang, Donald Metzler, Dara Bahri*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Sparse Sinkhorn Attention, a new efficient and sparse method for learning to attend. Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Joint Optimization of Class-Specific Training- and Test-Time Data Augmentation in Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\"*\n\n*Ben Glocker, Chen Qin, Qi Dou, Konstantinos Kamnitsas, Zeju Li*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents an effective and general data augmentation framework for medical image segmentation. We adopt a computationally efficient and data-efficient gradient-based meta-learning scheme to explicitly align the distribution of training and validation data which is used as a proxy for unseen test data. We improve the current data augmentation strategies with two core designs. First, we learn class-specific training-time data augmentation (TRA) effectively increasing the heterogeneity within the training subsets and tackling the class imbalance common in segmentation. Second, we jointly optimize TRA and test-time data augmentation (TEA), which are closely connected as both aim to align the training and test data distribution but were so far considered separately in previous works. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on four medical image segmentation tasks across different scenarios with two state-of-the-art segmentation models, DeepMedic and nnU-Net. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed data augmentation framework can significantly and consistently improve the segmentation performance when compared to existing solutions.

Revisiting Distributed Synchronous SGD\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\"*\n\n*Samy Bengio, Rajat Monga, Rafal Jozefowicz, Jianmin Chen, Xinghao Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed training of deep learning models on large-scale training data is\ntypically conducted with asynchronous stochastic optimization to maximize the\nrate of updates, at the cost of additional noise introduced from asynchrony. In\ncontrast, the synchronous approach is often thought to be impractical due to\nidle time wasted on waiting for straggling workers. We revisit these\nconventional beliefs in this paper, and examine the weaknesses of both\napproaches.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-efficient attention\"*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

It uses a customized FlashAttention kernel to efficiently obtain block-level attention map ground truth, which is crucial for scalable learning of sparse attention. This approach shows significant speedup over dense baseline methods, especially at high context lengths and sparsity ratios.\n\n## Test-Time Training Optimization Techniques\n- **SeerAttention** also discusses the adaptability of its mechanism during fine-tuning, where both the gate and weights of the original model are jointly optimized. This allows for effective adaptation to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios, which is beneficial for test-time training optimization.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Architectures\n- **SeerAttention** employs block-level sparsity, which effectively balances accuracy and speedup. This block-sparse pattern reduces I/O and computation by skipping unimportant blocks, making it highly memory-efficient.\n- The **Diff Transformer** uses a differential attention mechanism that promotes sparse attention patterns, reducing the allocation of attention scores to irrelevant context. This approach also reduces activation outliers, potentially enabling lower-bit quantization without a performance drop.\n\n## Empirical Comparisons of Sparse Attention Methods\n- **SeerAttention** is compared against state-of-the-art sparse attention methods like MoA and Minference. It outperforms these methods in post-training and long-context fine-tuning, maintaining near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Sparse Attention in Existing Models\n- **SeerAttention** can be integrated into existing models by augmenting the conventional attention with a learnable gate. This gate adaptively selects significant blocks in the attention map, allowing for seamless integration without significant changes to the model architecture.\n- **Diff Transformer** can be directly implemented using existing FlashAttention kernels, making it easy to integrate into current models.\n\n## Performance Optimization Techniques for Attention Mechanisms\n- **SeerAttention** and **Diff Transformer** both focus on reducing noise and promoting sparse attention patterns. **SeerAttention** uses a learnable gate to adaptively identify important blocks, while **Diff Transformer** calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps, canceling out noise.\n\n## Cache Management Strategies for Sparse Attention\n- The use of block-sparse patterns in **SeerAttention** is particularly beneficial for cache management, as it reduces the number of memory reads/writes and optimizes IO-aware computation.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration of Sparse Attention\n- **SeerAttention** and similar mechanisms can be accelerated using customized CUDA kernels, which are essential for actual speedup and efficient memory access patterns.\n\n## Practical Considerations for Sparse Attention Deployment\n- **SeerAttention** and **Diff Transformer** both highlight the importance of balancing sparsity and model expressiveness. They also emphasize the need for careful initialization strategies and layer normalization to ensure training stability.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Block-Sparse Attention**: Both **SeerAttention** and the analysis note emphasize the importance of block-sparse patterns for efficient memory usage and IO-aware computation. This approach is crucial for optimizing memory access and reducing computational overhead.\n\n- **IO-Aware Design**: The use of tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, as mentioned in the context of FlashAttention, is a key strategy for optimizing IO-aware design and improving performance.\n\n- **Dynamic Pruning**: While not directly discussed in the provided sources, dynamic pruning approaches, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be integrated with sparse attention mechanisms to further optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models, particularly in terms of sparse attention mechanisms and hardware-specific optimizations.\n",

Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications. Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/48 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Significant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to fine-tune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control fine-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting non-homogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efficient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input. We demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is also faster, with similar results on an OCR task.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4. Linearizing Transformer with Key-Value Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Yizhe Zhang, Deng Cai*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient transformer variants with linear time complexity have been developed to mitigate the quadratic computational overhead of the vanilla transformer. Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and kernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer from a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence generation tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation is short. We propose Memsizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. Memsizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model. We demonstrate that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. KV-Runahead: Scalable Causal LLM Inference by Parallel Key-Value Cache Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Minsik Cho, Mohammad Rastegari, Devang Naik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase of LLM inference, and proposes context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Model or LLM inference has two phases, the prompt (or prefill) phase to output the first token and the extension (or decoding) phase to the generate subsequent tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. The key observation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt phase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache and minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT). Dual-purposing the KV-cache scheme has two main benefits. First, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the causal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically. Second, since it already exists for the extension phase, KV-Runahead is easy to implement. We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT. Compared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential parallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via all-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead can offer over 1.4x and 1.6x speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Delft, Baptiste Bellot-Gurlet, Taylor Mordan, Alexandre Alahi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing ofine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data is introduced, indicating that storing and exploiting extra information, in addition to model parameters, can be a promising direction towards robust test- time adaptation.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time training (TTT) through self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm to tackle distributional shifts. Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks. Our result indicates that storing and exploiting extra information, in addition to model parameters, can be a promising direction towards robust test-time adaptation.

Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit\n  Selection\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention transformer\"*\n\n*Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Qi Su, Xu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art\nperformances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention\nis able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction\nof irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a\nnovel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse\nTransformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global\ncontext through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive\nexperimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer\nvision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and\nlanguage modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse\nTransformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse\nattention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse\nattention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention transformer\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Data Selection for Language Models via Importance Resampling\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Sang Michael Xie, Shibani Santurkar, Tengyu Ma, Percy Liang*\n\n**Abstract:** Selecting a suitable pretraining dataset is crucial for both general-domain\n(e.g., GPT-3) and domain-specific (e.g., Codex) language models (LMs). We\nformalize this problem as selecting a subset of a large raw unlabeled dataset\nto match a desired target distribution given unlabeled target samples. Due to\nthe scale and dimensionality of the raw text data, existing methods use simple\nheuristics or require human experts to manually curate data. Instead, we extend\nthe classic importance resampling approach used in low-dimensions for LM data\nselection. We propose Data Selection with Importance Resampling (DSIR), an\nefficient and scalable framework that estimates importance weights in a reduced\nfeature space for tractability and selects data with importance resampling\naccording to these weights. We instantiate the DSIR framework with hashed\nn-gram features for efficiency, enabling the selection of 100M documents from\nthe full Pile dataset in 4.5 hours. To measure whether hashed n-gram features\npreserve the aspects of the data that are relevant to the target, we define KL\nreduction, a data metric that measures the proximity between the selected\npretraining data and the target on some feature space. Across 8 data selection\nmethods (including expert selection), KL reduction on hashed n-gram features\nhighly correlates with average downstream accuracy (r=0.82). When selecting\ndata for continued pretraining on a specific domain, DSIR performs comparably\nto expert curation across 8 target distributions. When pretraining\ngeneral-domain models (target is Wikipedia and books), DSIR improves over\nrandom selection and heuristic filtering baselines by 2-2.5% on the GLUE\nbenchmark.

MATES: Model-Aware Data Selection for Efficient Pretraining with Data\n  Influence Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Zichun Yu, Spandan Das, Chenyan Xiong*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretraining data selection has the potential to improve language model\npretraining efficiency by utilizing higher-quality data from massive web data\ncorpora. Current data selection methods, which rely on either hand-crafted\nrules or larger reference models, are conducted statically and do not capture\nthe evolving data preferences during pretraining. In this paper, we introduce\nmodel-aware data selection with data influence models (MATES), where a data\ninfluence model continuously adapts to the evolving data preferences of the\npretraining model and then selects the data most effective for the current\npretraining progress. Specifically, we fine-tune a small data influence model\nto approximate oracle data preference signals collected by locally probing the\npretraining model and to select data accordingly for the next pretraining\nstage. Experiments on Pythia and the C4 dataset demonstrate that MATES\nsignificantly outperforms random data selection on extensive downstream tasks\nin both zero- and few-shot settings. It doubles the gains achieved by recent\ndata selection approaches that leverage larger reference models and reduces the\ntotal FLOPs required to reach certain performances by half. Further analysis\nvalidates the ever-changing data preferences of pretraining models and the\neffectiveness of our data influence models to capture them.

FTFT: Efficient and Robust Fine-Tuning by Transferring Training Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\"*\n\n*Yupei Du, Albert Gatt, Dong Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the massive success of fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models\n(PLMs), they remain susceptible to out-of-distribution input. Dataset\ncartography is a simple yet effective dual-model approach that improves the\nrobustness of fine-tuned PLMs. It involves fine-tuning a model on the original\ntraining set (i.e. reference model), selecting a subset of important training\ninstances based on the training dynamics, and fine-tuning again only on these\nselected examples (i.e. main model). However, this approach requires\nfine-tuning the same model twice, which is computationally expensive for large\nPLMs. In this paper, we show that (1) training dynamics are highly transferable\nacross model sizes and pre-training methods, and that (2) fine-tuning main\nmodels using these selected training instances achieves higher training\nefficiency than empirical risk minimization (ERM). Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach: Fine-Tuning by\ntransFerring Training dynamics (FTFT). Compared with dataset cartography, FTFT\nuses more efficient reference models and aggressive early stopping. FTFT\nachieves robustness improvements over ERM while lowering the training cost by\nup to $\\sim 50\\%$.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-10T12:53:48Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-29T23:53:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention transformer\"*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention transformer\"*\n\n*Mohammad Saffar, David Grangier, Ashish Vaswani, Aurko Roy*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to $O\\left(n^{1.5}d\\right)$ from $O\\left(n^2d\\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and hidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Slide-Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Local Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Zhuofan Xia, Tianzhu Ye, Xuran Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the recent progress of Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global contexts. However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks.

SnapKV: LLM Knows What You are Looking for Before Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient key-value selection\"*\n\n*Deming Chen, Patrick Lewis, Tianle Cai, Hanchen Ye, Acyr Locatelli, Bharat Venkitesh, Bowen Yang, Yingbing Huang, Yuhong Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in processing extensive contexts, with the Key-Value (KV) cache playing a vital role in enhancing their performance. However, the growth of the KV cache in response to increasing input length poses challenges to memory and time efficiency. To address this problem, this paper introduces SnapKV, an innovative and fine-tuning-free approach that efficiently minimizes KV cache size while still delivering comparable performance in real-world applications. We discover that each attention head in the model consistently focuses on specific prompt attention features during generation. Meanwhile, this robust pattern can be obtained from an 'observation' window located at the end of the prompts. Drawing on this insight, SnapKV automatically compresses KV caches by selecting clustered important KV positions for each attention head. Our approach significantly reduces the growing computational overhead and memory footprint when processing long input sequences. Specifically, SnapKV achieves a consistent decoding speed with a 3.6x increase in generation speed and an 8.2x enhancement in memory efficiency compared to the baseline when processing inputs of 16K tokens. At the same time, it maintains comparable performance to the baseline models across 16 long sequence datasets. Moreover, SnapKV can process up to 380K context tokens on a single A100-80GB GPU using HuggingFace implementation with minor changes, exhibiting only a negligible accuracy drop in the Needle-in-a-Haystack test. Further comprehensive studies suggest SnapKV's potential for practical applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-22\n\n\n\n#### 5. Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\"*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 6. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training\"*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on sparse attention mechanisms, efficient key-value pair selection, test-time training, and other related aspects, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n- The paper on \"Transformers Can Represent n-gram Language Models\" highlights that transformer LMs using hard or sparse attention mechanisms can exactly represent any n-gram LM, which is a significant step in understanding the probabilistic representational capacity of transformers.\n- The \"Differential Transformer\" introduces a novel sparse attention mechanism that computes the difference between two separate softmax attention maps, canceling out noise and promoting sparse attention patterns. This approach is shown to outperform standard Transformers in various settings, including long-context modeling and key information retrieval.\n\n## Efficient Key-Value Pair Selection Methods\n- The Differential Transformer's differential attention mechanism is particularly effective in selecting relevant key-value pairs by subtracting noise and focusing on pertinent context. This method reduces the attention allocated to irrelevant tokens, such as the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, and enhances the model's ability to retrieve key information.\n\n## Test-Time Training with Sparse Attention\n- While the sources do not explicitly discuss test-time training with sparse attention, the Differential Transformer's design suggests it could be compatible with test-time training due to its ability to adapt to relevant context dynamically. This adaptability could be leveraged to improve the model's performance during test-time training by focusing on the most relevant information.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Attention Mechanisms\n- The paper on \"Extra Global Attention Designation Using Keyword Detection in Sparse Transformer Architectures\" proposes a method to selectively increase global attention in sparse transformers, which can help in optimizing memory usage by focusing attention on critical keywords rather than the entire context.\n- The work on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware-efficient approach using memristor-based in-memory computing, which significantly reduces power consumption and latency for matrix operations involved in attention mechanisms.\n\n## Dynamic Token Selection in Transformers\n- The Differential Transformer's mechanism inherently involves dynamic token selection by adjusting attention weights based on the difference between two softmax attention maps. This dynamic selection helps in mitigating hallucinations and improving in-context learning.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Sparse Attention Implementations\n- The memristor-based accelerator for transformer self-attention provides a hardware-efficient solution, leveraging in-memory computing to perform matrix operations efficiently. This approach can be integrated into sparse attention mechanisms to enhance overall efficiency.\n\n## Comparison of Different Sparse Attention Approaches\n- The Differential Transformer is compared against standard Transformers and shows significant improvements in various tasks, including long-context modeling and key information retrieval. This comparison highlights the advantages of the differential attention mechanism over traditional softmax attention.\n\n## Impact of Sparsity on Model Performance\n- The Differential Transformer demonstrates that sparsity in attention patterns can lead to better performance in terms of accuracy, robustness to order permutation, and reduction of hallucinations. This suggests that sparse attention mechanisms can enhance model performance without compromising expressiveness.\n\n## Techniques for Maintaining Model Expressiveness with Sparse Attention\n- The Differential Transformer maintains model expressiveness by allowing attention weights to include zero or negative values, which enables the model to allocate attention more precisely to relevant tokens. This approach does not restrict the model to positive attention scores, thus preserving its expressiveness.\n\n## Methods for Efficient Long Sequence Processing\n- The Differential Transformer is shown to scale well to long contexts up to 64,000 tokens, leveraging increasing context length more effectively than standard Transformers. This makes it particularly suitable for efficient long sequence processing.\n\n### Summary for the Researcher\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: The Differential Transformer's differential attention mechanism is a promising approach for integrating sparse attention into transformer models, offering improvements in key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, and in-context learning.\n- **Efficient Key-Value Pair Selection**: The differential attention mechanism in the Differential Transformer is highly efficient in selecting relevant key-value pairs, reducing the impact of irrelevant context.\n- **Test-Time Training**: While not explicitly discussed, the adaptability of the Differential Transformer suggests potential compatibility with test-time training.\n- **Memory Optimization**: The use of memristor-based accelerators and selective global attention designation can help optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n- **Dynamic Token Selection**: The Differential Transformer's dynamic attention mechanism is beneficial for selecting relevant tokens and mitigating issues like hallucinations.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Memristor-based accelerators offer a hardware-efficient solution for sparse attention mechanisms.\n\nThese findings and techniques can help in designing an autoregressive language model that is efficient, scalable, and maintains high performance across various tasks.\n",

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization sparse attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

We present VARS, Visual Attention from Recurrent Sparse reconstruction, a new attention formulation built on two prominent features of the human visual attention mechanism: recurrency and sparsity. Related features are grouped together via recurrent connections between neurons, with salient objects emerging via sparse regularization. VARS adopts an attractor network with recurrent connections that converges toward a stable pattern over time. Network layers are represented as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), formulating attention as a recurrent attractor network that equivalently optimizes the sparse reconstruction of input using a dictionary of\"templates\"encoding underlying patterns of data. We show that self-attention is a special case of VARS with a single-step optimization and no sparsity constraint. VARS can be readily used as a replacement for self-attention in popular vision transformers, consistently improving their robustness across various benchmarks.

Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper contends that the objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a mixture of low-dimensional Gaussian distributions supported on incoherent subspaces, and shows that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we contend that the objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a mixture of low-dimensional Gaussian distributions supported on incoherent subspaces. The quality of the final representation can be measured by a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally. Particularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to compress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the representation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully interpretable. Despite their simplicity, experiments show that these networks indeed learn to optimize the designed objective: they compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world vision datasets such as ImageNet, and achieve performance very close to thoroughly engineered transformers such as ViT.

Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention stability\"*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Long-range Sequence Modeling with Predictable Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention stability\"*\n\n*Yimeng Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Mei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling, which remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been shown to be an effective approach for capturing global context dependencies in sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic complexity in time and memory usage. Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Learning Sparse Prototypes for Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*Junxian He, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Graham Neubig*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel generative model that automatically learns a \\emph{sparse} prototype support set that achieves strong language modeling performance and is able to capture semantics and syntax at different granularity as the authors vary the sparsity of prototype selection.\n\n**Abstract:** Prototype-driven text generation uses non-parametric models that first choose from a library of sentence \"prototypes\" and then modify the prototype to generate the output text. While effective, these methods are inefficient at test time as a result of needing to store and index the entire training corpus. Further, existing methods often require heuristics to identify which prototypes to reference at training time. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model that automatically learns a \\emph{sparse} prototype support set that, nonetheless, achieves strong language modeling performance. This is achieved by (1) imposing a sparsity-inducing prior on the prototype selection distribution, and (2) utilizing amortized variational inference to \\emph{learn} a prototype retrieval function. In experiments, our model outperforms previous prototype-driven language models while achieving up to a 1000x memory reduction, as well as a 1000x speed-up at test time. More interestingly, we show that the learned prototypes are able to capture semantics and syntax at different granularity as we vary the sparsity of prototype selection, and that certain sentence attributes can be controlled by specifying the prototype for generation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Canonical 3D Deformer Maps: Unifying parametric and non-parametric methods for dense weakly-supervised category reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*David Novotn\u00fd, Roman Shapovalov, A.

Our method builds in a novel way on concepts from parametric deformation models, non-parametric 3D reconstruction, and canonical embeddings, combining their individual advantages. In particular, it learns to associate each image pixel with a deformation model of the corresponding 3D object point which is canonical, i.e. intrinsic to the identity of the point and shared across objects of the category. The result is a method that, given only sparse 2D supervision at training time, can, at test time, reconstruct the 3D shape and texture of objects from single views, while establishing meaningful dense correspondences between object instances. It also achieves state-of-the-art results in dense 3D reconstruction on public in-the-wild datasets of faces, cars, and birds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. S2-Attention: Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization sparse attention\"*\n\n*Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Liliang Ren, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention, which selectively attends to a subset of tokens in the\ncontext was supposed to be efficient. However, its theoretical reduction in\nFLOPs has rarely translated into wall-clock speed-up over its dense attention\ncounterparts due to the lack of hardware-aware optimizations like\nFlashAttention. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether sparse attention can\nmaintain the model's quality at a scale of today's large language models (LLMs)\nand how. This paper presents Sparsely-Sharded(S2) Attention, a Triton library\nthat provides kernel optimization for sparse attention customizable at both\nper-head and per-context-range levels. S2-Attention enables the exploration of\nnovel and high-performance sparse attention techniques, which we demonstrate\nthrough extensive ablations across a wide range of sparse attention designs at\nvarious model scales. From these insights, we present several basic guidelines\nto design sparse attention that can achieve not only practical efficiency\nimprovements, but also strong downstream performance. To achieve high\nparallelization and optimized memory IO, sparse attention should shard the\ncontext heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a\ndifferent subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context.\nMeanwhile, we find hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention\nparticularly beneficial in practice. S2-Attention achieves wall-clock speedup\nof 8.79X, 15.87X, 25.3X compared to the strong FlashAttention-2 baseline with\nstrong downstream performance on-par with full attention and perfect retrieval\nperformance at a 128k context length. At inference, for 7B models, our model,\nwith the help of our S2-Attention kernel, achieves 4.5x speed-up compared to\ndense counterparts. S2-Attention is released with easy-to-customize APIs for\ndirect usage in Megatron and vLLM.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-25T00:27:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T18:26:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. SpAtten: Efficient Sparse Attention Architecture with Cascade Token and\n  Head Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization sparse attention\"*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhekai Zhang, Song Han*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is becoming increasingly popular in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) applications, showing superior performance than convolutional\nand recurrent architectures. However, attention becomes the compution\nbottleneck because of its quadratic computational complexity to input length,\ncomplicated data movement and low arithmetic intensity. Moreover, existing NN\naccelerators mainly focus on optimizing convolutional or recurrent models, and\ncannot efficiently support attention. In this paper, we present SpAtten, an\nefficient algorithm-architecture co-design that leverages token sparsity, head\nsparsity, and quantization opportunities to reduce the attention computation\nand memory access. Inspired by the high redundancy of human languages, we\npropose the novel cascade token pruning to prune away unimportant tokens in the\nsentence. We also propose cascade head pruning to remove unessential heads.\nCascade pruning is fundamentally different from weight pruning since there is\nno trainable weight in the attention mechanism, and the pruned tokens and heads\nare selected on the fly. To efficiently support them on hardware, we design a\nnovel top-k engine to rank token and head importance scores with high\nthroughput. Furthermore, we propose progressive quantization that first fetches\nMSBs only and performs the computation; if the confidence is low, it fetches\nLSBs and recomputes the attention outputs, trading computation for memory\nreduction.\n  Extensive experiments on 30 benchmarks show that, on average, SpAtten reduces\nDRAM access by 10.0x with no accuracy loss, and achieves 1.6x, 3.0x, 162x, 347x\nspeedup, and 1,4x, 3.2x, 1193x, 4059x energy savings over A3 accelerator,\nMNNFast accelerator, TITAN Xp GPU, Xeon CPU, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-17T18:59:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-18T18:48:38Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention stability\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention stability\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*James Lee-Thorp, Joshua Ainslie*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the\nspeed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse\nMixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and\nSuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61%\nfaster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer,\nthat marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly\ntwice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating\nthrough various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters.\nSparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models\nand offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to\ndistilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24T23:08:54Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T17:47:14Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit\n  Selection\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Qi Su, Xu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art\nperformances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention\nis able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction\nof irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a\nnovel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse\nTransformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global\ncontext through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive\nexperimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer\nvision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and\nlanguage modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse\nTransformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse\nattention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse\nattention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time.

TorchSparse: Efficient Point Cloud Inference Engine\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization sparse attention\"*\n\n*Song Han, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization sparse attention\"*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie zhou, Jiwen Lu, Benlin Liu, Wenliang Zhao, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Ranking and Classification driven Feature Learning for Person Re_identification\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention stability\"*\n\n*Zhiguang Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Person re-identification has attracted many researchers' attention for its wide application, but it is still a very challenging task because only part of the image information can be used for personnel matching. Most of current methods uses CNN to learn to embeddings that can capture semantic similarity information among data points. Many of the state-of-the-arts methods use complex network structures with multiple branches that fuse multiple features while training or testing, using classification loss, Triplet loss or a combination of the two as loss function. However, the method that using Triplet loss as loss function converges slowly, and the method in which pull features of the same class as close as possible in features space leads to poor feature stability. This paper will combine the ranking motivated structured loss, proposed a new metric learning loss function that make the features of the same class are sparsely distributed into the range of small hyperspheres and the features of different classes are uniformly distributed at a clearly angle. And adopted a new single-branch network structure that only using global feature can also get great performance. The validity of our method is verified on the Market1501 and DukeMTMC-ReID person re-identification datasets. Finally acquires 90.9% rank-1 accuracy and 80.8% mAP on DukeMTMC-reID, 95.3% rank-1 accuracy and 88.7% mAP on Market1501.

Language Models are Few-Shot Learners\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*Scott Gray, Christopher Hesse, Rewon Child, Gretchen Krueger, Ariel Herbert-Voss, Arvind Neelakantan, Sandhini Agarwal, Mark Chen, Tom B. Brown, Pranav Shyam, Nick Ryder, Mateusz Litwin, Jeffrey Wu, Ilya Sutskever, Eric Sigler, Clemens Winter, Benjamin Chess, Amanda Askell, Alec Radford, Melanie Subbiah, Jared Kaplan, Jack Clark, Dario Amodei, Tom Henighan, Sam McCandlish, Prafulla Dhariwal, Girish Sastry, Daniel M. Ziegler, Christopher Berner, Benjamin Mann, Aditya Ramesh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains on many NLP tasks and benchmarks by pre-training on a large corpus of text followed by fine-tuning on a specific task. While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Scaling Vision with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training sparse models\"*\n\n*Neil Houlsby, Daniel Keysers, Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto, Rodolphe Jenatton, Maxim Neumann, Basil Mustafa, Joan Puigcerver, Carlos Riquelme*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated Mixture of Experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated excellent scalability in Natural Language Processing. In Computer Vision, however, almost all performant networks are \"dense\", that is, every input is processed by every parameter. We present a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks. When applied to image recognition, V-MoE matches the performance of state-of-the-art networks, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time. Further, we propose an extension to the routing algorithm that can prioritize subsets of each input across the entire batch, leading to adaptive per-image compute. This allows V-MoE to trade-off performance and compute smoothly at test-time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of V-MoE to scale vision models, and train a 15B parameter model that attains 90.35% on ImageNet.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for Sparse Attention\n\n- The use of sparse attention can significantly reduce memory and computational requirements. Techniques like **FastGen** and **Sparse Sharding Attention (SSA)** optimize memory usage by selectively computing and storing only relevant attention values, reducing memory by up to 40% without losing accuracy.\n- **SeerAttention** adopts a learning-based approach to identify attention sparsity, integrating a learnable gate to select significant blocks in the attention map. This method reduces I/O and computation overhead by skipping unimportant blocks, making it efficient on modern hardware like GPUs.\n\n## Stability Analysis and Convergence Properties of Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **SeerAttention** ensures stability by learning block-level sparsity, which is integrated with FlashAttention to maintain accuracy while reducing computational overhead. The learnable gate in SeerAttention helps in adaptively identifying important blocks, ensuring that the model does not suffer from significant accuracy loss.\n- The stability of sparse attention mechanisms can also be enhanced by using residual connections, as seen in the malware detection model that combines sparse attention with residual pyramidal and depth-wise separable convolutional neural networks. This helps in improving gradient flow and preventing the vanishing gradient issue.\n\n## Integration Methods for Test-Time Training in Sparse Attention Models\n\n- Test-time training can be integrated into sparse attention models using self-supervised learning strategies. For example, turning a single unlabeled test sample into a self-supervised learning problem allows for updating model parameters before making a prediction, which can be particularly useful for adapting to new or unseen data.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different Sparse Attention Architectures\n\n- **SeerAttention** outperforms other methods like MoA and MInference in most cases, especially for longer context lengths. It achieves significant speedup compared to FlashAttention-2 while maintaining accuracy.\n- **Sparse Sharding Attention (SSA)** and **FastGen** also show improved performance over traditional attention mechanisms, with SSA providing a more generalizable approach that works across multiple models.\n- Hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention, such as **Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention**, achieve wall-clock speedup of up to 25.3X compared to dense counterparts while maintaining strong downstream performance.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Techniques for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **KV caching strategies** can be optimized using techniques like FastGen and SSA, which selectively compute and store only relevant attention values, reducing memory requirements significantly.\n- **SeerAttention** uses block-level sparsity to reduce memory and computational overhead, ensuring that only important blocks are computed and stored.\n\n## Scoring Network Architectures and Implementations\n\n- **SeerAttention** employs a scoring network and a learnable gate (Attention Gate) to adaptively identify significant blocks in the attention map. This approach allows for efficient learning of the gating network and integrates well with FlashAttention.\n- The use of a differentiable top-k mask operator in **SPARSEK Attention** enables gradient-based optimization and maintains a constant memory footprint during generation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Gradient Flow in Sparse Attention Models\n\n- The integration of residual connections in sparse attention models, as seen in the malware detection model, helps in improving gradient flow and preventing the vanishing gradient issue. This is crucial for training deeper architectures without compromising on the learning of complex features.\n\n## Adaptive Sparsity Patterns in Transformers\n\n- **SeerAttention** learns adaptive sparsity patterns rather than relying on predefined heuristics. This approach allows the model to dynamically adjust to different attention heads and input sequences, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.\n\n## Cache Management Strategies for Sparse Attention\n\n- **KV-Runahead** parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache, minimizing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) and optimizing cache management[Analysis Note].\n- **FastGen** and **SSA** optimize cache utilization by selectively computing and storing relevant attention values, reducing the overall cache size and memory constraints.\n\n## Real-World Applications and Benchmarks\n\n- The application of sparse attention in **malware detection** shows significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. The model achieves a high F1-score of 96.08% and reduces computational demands relative to conventional attention methods.\n- Benchmarks using **OpenVINO** and 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable Processors demonstrate significant performance improvements for sparse and 8-bit quantized models, highlighting the real-world applicability of these techniques.\n\nThese insights and techniques can help researchers in designing more efficient, scalable, and accurate autoregressive language models by leveraging sparse attention mechanisms, optimizing hardware usage, and ensuring stability and performance during test-time training.\n",

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 5. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention memory management\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1350  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 5.

Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Rewiring Neurons in Non-Stationary Environments\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*Zhicheng Sun, Yadong Mu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel rewiring scheme by permuting hidden neurons to be end-to-end learnable and can rearrange all available synapses to explore a large span of weight space, thereby promoting adaptivity and stability on history tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The human brain rewires itself for neuroplasticity in the presence of new tasks. We are inspired to harness this key process in continual reinforcement learning, prioritizing adaptation to non-stationary environments. In distinction to existing rewiring approaches that rely on pruning or dynamic routing, which may limit network capacity and plasticity, this work presents a novel rewiring scheme by permuting hidden neurons. Specifically, the neuron permutation is parameterized to be end-to-end learnable and can rearrange all available synapses to explore a large span of weight space, thereby promoting adaptivity. In addition, we introduce two main designs to steer the rewiring process in continual reinforcement learning: first, a multi-mode rewiring strategy is proposed which diversifies the policy and encourages exploration when encountering new environments. Secondly, to ensure stability on history tasks, the network is devised to cache each learned wiring while subtly updating its weights, allowing for retrospective recovery of any previous state appropriate for the task. Meanwhile, an alignment mechanism is curated to achieve better plasticity-stability tradeoff by jointly optimizing cached wirings and weights. Our proposed method is comprehensively evaluated on 18 continual reinforcement learning scenarios ranging from locomotion to manipulation, demonstrating its advantages over state-of-the-art competitors in performance-efficiency tradeoffs.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. A Diagnostic Study of Explainability Techniques for Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"scoring network architecture\"*\n\n*Pepa Atanasova, Jakob Grue Simonsen, Christina Lioma, Isabelle Augenstein*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent developments in machine learning have introduced models that approach\nhuman performance at the cost of increased architectural complexity. Efforts to\nmake the rationales behind the models' predictions transparent have inspired an\nabundance of new explainability techniques. Provided with an already trained\nmodel, they compute saliency scores for the words of an input instance.\nHowever, there exists no definitive guide on (i) how to choose such a technique\ngiven a particular application task and model architecture, and (ii) the\nbenefits and drawbacks of using each such technique. In this paper, we develop\na comprehensive list of diagnostic properties for evaluating existing\nexplainability techniques. We then employ the proposed list to compare a set of\ndiverse explainability techniques on downstream text classification tasks and\nneural network architectures. We also compare the saliency scores assigned by\nthe explainability techniques with human annotations of salient input regions\nto find relations between a model's performance and the agreement of its\nrationales with human ones. Overall, we find that the gradient-based\nexplanations perform best across tasks and model architectures, and we present\nfurther insights into the properties of the reviewed explainability techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-25T12:01:53Z  (*Updated: 2020-09-25T12:01:53Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Explainable CNN-attention Networks (C-Attention Network) for Automated\n  Detection of Alzheimer's Disease\n\n*From Search Query: \"scoring network architecture\"*\n\n*Ning Wang, Mingxuan Chen, K. P. Subbalakshmi*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose three explainable deep learning architectures to\nautomatically detect patients with Alzheimer`s disease based on their language\nabilities. The architectures use: (1) only the part-of-speech features; (2)\nonly language embedding features and (3) both of these feature classes via a\nunified architecture. We use self-attention mechanisms and interpretable\n1-dimensional ConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) to generate two types of\nexplanations of the model`s action: intra-class explanation and inter-class\nexplanation. The inter-class explanation captures the relative importance of\neach of the different features in that class, while the inter-class explanation\ncaptures the relative importance between the classes. Note that although we\nhave considered two classes of features in this paper, the architecture is\neasily expandable to more classes because of its modularity. Extensive\nexperimentation and comparison with several recent models show that our method\noutperforms these methods with an accuracy of 92.2% and F1 score of 0.952on the\nDementiaBank dataset while being able to generate explanations. We show by\nexamples, how to generate these explanations using attention values.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-25T02:10:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-01-08T04:43:27Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for\n  Long-Range Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention memory management\"*\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers,\nespecially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due\nto the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory\nrequirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce\nSPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome\nthese computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our\napproach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator,\nSPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby\nenabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers\nlinear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation.\nExperimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse\nattention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both\ntraining and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution\nfor effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention memory management\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have become ubiquitous in natural language\nprocessing thanks to their large capacity, innate parallelism and high\nperformance. The contextualizing component of a Transformer block is the\n$\\textit{pairwise dot-product}$ attention that has a large $\\Omega(L^2)$ memory\nrequirement for length $L$ sequences, limiting its ability to process long\ndocuments. This has been the subject of substantial interest recently, where\nmultiple approximations were proposed to reduce the quadratic memory\nrequirement using sparse attention matrices. In this work, we propose to\naugment sparse Transformer blocks with a dense attention-based $\\textit{global\nmemory}$ of length $M$ ($\\ll L$) which provides an aggregate global view of the\nentire input sequence to each position. Our augmentation has a manageable\n$O(M\\cdot(L+M))$ memory overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated with prior\nsparse solutions. Moreover, global memory can also be used for sequence\ncompression, by representing a long input sequence with the memory\nrepresentations only. We empirically show that our method leads to substantial\nimprovement on a range of tasks, including (a) synthetic tasks that require\nglobal reasoning, (b) masked language modeling, and (c) reading comprehension.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05T07:50:40Z  (*Updated: 2020-06-05T07:50:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Delta Keyword Transformer: Bringing Transformers to the Edge through\n  Dynamically Pruned Multi-Head Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*Zuzana Jel\u010dicov\u00e1, Marian Verhelst*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head self-attention forms the core of Transformer networks. However,\ntheir quadratically growing complexity with respect to the input sequence\nlength impedes their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We\naddress this challenge by proposing a dynamic pruning method, which exploits\nthe temporal stability of data across tokens to reduce inference cost. The\nthreshold-based method only retains significant differences between the\nsubsequent tokens, effectively reducing the number of multiply-accumulates, as\nwell as the internal tensor data sizes. The approach is evaluated on the Google\nSpeech Commands Dataset for keyword spotting, and the performance is compared\nagainst the baseline Keyword Transformer. Our experiments show that we can\nreduce ~80% of operations while maintaining the original 98.4% accuracy.\nMoreover, a reduction of ~87-94% operations can be achieved when only degrading\nthe accuracy by 1-4%, speeding up the multi-head self-attention inference by a\nfactor of ~7.5-16.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-20T20:59:13Z  (*Updated: 2022-03-20T20:59:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Successfully Applying the Stabilized Lottery Ticket Hypothesis to the\n  Transformer Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*Christopher Brix, Parnia Bahar, Hermann Ney*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse models require less memory for storage and enable a faster inference\nby reducing the necessary number of FLOPs. This is relevant both for\ntime-critical and on-device computations using neural networks. The stabilized\nlottery ticket hypothesis states that networks can be pruned after none or few\ntraining iterations, using a mask computed based on the unpruned converged\nmodel. On the transformer architecture and the WMT 2014 English-to-German and\nEnglish-to-French tasks, we show that stabilized lottery ticket pruning\nperforms similar to magnitude pruning for sparsity levels of up to 85%, and\npropose a new combination of pruning techniques that outperforms all other\ntechniques for even higher levels of sparsity. Furthermore, we confirm that the\nparameter's initial sign and not its specific value is the primary factor for\nsuccessful training, and show that magnitude pruning could be used to find\nwinning lottery tickets.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-04T15:17:28Z  (*Updated: 2020-07-03T15:22:02Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MobileDets: Searching for Object Detection Architectures for Mobile Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: \"scoring network architecture\"*\n\n*Bo Chen, Pieter-Jan Kindermans, Yongzhe Wang, Yunyang Xiong, Suyog Gupta, Mingxing Tan, Gabriel Bender, Berkin Akin, Vikas Singh, Hanxiao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Inverted bottleneck layers, which are built upon depthwise convolutions, have been the predominant building blocks in state-of-the-art object detection models on mobile devices. In this work, we investigate the optimality of this design pattern over a broad range of mobile accelerators by revisiting the usefulness of regular convolutions. We discover that regular convolutions are a potent component to boost the latency-accuracy trade-off for object detection on accelerators, provided that they are placed strategically in the network via neural architecture search. By incorporating regular convolutions in the search space and directly optimizing the network architectures for object detection, we obtain a family of object detection models, MobileDets, that achieve state-of-the-art results across mobile accelerators. On the COCO object detection task, MobileDets outperform MobileNetV3+SSDLite by 1.7 mAP at comparable mobile CPU inference latencies. MobileDets also outperform MobileNetV2+SSDLite by 1.9 mAP on mobile CPUs, 3.7 mAP on Google EdgeTPU, 3.4 mAP on Qualcomm Hexagon DSP and 2.7 mAP on Nvidia Jetson GPU without increasing latency. Moreover, MobileDets are comparable with the state-of-the-art MnasFPN on mobile CPUs even without using the feature pyramid, and achieve better mAP scores on both EdgeTPUs and DSPs with up to 2x speedup.

Gomez*\n\n**Abstract:** The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n\n**Conference:** attention-is-all-you-need-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. Tackling fluffy clouds: field boundaries detection using time series of S2 and/or S1 imagery\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse attention memory management\"*\n\n*John Taylor, Andrew Toovey, Chris Herrmann, Kathryn Batchelor, Jonathan Richetti, Ondrej Hlinka, Rodrigo Ibata, Peter Caccetta, Amy Parker, Roger Lawes, Dave Henry, Gonzalo Mata, Jeff Wang, Zheng-Shu Zhou, Foivos I. Diakogiannis*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate field boundary delineation is a critical challenge in digital agriculture, impacting everything from crop monitoring to resource management. Existing methods often struggle with noise and fail to generalize across varied landscapes, particularly when dealing with cloud cover in optical remote sensing. In response, this study presents a new approach that leverages time series data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery to improve performance under diverse cloud conditions, without the need for manual cloud filtering. We introduce a 3D Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for satellite image time series, incorporating a memory-efficient attention mechanism. Two models are proposed: PTAViT3D, which handles either S2 or S1 data independently, and PTAViT3D-CA, which fuses both datasets to enhance accuracy. Both models are evaluated under sparse and dense cloud coverage by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the models can effectively delineate field boundaries, even with partial (S2 or S2 and S1 data fusion) or dense cloud cover (S1), with the S1-based model providing performance comparable to S2 imagery in terms of spatial resolution. A key strength of this approach lies in its capacity to directly process cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations in a memory-efficient manner. This methodology, used in the ePaddocks product to map Australia's national field boundaries, offers a robust, scalable solution adaptable to varying agricultural environments, delivering precision and reliability where existing methods falter.

DER: Dynamically Expandable Representation for Class Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*Xuming He, Jiangwei Xie, Shipeng Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** We address the problem of class incremental learning, which is a core step towards achieving adaptive vision intelligence. In particular, we consider the task setting of incremental learning with limited memory and aim to achieve better stability-plasticity trade-off. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach that utilizes a dynamically expandable representation for more effective incremental concept modeling. Specifically, at each incremental step, we freeze the previously learned representation and augment it with additional feature dimensions from a new learnable feature extractor. This enables us to integrate new visual concepts with retaining learned knowledge. We dynamically expand the representation according to the complexity of novel concepts by introducing a channel-level mask-based pruning strategy. Moreover, we introduce an auxiliary loss to encourage the model to learn diverse and discriminate features for novel concepts. We conduct extensive experiments on the three class incremental learning benchmarks and our method consistently outperforms other methods with a large margin.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient On-Chip Learning for Optical Neural Networks Through Power-Aware Sparse Zeroth-Order Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic pruning stability\"*\n\n*David Z. Pan, Ray T. Chen, Zhoufeng Ying, Zheng Zhao, Chenghao Feng, Jiaqi Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Optical neural networks (ONNs) have demonstrated record-breaking potential in high-performance neuromorphic computing due to their ultra-high execution speed and low energy consumption. However, current learning protocols fail to provide scalable and efficient solutions to photonic circuit optimization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel on-chip learning framework to release the full potential of ONNs for power-efficient in situ training. Instead of deploying implementation-costly back-propagation, we directly optimize the device configurations with computation budgets and power constraints. We are the first to model the ONN on-chip learning as a resource-constrained stochastic noisy zeroth-order optimization problem, and propose a novel mixed-training strategy with two-level sparsity and power-aware dynamic pruning to offer a scalable on-chip training solution in practical ONN deployment. Compared with previous methods, we are the first to optimize over 2,500 optical components on chip. We can achieve much better optimization stability, 3.7x-7.6x higher efficiency, and save >90% power under practical device variations and thermal crosstalk.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LLMs) using sparse attention, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources that address the researcher's goals and analysis:\n\n## Efficient Scoring Network Architectures for Sparse Attention\n\n- The \"S2-Attention\" approach proposes a hardware-aware sparse attention strategy that shards the context heterogeneously across attention heads. Each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context, which enhances parallelization and optimized memory IO.\n- \"SeerAttention\" introduces an efficient module, AttnGate, which adaptively identifies significant blocks in the attention map and deems the rest sparse. This block-level sparsity balances accuracy and speedup, particularly in long-context fine-tuning.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- \"S2-Attention\" highlights the importance of memory access patterns and efficient memory IO. The approach ensures that sparse attention is designed to fit into SRAM for efficient computation, minimizing HBM I/O and optimizing memory access.\n- \"SeerAttention\" uses a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel that reduces I/O and computation overhead by skipping non-activated blocks. This is particularly beneficial for test-time adaptation and long-context scenarios.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Dynamic Pruning in Attention\n\n- Stability in sparse attention models is often achieved through layer normalization and careful initialization strategies. \"Sparse Linear Attention\" emphasizes the use of layer normalization with either specialized initialization or an additional gating function to ensure training stability[Analysis Note].\n- \"SeerAttention\" also ensures stability by learning block-wise attention sparsity from the model itself, which helps in maintaining model quality even with high sparsity ratios.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Sparse Attention\n\n- \"S2-Attention\" introduces a hardware-friendly sparse attention pattern that is compatible with accelerator parallelization and efficient memory access. This approach achieves significant speedup compared to dense attention baselines.\n- \"SeerAttention\" implements a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel using Triton, which efficiently reduces I/O and computation overhead, leading to a substantial speedup over traditional FlashAttention-2.\n- The use of memristor-based accelerators for sparse attention, as described in another source, shows promising results in terms of energy efficiency and latency, although it is more focused on matrix operations rather than attention mechanisms specifically.\n\n## Impact of Sparsity Patterns on Model Expressiveness\n\n- The \"S2-Attention\" and \"SeerAttention\" papers both emphasize that while sparse attention reduces computational overhead, it is crucial to ensure that the full context is preserved. This is achieved through techniques like heterogeneous context sharding and hybrid architectures that combine sparse and dense attention.\n- Maintaining model expressiveness with sparse attention involves ensuring that the union of all attention heads\u2019 shards generates the full context, a property known as Union Completeness.\n\n## Methods for Maintaining Model Quality with Sparse Attention\n\n- Hybrid architectures that combine sparse and dense attention are particularly beneficial. \"S2-Attention\" shows that requiring only 1/6 of the attention layers to be dense can achieve strong retrieval performance with minimal loss in model quality.\n- \"SeerAttention\" adapts block-level sparsity, which allows for efficient inference while maintaining high accuracy and model quality, even in long-context scenarios.\n\n## Techniques for Efficient Test-Time Updates\n\n- \"SeerAttention\" excels in long-context fine-tuning and post-training stages by adaptively learning block-wise attention sparsity. This approach enables efficient test-time updates with minimal perplexity loss and significant speedup.\n- Efficient scoring network design, such as the one proposed by \"S2-Attention,\" ensures that sparse attention can be effectively integrated with test-time training without compromising model performance.\n\n## Trade-offs Between Sparsity and Model Performance\n\n- There is a trade-off between sparsity and model performance. \"S2-Attention\" and \"SeerAttention\" both show that while sparse attention reduces computational overhead, it is crucial to balance sparsity with model expressiveness. Hybrid architectures and careful design choices are necessary to maintain strong performance.\n\n## Initialization Strategies for Sparse Attention\n\n- Proper initialization strategies are crucial for training stability. \"Sparse Linear Attention\" suggests using layer normalization with either specialized initialization or an additional gating function to ensure stable training[Analysis Note].\n- \"SeerAttention\" learns the block-wise attention sparsity from the model itself, which helps in initializing the sparse attention mechanism effectively.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Adaptation Mechanisms\n\n- \"SeerAttention\" uses a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel that reduces memory overhead by skipping non-activated blocks. This approach is memory-efficient and suitable for test-time adaptation.\n- \"S2-Attention\" ensures that sparse attention is designed to fit into SRAM for efficient computation, minimizing HBM I/O and optimizing memory access patterns.\n\nThese findings and techniques provide a comprehensive framework for improving autoregressive language model design using sparse attention, addressing efficiency, stability, and model quality while ensuring hardware-efficient implementations.\n",

Differentiable Top-\ud835\udc58 Operator\n\n- **Purpose**: Select the top-\ud835\udc58 KV pairs based on the importance scores in a differentiable manner.\n- **Implementation**:\n  - Use the SPARSEK operator as defined in the SPARSEK Attention paper.\n  - The operator allows for gradient backpropagation through the selection process.\n  - The selection mask \\( M \\) is computed as:\n    \\[\n    M_{i,j} = \\sigma\\left(c \\left(s_{i,j} - s_{(k)}^{(i)}\\right)\\right)\n    \\]\n    where \\( s_{(k)}^{(i)} \\) is the \\( k \\)-th largest score for query \\( i \\), \\( c \\) is a hyperparameter controlling the sharpness of the selection, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function.\n\n#### 3. Adjusting the Attention Computation\n\n- **Modified Attention Mechanism**:\n  - Only compute attention over the selected KV pairs.\n  - Apply the selection mask \\( M \\) to the attention scores before the softmax operation.\n- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n  - The modified attention output for query \\( i \\) is:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V)_{i} = \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{i,j} V_{j}\n    \\]\n    where:\n    \\[\n    \\alpha_{i,j} = \\frac{ \\exp\\left( (Q_{i} K_{j}^{T}) / \\sqrt{d} \\right) \\cdot M_{i,j} }{ \\sum_{l} \\exp\\left( (Q_{i} K_{l}^{T}) / \\sqrt{d} \\right) \\cdot M_{i,l} }\n    \\]\n\n#### 4. Maintaining Test-Time Training Capabilities\n\n- **Hidden State Updates**:\n  - Ensure that the scoring network and SPARSEK operator can operate on the updated hidden states during inference.\n- **Compatibility**:\n  - The modifications should integrate seamlessly with the existing TTT mechanisms in FastTTTLinear.\n\n#### 5. Addressing Numerical Stability\n\n- **Normalization Techniques**:\n  - Apply Layer Normalization or RMSNorm to stabilize the importance scores.\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**:\n  - The sharpness parameter \\( c \\) in the differentiable top-\ud835\udc58 operator needs to be carefully tuned.\n- **Activation Functions**:\n  - Use activation functions that mitigate gradient vanishing or explosion, such as LeakyReLU.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified FastTTTLinear\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom model_discovery.model.utils.modules import GAUBase\n\nclass EfficientSPARSEKFastTTTLinear(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    EfficientSPARSEKFastTTTLinear: An enhanced FastTTTLinear GAU integrating SPARSEK Attention.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, num_attention_heads=4, k_top=32, c=10.0, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.num_heads = num_attention_heads\n        assert embed_dim % self.num_heads == 0, 'embed_dim must be divisible by num_attention_heads'\n        self.head_dim = embed_dim // self.num_heads\n        self.k_top = k_top  # Number of top KV pairs to select\n        self.c = c  # Sharpness parameter for differentiable top-k operator\n\n        # Linear projections\n        self.W_Q = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_K = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_V = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # Scoring network (can be a simple feed-forward network)\n        self.score_network = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(2 * self.head_dim, self.head_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(self.head_dim, 1, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n\n        # Output projection\n        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # Normalization\n        self.norm = RMSNorm(embed_dim=self.embed_dim, block_loc=self.block_loc, kwarg_all=self.kwarg_all, **self.factory_kwargs, **self.kwarg_all)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        B, L, D = X.size()\n        H = self.num_heads\n        D_H = self.head_dim\n\n        # Linear projections\n        Q = self.W_Q(X).view(B, L, H, D_H).transpose(1, 2)  # Shape: (B, H, L, D_H)\n        K = self.W_K(X).view(B, L, H, D_H).transpose(1, 2)\n        V = self.W_V(X).view(B, L, H, D_H).transpose(1, 2)\n\n        # Compute importance scores\n        Q_expanded = Q.unsqueeze(3).expand(-1, -1, -1, L, -1)  # Shape: (B, H, L_q, L_k, D_H)\n        K_expanded = K.unsqueeze(2).expand(-1, -1, L, -1, -1)\n        QK_concat = torch.cat([Q_expanded, K_expanded], dim=-1)  # Shape: (B, H, L, L, 2 * D_H)\n\n        # Reshape for scoring network\n        QK_concat = QK_concat.reshape(B * H * L, L, 2 * D_H)\n        scores = self.score_network(QK_concat).squeeze(-1)  # Shape: (B * H * L, L)\n        scores = scores.view(B, H, L, L)\n\n        # Differentiable top-k selection\n        s_topk = torch.topk(scores, self.k_top, dim=-1)[0][:, :, :, -1:]  # k-th largest score\n        threshold = s_topk  # Shape: (B, H, L, 1)\n        M = torch.sigmoid(self.c * (scores -

The dynamic selection of informative key-value pairs per query reduces computational complexity to linear time and achieves a constant memory footprint during generation. This enhancement maintains the model's expressiveness and test-time training capabilities, potentially improving performance on long-context tasks while significantly enhancing efficiency and scalability.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Lou, C., Jia, Z., Zheng, Z., & Tu, K.
