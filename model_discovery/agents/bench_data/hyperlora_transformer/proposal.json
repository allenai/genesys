Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. HyperMixer: An MLP-based Low Cost Alternative to Transformers  (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Florian Mai, Arnaud Pannatier, Fabio Fehr, Haolin Chen, Fran\u00e7ois Marelli, F. Fleuret, J. Henderson*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2022)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks, and demonstrates that this model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural language understanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadratic complexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can be difficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer. We open-source our model for reproducibility purposes in Jax.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## References\n\nNaman Agarwal, Rohan Anil, Elad Hazan, Tomer Koren, and Cyril Zhang. 2020.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, 2020.

LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation*\n\n*Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen, Shean Wang, Yuanzhi Li, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Phillip Wallis, Yelong Shen, Edward J. Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Conference:** lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. AdaRank: Disagreement Based Module Rank Prediction for Low-rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation*\n\n*Yihe Dong*\n\n**Abstract:** With the rise of language and multimodal models of ever-increasing size, pretraining a general-purpose foundational model and adapting it to downstream tasks has become common practice. To this end, adaptation efficiency can be a critical bottleneck given the large model sizes, hence efficient finetuning methods such as LoRA have become prevalent. However, LoRA is typically applied with the same rank across all model layers, despite mounting evidence from transfer learning literature that during finetuning, later layers diverge more from pretrained weights. Inspired by the theory and observations around feature learning and module criticality, we develop a simple model disagreement based technique to predict the rank of a given module relative to the other modules. Empirically, AdaRank generalizes notably better on unseen data than using uniform ranks with the same number of parameters. Compared to prior work, AdaRank has the unique advantage of leaving the pretraining and adaptation stages completely intact: no need for any additional objectives or regularizers, which can hinder adaptation accuracy and performance.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: Hypernetworks in Transformers*\n\n*James Henderson, Mostafa Dehghani, Sebastian Ruder, Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: Hypernetworks in Transformers*\n\n*Jie Fu, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Boris Knyazev, Xinyu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Context Adaptation*\n\n*John Wieting, Iulia Turc, Dan Garrette, Jonathan H. Clark*\n\n**Abstract:** Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 2.8 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having 28% fewer model parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Context Adaptation*\n\n*Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Hari Subramoni, Aamir Shafi, Olatunji Ruwase, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs, Jinghan Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates efficient parameter adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Hypernetworks, here are some key points and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n## Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n\n- **LoRA** is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained model to downstream tasks by inserting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices. This method significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, making it efficient for both training and inference[5|.\n  - *Implementation Details:* LoRA involves freezing most of the pre-trained model\u2019s weights and adding low-rank matrices to adjust the weights. The forward computation of the adapted module is expressed using low-rank decomposition, which balances model adaptability and parameter efficiency.\n\n## Hypernetworks\n\n- **Hypernetworks** generate weights for a target network using a separate network, allowing dynamic generation of model parameters conditioned on input data. This can be particularly useful for context adaptation in language models.\n  - *Application in Transformers:* Hypernetworks can be used to generate method-specific and layer-specific parameters for LoRA modules, enhancing the model's adaptability to different contexts and tasks. This approach combines hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation, as seen in the HyperAT framework.\n\n## Integration with Transformer Architecture\n\n- **Adapting LoRA and Hypernetworks to Transformers:**\n  - The Movie Gen model, which generates high-quality videos, uses a Transformer backbone similar to LLaMa3. It incorporates text conditioning and adaptive layer norm blocks, which can be adapted for language models. This design allows for efficient scaling and training, similar to large language models (LLMs)[3|.\n  - **HyperAT Framework:** This framework combines hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation, generating weights for different LoRA modules based on method and layer embeddings. This approach is efficient in reducing computational costs and training time, making it suitable for large-scale language models.\n\n## Efficient Context Adaptation\n\n- **Prefix Tuning and Adapters:**\n  - These techniques involve adding small trainable modules or prefixes to the input or intermediate layers of the model, enabling efficient adaptation to new contexts without changing the entire network. These methods are complementary to LoRA and hypernetworks and can be integrated to enhance context adaptation[4|.\n  - *Example:* Prefix Tuning prepends a small sequence of trainable vectors to the input, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks or contexts efficiently.\n\n## Key References\n\n1. **Hu, E., Shen, Y., Wallis, P., Allen-Zhu, Z., Li, Y., Wang, L., & Chen, W.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022. Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. HyperMixer: An MLP-based Low Cost Alternative to Transformers  (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Florian Mai, Arnaud Pannatier, Fabio Fehr, Haolin Chen, Fran\u00e7ois Marelli, F. Fleuret, J. Henderson*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2022)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks, and demonstrates that this model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural language understanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadratic complexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can be difficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/40 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nEdward J Hu, yelong shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan AllenZhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, and Weizhu Chen. 2022.

However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. Generalizing Supervised Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction to Multiple and Unseen Contrasts using Meta-Learning Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Hypernetworks*\n\n*Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam, Keerthi Ram, Arun Palla, Sriprabha Ramanarayanan*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning has recently been an emerging data-efficient learning technique for various medical imaging operations and has helped advance contemporary deep learning models. Furthermore, meta-learning enhances the knowledge generalization of the imaging tasks by learning both shared and discriminative weights for various configurations of imaging tasks. However, existing meta-learning models attempt to learn a single set of weight initializations of a neural network that might be restrictive for multimodal data. This work aims to develop a multimodal meta-learning model for image reconstruction, which augments meta-learning with evolutionary capabilities to encompass diverse acquisition settings of multimodal data. Our proposed model called KM-MAML (Kernel Modulation-based Multimodal Meta-Learning), has hypernetworks that evolve to generate mode-specific weights. These weights provide the mode-specific inductive bias for multiple modes by re-calibrating each kernel of the base network for image reconstruction via a low-rank kernel modulation operation. We incorporate gradient-based meta-learning (GBML) in the contextual space to update the weights of the hypernetworks for different modes. The hypernetworks and the reconstruction network in the GBML setting provide discriminative mode-specific features and low-level image features, respectively. Experiments on multi-contrast MRI reconstruction show that our model, (i) exhibits superior reconstruction performance over joint training, other meta-learning methods, and context-specific MRI reconstruction methods, and (ii) better adaptation capabilities with improvement margins of 0.5 dB in PSNR and 0.01 in SSIM. Besides, a representation analysis with U-Net shows that kernel modulation infuses 80% of mode-specific representation changes in the high-resolution layers.

SiT: Exploring Flow and Diffusion-based Generative Models with Scalable Interpolant Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation in Transformers*\n\n*Saining Xie, Eric Vanden-Eijnden, Nicholas M. Boffi, Michael S. Albergo, Mark Goldstein, Nanye Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Scalable Interpolant Transformers (SiT), a family of generative models built on the backbone of Diffusion Transformers (DiT). The interpolant framework, which allows for connecting two distributions in a more flexible way than standard diffusion models, makes possible a modular study of various design choices impacting generative models built on dynamical transport: learning in discrete or continuous time, the objective function, the interpolant that connects the distributions, and deterministic or stochastic sampling. By carefully introducing the above ingredients, SiT surpasses DiT uniformly across model sizes on the conditional ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512 benchmark using the exact same model structure, number of parameters, and GFLOPs. By exploring various diffusion coefficients, which can be tuned separately from learning, SiT achieves an FID-50K score of 2.06 and 2.62, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16\n\n\n\n#### 4. AlphaClean: Automatic Generation of Data Cleaning Pipelines\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation in Transformers*\n\n*Eugene Wu, Sanjay Krishnan*\n\n**Abstract:** The analyst effort in data cleaning is gradually shifting away from the design of hand-written scripts to building and tuning complex pipelines of automated data cleaning libraries. Hyper-parameter tuning for data cleaning is very different than hyper-parameter tuning for machine learning since the pipeline components and objective functions have structure that tuning algorithms can exploit. This paper proposes a framework, called AlphaClean, that rethinks parameter tuning for data cleaning pipelines. AlphaClean provides users with a rich library to define data quality measures with weighted sums of SQL aggregate queries. AlphaClean applies generate-then-search framework where each pipelined cleaning operator contributes candidate transformations to a shared pool. Asynchronously, in separate threads, a search algorithm sequences them into cleaning pipelines that maximize the user-defined quality measures. This architecture allows AlphaClean to apply a number of optimizations including incremental evaluation of the quality measures and learning dynamic pruning rules to reduce the search space. Our experiments on real and synthetic benchmarks suggest that AlphaClean finds solutions of up-to 9x higher quality than naively applying state-of-the-art parameter tuning methods, is significantly more robust to straggling data cleaning methods and redundancy in the data cleaning library, and can incorporate state-of-the-art cleaning systems such as HoloClean as cleaning operators.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive LoRA in Language Models*\n\n*Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen, Shean Wang, Yuanzhi Li, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Phillip Wallis, Yelong Shen, Edward J. Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Conference:** lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. QA-LoRA: Quantization-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive LoRA in Language Models*\n\n*Zhengsu Chen, Qi Tian, Xiaopeng Zhang, Hengheng Zhang, Heng Chang, Xin Chen, Xiaotao Gu, Lingxi Xie, Yuhui Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios. Code will be made available at https://github.com/yuhuixu1993/qa-lora.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate low-rank adaptation with hypernetworks in transformer-based language models, here are some key insights and relevant information from the available sources:\n\n## Integration of Hypernetworks and LoRA\n\n### Conceptual Framework\nThe idea of combining hypernetworks with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) involves using a hypernetwork to dynamically generate the low-rank matrices used in LoRA. This approach is conceptually similar to the methods described in the context of other models:\n\n- **HyperAT Framework**: This framework, described in, uses a shared hypernetwork to generate method-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for adversarial training. Although focused on vision models, the principle of using hypernetworks to generate LoRA parameters can be adapted for language models.\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Generation\n- **Hypernetworks**: Hypernetworks can be used to generate weights for a target network, as explained in. This can be applied to generate the low-rank matrices in LoRA, allowing for context-dependent adaptation.\n- **LoRA**: LoRA itself is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique that adapts a pre-trained model by inserting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n- **Designing the Hypernetwork**: The hypernetwork should take as input a representation of the current context (e.g., encoded input embeddings or task embeddings) and output the low-rank adaptation matrices. This is similar to how HyperAT generates method-specific LoRA modules.\n- **Integration with MetaLearner GAU**: The hypernetwork should be integrated within the MetaLearner GAU, ensuring it interfaces effectively with existing components. This might involve adjustments to how parameters are updated and applied within the GAU.\n\n## Relevant Concepts and Techniques\n\n### Low-Rank Adaptation\n- **LoRA**: This technique adapts a pre-trained model by freezing most of the weights and inserting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices. It is efficient in terms of parameters and can be enhanced by dynamic generation using hypernetworks.\n\n### Hypernetworks\n- **Shared Hypernetworks**: Using shared hypernetworks across different layers and tasks can improve parameter efficiency and reduce computational costs. This is demonstrated in the HyperAT framework.\n\n### Adaptive MetaLearners\n- **Context-Conditioned Weight Generation**: Meta Adaptive Transformers adapt their weights based on input sequences, which is analogous to the goal of dynamically generating LoRA matrices. This approach can enhance the model's ability to handle diverse contexts and tasks.\n\n## Challenges and Considerations\n\n### Computational Overhead\n- While hypernetworks introduce additional computation, this can be minimized by designing a lightweight hypernetwork or by sharing it across layers, as suggested in.\n\n### Training Stability\n- Dynamic parameter generation can increase the complexity of the training process. Careful initialization, regularization, and optimization strategies will be necessary to ensure stable training.\n\n### Scalability\n- Ensuring the approach scales well with larger models is critical. Methods such as limiting the size of the hypernetwork or using shared hypernetworks for multiple layers can help.\n\n## Empirical Evidence and Future Search\n\nTo gather more concrete information, it is essential to search for empirical studies or experiments that have evaluated the combination of hypernetworks and LoRA in language models. Here are some suggestions for future searches:\n\n- **Conference Proceedings**: Look for recent conference papers or proceedings from top AI and NLP conferences (e.g., ACL, ICLR, NeurIPS) that might have practical implementations or empirical results.\n- **Open-Source Projects**: Explore open-source repositories or projects that implement similar techniques, such as the ones mentioned in the GitHub gist.\n- **Specific Architectural Designs**: Investigate specific architectural designs for hypernetworks used in transformers, such as those described in the Movie Gen paper, which although focused on video generation, provides insights into adapting transformer architectures.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather the necessary information to design and implement an effective integration of hypernetworks with LoRA in transformer-based language models.\n",

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts (Avg.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/40 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nEdward J Hu, yelong shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan AllenZhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, and Weizhu Chen. 2022.

Score: 0.51)\n\n*Ohad Rubin, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT) is proposed, an architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch and apply it to the task of modeling long texts.\n\n**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) have received much attention recently. However, typically the retriever is not trained jointly as a native component of the LM, but added post-hoc to an already-pretrained LM, which limits the ability of the LM and the retriever to adapt to one another. In this work, we propose the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), an architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch and apply it to the task of modeling long texts. Given a recently generated text chunk in a long document, the LM computes query representations, which are then used to retrieve earlier chunks in the document, located potentially tens of thousands of tokens before. Information from retrieved chunks is fused into the LM representations to predict the next target chunk. We train the retriever component with a semantic objective, where the goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of the next chunk, according to a reference LM. We evaluate RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks, spanning books, code, and mathematical writing, and demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality and subsequently perplexity across the board compared to strong baselines.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/34 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nYuhuai Wu, Markus Norman Rabe, DeLesley Hutchins, and Christian Szegedy. 2022.

Task-Agnostic Low-Rank Adapters for Unseen English Dialects\n\n*From Search Query: \"HyperLoRA\"*\n\n*Zedian Xiao, William Held, Yanchen Liu, Diyi Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on corpora disproportionally\nweighted in favor of Standard American English. As a result, speakers of other\ndialects experience significantly more failures when interacting with these\ntechnologies. In practice, these speakers often accommodate their speech to be\nbetter understood. Our work shares the belief that language technologies should\nbe designed to accommodate the diversity in English dialects and not the other\nway around. However, prior works on dialect struggle with generalizing to\nevolving and emerging dialects in a scalable manner. To fill this gap, our\nmethod, HyperLoRA, leverages expert linguistic knowledge to enable\nresource-efficient adaptation via hypernetworks. By disentangling\ndialect-specific and cross-dialectal information, HyperLoRA improves\ngeneralization to unseen dialects in a task-agnostic fashion. Not only is\nHyperLoRA more scalable in the number of parameters, but it also achieves the\nbest or most competitive performance across 5 dialects in a zero-shot setting.\nIn this way, our approach facilitates access to language technology for\nbillions of English dialect speakers who are traditionally underrepresented.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-02T01:17:29Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-02T01:17:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*From Search Query: \"HyperLoRA\"*\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. ALoRA: Allocating Low-Rank Adaptation for Fine-tuning Large Language\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic LoRA in Transformers\"*\n\n*Zequan Liu, Jiawen Lyn, Wei Zhu, Xing Tian, Yvette Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is widely studied for its\neffectiveness and efficiency in the era of large language models. Low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated commendable performance as a popular and\nrepresentative method. However, it is implemented with a fixed intrinsic rank\nthat might not be the ideal setting for the downstream tasks. Recognizing the\nneed for more flexible downstream task adaptation, we extend the methodology of\nLoRA to an innovative approach we call allocating low-rank adaptation (ALoRA)\nthat enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation\nprocess. First, we propose a novel method, AB-LoRA, that can effectively\nestimate the importance score of each LoRA rank. Second, guided by AB-LoRA, we\ngradually prune abundant and negatively impacting LoRA ranks and allocate the\npruned LoRA budgets to important Transformer modules needing higher ranks. We\nhave conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results\ndemonstrate that our ALoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with\ncomparable tunable parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-24T15:09:55Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-15T13:25:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic\n  Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic LoRA in Transformers\"*\n\n*Mojtaba Valipour, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Ivan Kobyzev, Ali Ghodsi*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has\nbecome more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters\n(LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce\nsome learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model.\nWhile LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems:\nfirst, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training\n(for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to\nre-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an\nexhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank\nadaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our\nDyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank\nby sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks\nduring training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language\nunderstanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and\nWebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with\ndifferent sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models\nwith DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA\nwithout significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can\nperform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14T06:29:22Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-19T04:28:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hypernetworks for Language Model Adaptation\"*\n\n*Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population\nmodels to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge\nof the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which\nrequires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this\nknowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit\nthe effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges,\nwe first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR\nadaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation\nperformance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting\n0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next\npropose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly\nindividualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of\natypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort\nand individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to\nout-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER\nreduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06T16:39:00Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-02T19:51:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

HyperLoRA for PDEs\n\n*From Search Query: \"HyperLoRA\"*\n\n*Venkataramana Runkana, Lovekesh Vig, Shirish Karande, Anirudh Deodhar, Vishal Jadhav, Ritam Majumdar*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely used to develop neural surrogates for solutions of Partial Differential Equations. A drawback of PINNs is that they have to be retrained with every change in initial-boundary conditions and PDE coefficients. The Hypernetwork, a model-based meta learning technique, takes in a parameterized task embedding as input and predicts the weights of PINN as output. Predicting weights of a neural network however, is a high-dimensional regression problem, and hypernetworks perform sub-optimally while predicting parameters for large base networks. To circumvent this issue, we use a low ranked adaptation (LoRA) formulation to decompose every layer of the base network into low-ranked tensors and use hypernetworks to predict the low-ranked tensors. Despite the reduced dimensionality of the resulting weight-regression problem, LoRA-based Hypernetworks violate the underlying physics of the given task. We demonstrate that the generalization capabilities of LoRA-based hypernetworks drastically improve when trained with an additional physics-informed loss component (HyperPINN) to satisfy the governing differential equations. We observe that LoRA-based HyperPINN training allows us to learn fast solutions for parameterized PDEs like Burger's equation and Navier Stokes: Kovasznay flow, while having an 8x reduction in prediction parameters on average without compromising on accuracy when compared to all other baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-18\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We have expanded the DiT framework originally designed for 2D image synthesis to accommodate the complexities of 3D video generation by incorporating a motion module block. It is used to capture temporal dynamics, thereby ensuring the production of consistent frames and seamless motion transitions. The motion module can be adapted to various DiT baseline methods to generate video with different styles. It can also generate videos with different frame rates and resolutions during both training and inference phases, suitable for both images and videos. Moreover, we introduce slice VAE, a novel approach to condense the temporal axis, facilitating the generation of long duration videos. Currently, EasyAnimate exhibits the proficiency to generate videos with 144 frames. We provide a holistic ecosystem for video production based on DiT, encompassing aspects such as data pre-processing, VAE training, DiT models training (both the baseline model and LoRA model), and end-to-end video inference.

LoRAShear: Efficient Large Language Model Structured Pruning and Knowledge Recovery\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic LoRA in Transformers\"*\n\n*Luming Liang, Ilya Zharkov, Badal Yadav, Tianyu Ding, Tianyi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the landscape of artificial intelligence, while their enormous size presents significant challenges in terms of computational costs. We introduce LoRAShear, a novel efficient approach to structurally prune LLMs and recover knowledge. Given general LLMs, LoRAShear at first creates the dependency graphs over LoRA modules to discover minimally removal structures and analyze the knowledge distribution. It then proceeds progressive structured pruning on LoRA adaptors and enables inherent knowledge transfer to better preserve the information in the redundant structures. To recover the lost knowledge during pruning, LoRAShear meticulously studies and proposes a dynamic fine-tuning schemes with dynamic data adaptors to effectively narrow down the performance gap to the full models. Numerical results demonstrate that by only using one GPU within a couple of GPU days, LoRAShear effectively reduced footprint of LLMs by 20% with only 1.0% performance degradation and significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hypernetworks for Language Model Adaptation\"*\n\n*James Henderson, Mostafa Dehghani, Sebastian Ruder, Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Our methods repurpose the popular generative image synthesis techniques of natural language guidance and diffusion models to generate neural network weights adapted for tasks. We first train an unconditional generative hypernetwork model to produce neural network weights; then we train a second \"guidance\" model that, given a natural language task description, traverses the hypernetwork latent space to find high-performance task-adapted weights in a zero-shot manner. We explore two alternative approaches for latent space guidance: \"HyperCLIP\"-based classifier guidance and a conditional Hypernetwork Latent Diffusion Model (\"HyperLDM\"), which we show to benefit from the classifier-free guidance technique common in image generation.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Integration of Hypernetworks with LoRA\n\n- **Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation:**\n  - By using a hypernetwork to generate the low-rank adaptation matrices in LoRA, we can enable the model to adjust these matrices dynamically based on the input context.\n  - This approach enhances the flexibility and adaptability of the MetaLearner without significantly increasing the number of parameters.\n\n- **Benefits:**\n  - **Parameter Efficiency:** Maintains a low parameter count similar to static LoRA while introducing dynamic adaptability.\n  - **Improved Generalization:** Allows the model to adapt to varying contexts and tasks, potentially improving performance on downstream tasks.\n  - **Memory Efficiency:** Dynamic generation of parameters can be more memory-efficient than storing separate adaptation matrices for different contexts.\n\n### Relevant Techniques and Approaches\n\n- **Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA):**\n  - Demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic composition in attention mechanisms.\n  - Suggests that dynamic parameter generation can increase the expressive power of the model.\n\n- **HyperMixer:**\n  - Uses hypernetworks to form token mixing MLPs dynamically.\n  - Indicates that hypernetworks can be effectively used to generate layer parameters conditioned on input data.\n\n- **LoGAH (Graph HyperNetworks):**\n  - Predicts the parameters of very large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner using hypernetworks.\n  - Shows that hypernetworks can scale to large models and generate parameters efficiently.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Designing the Hypernetwork:**\n  - The hypernetwork should be lightweight to avoid adding significant computational overhead.\n  - It should take as input a representation of the input context (e.g., token embeddings or layer activations).\n\n- **Integration with MetaLearner GAU:**\n  - The hypernetwork can be integrated within the existing MetaLearner, generating low-rank matrices for adaptation layers dynamically.\n  - May require modification of the forward pass to include context conditioning.\n\n- **Training Stability:**\n  - Dynamic parameter generation can introduce training challenges.\n  - Techniques such as careful initialization, regularization, and gradient clipping may be necessary.\n\n- **Computational Overhead and Efficiency:**\n  - Although hypernetworks add extra computation, the overhead can be minimized by:\n    - Sharing the hypernetwork across layers or modules.\n    - Using parameter-efficient hypernetwork architectures.\n\n### Potential Advantages Over Existing Methods\n\n- **Compared to Static LoRA:**\n  - Offers dynamic adaptability to different contexts without retraining or storing multiple adaptation matrices.\n\n- **Compared to Full Hypernetwork Approaches:**\n  - Generating only the low-rank adaptation matrices reduces computational cost compared to generating all parameters of the model.\n\n- **Compatibility with Quantization:**\n  - As shown in QA-LoRA, combining LoRA with quantization techniques can further reduce memory usage and computational cost.\n\n## 4. Future Search Plan / Next Steps\n\n- **Empirical Studies:**\n  - Search for empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of combining hypernetworks with LoRA in language models.\n  - Look for benchmarks or comparative studies that evaluate this approach on standard NLP tasks.\n\n- **Implementation Details:**\n  - Investigate specific architectures for hypernetworks used in transformer models.\n  - Examine how context information is encoded and fed into hypernetworks.\n\n- **Optimization Techniques:**\n  - Explore training strategies to ensure stability, such as learning rate schedules, regularization methods, and normalization techniques.\n\n- **Scalability Assessments:**\n  - Assess how this approach scales with larger models (e.g., models with billions of parameters).\n  - Consider potential bottlenecks and strategies to mitigate them.\n\n- **Prototype Development:**\n  - Start prototyping the integration within the MetaLearner GAU.\n  - Design experiments to measure performance improvements and computational overhead.\n\n## 5.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

The primary challenge lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length, leading to substantial computational time and memory requirements [4, 41, 21]. To address this challenge, several approaches have been proposed. Longformer and BigBird utilize combinations of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, reducing complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$ [4, 41]. Reformer introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thereby reducing computational complexity [21]. LSG Attention combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead [9]. Despite these advancements, managing long-context interactions in practical applications remains a significant challenge. Recent work, such as LongLoRA, extends the context window of LLaMA2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens using Position Interpolation without substantial GPU or TPU resources\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-02.jpg?height=535&width=1381&top_left_y=404&top_left_x=365)\n\nFigure 1: Evaluation of SinkLoRA in bridging the accuracy gap between sparse shifted attention and full attention during supervised fine-tuning, while maintaining the memory efficiency of LongLoRA, which utilizes 1.8 times less memory compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, SinkLoRA retains the training speed of LongLoRA, being 1.8 times faster than full fine-tuning, due to the implementation of Sink Fixed Attention. The Llama2-7B models[37] are fine-tuned to various context lengths using Flash-Attention 2 [10] and DeepSpeed stage 2 [31], and are evaluated on the proof-pile test set [2] in terms of perplexity. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-02.jpg?height=349&width=1214&top_left_y=1644&top_left_x=484)\n\nFigure 2: Overview of the SinkLoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating Sink Fixed Attention (SFAttn). Panels (a), (b), and (c) depict the procedure to convert Sparse Shifted Attention into Short Window Attention and subsequently into Sink Fixed Attention. This conversion is executed in two stages: reassembly and making the initial tokens global. In addition to optimizing the LoRA weights within linear layers, SinkLoRA also enables training of the embedding and normalization layers, consistent with the methodology employed in LongLoRA. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-03.jpg?height=633&width=1264&top_left_y=280&top_left_x=428)\n\nFigure 3: Overview of the SinkLoRA inference process. Unlike LongLoRA, which retains the original standard self-attention during inference, SinkLoRA implements an optional KV cache compression method, $\\mathrm{H}^{2} \\mathrm{O}$ [43]. This extension enhances inference speed without significantly compromising performance. [6]. However, LongLoRA's efficiency is limited, achieving only $39 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention due to chaotic attention head structures and unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, we propose SinkLoRA, which offers better work partitioning. This includes the development of Sink Fixed Attention (SF-Attn), a segmentation and reassembly algorithm that, along with the global attention of \"sink attention tokens,\" achieves $92 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement of full attention after fine-tuning. Additionally, we apply a state-of-the-art KV cache compression algorithm, Heavy Hitter Oracle $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$, to accelerate inference [43, 16, 25]. We further enhanced SinkLoRA through supervised fine-tuning using our self-collected LongAlpacaPlus dataset, comprising 28,000 entries from various sources, including Natural Questions, RedPajama [8], Book Summarization, and LongQA [6], ensuring a diverse and comprehensive collection for long instruction tuning. In summary, the contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n- We present SinkLoRA, a memory-efficient and effective method to extend the context length of LLaMA2 and LLaMA3, representing a complete update of LongLoRA. This method improves fine-tuning efficiency and offers a flexible deployment inference strategy. - We introduce SF-Attn, a fine-tuning method that combines a segmentation \\& reassembly algorithm and global attention. This method is easy to implement, accurate, and memoryefficient, without increasing computational complexity. By directly modifying the attention pattern, SF-Attn effectively redistributes attention scores, reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. - We achieve efficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments by using the Heavy Hitter Oracle $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right) \\mathrm{KV}$ caching method.\n```\n\n#### 4. DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively. As can be seen from the two cases examined above, the $\\Delta_{t}$ activation captures the needle location successfully, demonstrating the effectiveness of its 'importance scoring' mechanism. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=644&width=1604&top_left_y=1637&top_left_x=226)\n\nFigure 14: Measuring the Effects of Limited ERFs.

Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Key Components and Goals\n\n- **Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation**: Generate low-rank adaptation matrices dynamically using hypernetworks, conditioned on the input context.\n- **Enhanced Adaptability**: Improve the model's ability to adapt to varying inputs without significant increases in parameters.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Maintain parameter efficiency while enhancing performance and scalability.\n\n## Relevant Techniques and Approaches\n\n### HyperLoRA Integration\n\n- **HyperLoRA Framework**:\n  - This involves using a hypernetwork to generate LoRA's low-rank matrices dynamically based on input context or task-specific information. This approach enhances the model's adaptability without significantly increasing the number of parameters.\n\n### Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n- **DyLoRA**:\n  - This method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank, sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. This approach can train dynamic search-free models faster without compromising performance significantly.\n\n- **ALoRA**:\n  - Allocating Low-Rank Adaptation enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. This method can outperform recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\n\n### Hypernetwork Design and Implementation\n\n- **HyperMixer**:\n  - This shows that hypernetworks can generate layer parameters conditioned on input data, indicating potential architectures for the hypernetwork within the MetaLearner.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.03)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Neural Plasticity-Inspired Multimodal Foundation Model for Earth Observation\n\n*From Search Query: transformer hypernetwork integration*\n\n*Xiao Xiang Zhu, Gustau Camps-Valls, Bertrand Le Saux, Ioannis Papoutsis, Damian Borth, Jo\u00eblle Hanna, Adam J. Stewart, Fahong Zhang, Yi Wang, Zhitong Xiong*\n\n**Abstract:** The development of foundation models has revolutionized our ability to interpret the Earth's surface using satellite observational data. Traditional models have been siloed, tailored to specific sensors or data types like optical, radar, and hyperspectral, each with its own unique characteristics. This specialization hinders the potential for a holistic analysis that could benefit from the combined strengths of these diverse data sources. Our novel approach introduces the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, leveraging the concept of neural plasticity in brain science to integrate various data modalities into a single framework adaptively. This dynamic hypernetwork, adjusting to different wavelengths, enables a single versatile Transformer jointly trained on data from five sensors to excel across 12 distinct Earth observation tasks, including sensors never seen during pretraining. DOFA's innovative design offers a promising leap towards more accurate, efficient, and unified Earth observation analysis, showcasing remarkable adaptability and performance in harnessing the potential of multimodal Earth observation data.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-22\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hyper-CL: Conditioning Sentence Representations with Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: transformer hypernetwork integration*\n\n*Taeuk Kim, Changhyeon Kim, Jii Cha, Young Hyun Yoo*\n\n**Abstract:** While the introduction of contrastive learning frameworks in sentence representation learning has significantly contributed to advancements in the field, it still remains unclear whether state-of-the-art sentence embeddings can capture the fine-grained semantics of sentences, particularly when conditioned on specific perspectives. In this paper, we introduce Hyper-CL, an efficient methodology that integrates hypernetworks with contrastive learning to compute conditioned sentence representations. In our proposed approach, the hypernetwork is responsible for transforming pre-computed condition embeddings into corresponding projection layers. This enables the same sentence embeddings to be projected differently according to various conditions. Evaluation on two representative conditioning benchmarks, namely conditional semantic text similarity and knowledge graph completion, demonstrates that Hyper-CL is effective in flexibly conditioning sentence representations, showcasing its computational efficiency at the same time. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the inner workings of our approach, leading to a better interpretation of its mechanisms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient parameter adaptation*\n\n*Jimmy Ba, Diederik P. Kingma*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization\nof stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order\nmoments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally\nefficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling\nof the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of\ndata and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary\nobjectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The\nhyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little\ntuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are\ndiscussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the\nalgorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable\nto the best known results under the online convex optimization framework.\nEmpirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares\nfavorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax,\na variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.\n\n**Published:** 2014-12-22\n\n\n\n#### 4. EdgeFormer: A Parameter-Efficient Transformer for On-Device Seq2seq Generation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient parameter adaptation*\n\n*Furu Wei, Si-Qing Chen, Tao Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce EdgeFormer -- a parameter-efficient Transformer for on-device seq2seq generation under the strict computation and memory constraints. Compared with the previous parameter-efficient Transformers, EdgeFormer applies two novel principles for cost-effective parameterization, allowing it to perform better given the same parameter budget; moreover, EdgeFormer is further enhanced by layer adaptation innovation that is proposed for improving the network with shared layers. Extensive experiments show EdgeFormer can effectively outperform previous parameter-efficient Transformer baselines and achieve competitive results under both the computation and memory constraints. Given the promising results, we release EdgeLM -- the pretrained version of EdgeFormer, which is the first publicly available pretrained on-device seq2seq model that can be easily fine-tuned for seq2seq tasks with strong results, facilitating on-device seq2seq generation in practice.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. Attention as a Hypernetwork\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism hypernetwork*\n\n*Razvan Pascanu, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Yassir Akram, Seijin Kobayashi, Simon Schug*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is predictive of the subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions revealing that latent codes acquired during training are reused to solve unseen problem instances. To further examine the hypothesis that the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention supports compositional generalization, we ablate whether making the hypernetwork generated linear value network nonlinear strengthens compositionality. We find that this modification improves compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven Progressive Matrices human intelligence test which gives us precise control over the problem compositions encountered during training and evaluation. We demonstrate on this task how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization in transformers and gives rise to a functionally structured latent space.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 6. Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism hypernetwork*\n\n*Christopher Pal, Amine Elhattami, Jonathan Pilault*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/CAMTL/CA-MTL.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hypernetworks, attention mechanisms, and efficient parameter adaptation, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Integration Techniques for Hypernetworks in Transformer Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The integration of hypernetworks with transformer models can be seen in the context of generating parameters for different layers or tasks. For instance, the HyperAT framework combines hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to generate method-specific and layer-specific parameters, which can be applied to attention mechanisms in transformers. This approach allows for dynamic adaptation and efficient parameter generation without significantly increasing the number of trainable parameters.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Dynamic Parameter Adaptation\n\n- Low-rank adaptation methods, such as LoRA, are highly effective in reducing the number of parameters required for dynamic adaptation. By using hypernetworks to generate these low-rank parameters, models can adapt to new tasks or data without a substantial increase in memory usage. This is demonstrated in the HyperAT framework, where a shared hypernetwork generates parameters for different LoRA modules, ensuring parameter efficiency.\n\n## Empirical Studies Comparing Different Parameter Adaptation Methods in Transformers\n\n- The paper \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed\" provides insights into the importance of different attention layers in transformers. While it does not specifically focus on hypernetworks, it suggests that not all attention layers are equally critical, and some can be pruned or simplified. This finding can be combined with hypernetwork-based parameter adaptation to optimize the model further. For example, hypernetworks could be used to generate parameters for the most critical attention layers, enhancing efficiency and performance.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Hypernetwork-Based Models\n\n- The REACT method, which integrates a hypernetwork for adaptive weights, highlights the importance of efficient hardware utilization. By generating adaptive weights close to their optimal values, REACT enables fast adaptation to new distributions with minimal data. This approach can be optimized for hardware by ensuring efficient memory access patterns and leveraging block-based processing to manage memory usage effectively.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis in Dynamic Architecture Adaptation\n\n- Training stability is a critical aspect when integrating hypernetworks into transformer models. The Delta-STN and Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations papers provide valuable insights into addressing training stability issues. Reparameterization techniques and ensuring magnitude proportionality between inputs and outputs are crucial for stable optimization. Additionally, careful initialization and gradient flow management are necessary to avoid unstable training[Analysis Note: a, b].\n\n### Additional Insights and Techniques\n\n- **HyperMixer**: This model forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks, which performs better than alternative MLP-based models and on par with transformers. This demonstrates the potential of hypernetworks in improving the efficiency and performance of transformer-like models[Analysis Note: c].\n\n- **Weighted Grouped Query Attention**: This method introduces new learnable parameters that enable the model to take a weighted average during fine-tuning, which can be integrated with hypernetworks to enhance efficient parameter adaptation[Analysis Note: d].\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, adaptable, and robust. Here are some future directions:\n\n- **Specific Techniques for Combining Hypernetworks with Attention Mechanisms**: Investigate how hypernetworks can be used to generate parameters specifically for attention layers in transformers, focusing on the most critical layers identified by studies like \"What Matters in Transformers?\".\n\n- **Empirical Comparisons of Different Low-Rank Adaptation Methods**: Conduct experiments to compare the performance and efficiency of different low-rank adaptation methods, such as LoRA, when integrated with hypernetworks in transformer models.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization Strategies**: Explore optimized memory access patterns and block-based processing to ensure that hypernetwork-based models are efficiently executed on various hardware platforms.\n\n- **Memory Management Techniques**: Develop strategies to manage memory usage effectively in large language models using hypernetworks and low-rank adaptations, ensuring scalability and efficiency.\n\nBy addressing these areas, researchers can create more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.23)\n\n*Da Ju, Stephen Roller, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, J. Weston*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, and to provide improved modeling power compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks, in particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence as in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention procedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates across the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding another step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward tokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new part of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero that simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the weights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off performance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through time, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both. Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is shown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of parameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/21 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1804.09849, 2018.

Blockwise Parallel Transformer for Large Context Models (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*Hao Liu, P. Abbeel*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs and enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longerthan previous memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the cornerstone of state-of-the-art natural language processing models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide range of AI applications. However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Score: 0.13)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

This method efficiently\nbalances pre-trained knowledge retention and adaptability for task-specific\noptimizations. Through a randomized mechanism, LoRA-SP determines which\nparameters to update or freeze, significantly reducing computational and memory\nrequirements without compromising model performance. We evaluated LoRA-SP\nacross several benchmark NLP tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve\ncompetitive performance with substantially lower resource consumption compared\nto traditional full-parameter fine-tuning and other parameter-efficient\ntechniques.

HyperNetworks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork parameter generation*\n\n*David Ha, Andrew Dai, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Abstract:** This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also\nknown as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.\nHypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in\nnature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a\nphenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in\nevolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and\nthus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful\nfor deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where\nhypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.\nOur main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM\nand achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling\ntasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and\nneural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for\nrecurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to\nconvolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition\ntasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer\nlearnable parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork parameter generation*\n\n*Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian*\n\n**Abstract:** Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data disparities across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ from any client observed during training.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic low-rank adaptation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Low-Rank Instance Adaptation for Universal Neural Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic low-rank adaptation*\n\n*Wei Yang, Xiao Han, Wenming Yang, Jun Zhang, Jinxi Xiang, Yue Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** The latest advancements in neural image compression show great potential in surpassing the rate-distortion performance of conventional standard codecs. Nevertheless, there exists an indelible domain gap between the datasets utilized for training (i.e., natural images) and those utilized for inference (e.g., artistic images). Our proposal involves a low-rank adaptation approach aimed at addressing the rate-distortion drop observed in out-of-domain datasets. Specifically, we perform low-rank matrix decomposition to update certain adaptation parameters of the client's decoder. These updated parameters, along with image latents, are encoded into a bitstream and transmitted to the decoder in practical scenarios. Due to the low-rank constraint imposed on the adaptation parameters, the resulting bit rate overhead is small. Furthermore, the bit rate allocation of low-rank adaptation is \\emph{non-trivial}, considering the diverse inputs require varying adaptation bitstreams. We thus introduce a dynamic gating network on top of the low-rank adaptation method, in order to decide which decoder layer should employ adaptation. The dynamic adaptation network is optimized end-to-end using rate-distortion loss. Our proposed method exhibits universality across diverse image datasets. Extensive results demonstrate that this paradigm significantly mitigates the domain gap, surpassing non-adaptive methods with an average BD-rate improvement of approximately $19\\%$ across out-of-domain images. Furthermore, it outperforms the most advanced instance adaptive methods by roughly $5\\%$ BD-rate. Ablation studies confirm our method's ability to universally enhance various image compression architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient model adaptation*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

LLaMA-Adapter V2: Parameter-Efficient Visual Instruction Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient model adaptation*\n\n*Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Xiangyu Yue, Conghui He, Pan Lu, Wei zhang, Aojun Zhou, Shijie Geng, Ziyi Lin, Renrui Zhang, Jiaming Han, Peng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently transform large language models (LLMs) into instruction followers is recently a popular research direction, while training LLM for multi-modal reasoning remains less explored. Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter demonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot generalize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In this paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual instruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking more learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the instruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters. Secondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into the early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation. Thirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and instruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of learnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference between the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and achieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and instruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models (e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image understanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the original LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal instructions by merely introducing 14M parameters over LLaMA. The newly designed framework also exhibits stronger language-only instruction-following capabilities and even excels in chat interactions.

This approach involves a shared hypernetwork generating method-specific and layer-specific LoRA module parameters, which enhances parameter efficiency and adaptability across multiple tasks and layers.\n- This integration is novel and has the potential to significantly reduce computational costs and training time, making it a promising direction for improving autoregressive language models.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation Methods\n- The concept of using hypernetworks to generate weights for target networks is well-documented. For instance, \"Transformers as Statisticians: Provable In-Context Learning with In-Context Algorithm Selection\" discusses how hypernetworks can be used to generate weights for in-context learning, which can be adapted for dynamic parameter generation in language models.\n- \"HyperNetworks\" is a foundational work that explains how hypernetworks can dynamically generate parameters for neural networks, which can be applied to language models for efficient and context-dependent adaptation.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Adaptation Techniques\n- Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique that adapts a pretrained model by inserting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices, significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. This method is discussed in detail in the context of hypernetworks and LoRA integration.\n- Variants of LoRA, such as DyLoRA, AdaLoRA, QLoRA, and LoRA-FA, further enhance the efficiency and adaptability of this approach, making it suitable for memory-efficient model scaling.\n\n## Low-Rank Matrix Factorization in Neural Networks\n- The use of low-rank residuals and matrix factorization is a common theme in efficient adaptation methods. For example, \"RefineStyle: Dynamic Convolution Refinement for StyleGAN\" discusses how low-rank residuals can be used to refine dynamic convolution kernels, a concept that can be translated to language models for efficient parameter adaptation.\n- The integration of low-rank adaptation matrices generated by hypernetworks, as mentioned earlier, also leverages low-rank matrix factorization to achieve efficient model adaptation.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis for Dynamic Architectures\n- The stability of training dynamic architectures is crucial. Papers like \"On Mesa-Optimization in Autoregressively Trained Transformers: Emergence and Capability\" and \"Towards Better Understanding of In-Context Learning Ability from In-Context Uncertainty Quantification\" provide insights into the stability and robustness of in-context learning and dynamic parameter generation methods, which can be applied to the stability analysis of hypernetwork-based architectures.\n\n## Computational Overhead Analysis of Parameter Generation\n- The computational overhead of using hypernetworks to generate parameters is a key consideration. The \"Hyper Adversarial Tuning\" paper highlights that the use of hypernetworks can significantly reduce computational costs by avoiding the need for task-specific learnable parameters, making the approach efficient for large models.\n\n## Context-Dependent Weight Adaptation Methods\n- Context-dependent weight adaptation is a core aspect of the proposed HyperLoRA-Transformer. Papers such as \"Unveiling In-Context Learning: A Coordinate System to Understand Its Working Mechanism\" and \"Transformers are Minimax Optimal Nonparametric In-Context Learners\" provide deep insights into how transformers can learn and adapt in context, which can be enhanced by the dynamic parameter generation capabilities of hypernetworks.\n\nIn summary, the integration of hypernetworks with LoRA, the use of dynamic low-rank adaptation, and the focus on memory-efficient and context-dependent weight adaptation methods are all supported by current research trends and provide a solid foundation for improving autoregressive language model design.\n\n### Key References\n- **Hyper Adversarial Tuning for Boosting Adversarial Robustness**: This paper introduces the concept of using hypernetworks with LoRA, which is central to the proposed HyperLoRA-Transformer.\n- **Transformers as Statisticians: Provable In-Context Learning with In-Context Algorithm Selection**: This paper discusses the use of hypernetworks in in-context learning, which can be adapted for dynamic parameter generation.\n- **LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models**: This establishes the baseline LoRA method and its variants, which are crucial for efficient model adaptation.\n- **RefineStyle: Dynamic Convolution Refinement for StyleGAN**: This paper provides insights into the use of low-rank residuals for dynamic kernel refinement, a concept that can be applied to language models.\n\nThese references and concepts should help the researchers in achieving their goal of designing a more efficient, scalable, and adaptable autoregressive language model.\n",

Henderson*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2022)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks, and demonstrates that this model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural language understanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadratic complexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can be difficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Weston*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, and to provide improved modeling power compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks, in particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence as in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention procedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates across the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding another step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward tokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new part of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero that simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the weights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off performance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through time, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both. Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is shown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of parameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/21 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1804.09849, 2018.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

HyperMixer: An MLP-based Low Cost Alternative to Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: transformer hypernetwork architecture*\n\n*James Henderson, Francois Fleuret, Francois Marelli, Haolin Chen, Fabio Fehr, Arnaud Pannatier, Florian Mai*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural language understanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadratic complexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can be difficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks.

Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: transformer hypernetwork architecture*\n\n*Christopher Pal, Amine Elhattami, Jonathan Pilault*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient parameter generation*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 4. EdgeFormer: A Parameter-Efficient Transformer for On-Device Seq2seq Generation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient parameter generation*\n\n*Furu Wei, Si-Qing Chen, Tao Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce EdgeFormer -- a parameter-efficient Transformer for on-device seq2seq generation under the strict computation and memory constraints. Compared with the previous parameter-efficient Transformers, EdgeFormer applies two novel principles for cost-effective parameterization, allowing it to perform better given the same parameter budget; moreover, EdgeFormer is further enhanced by layer adaptation innovation that is proposed for improving the network with shared layers. Extensive experiments show EdgeFormer can effectively outperform previous parameter-efficient Transformer baselines and achieve competitive results under both the computation and memory constraints. Given the promising results, we release EdgeLM -- the pretrained version of EdgeFormer, which is the first publicly available pretrained on-device seq2seq model that can be easily fine-tuned for seq2seq tasks with strong results, facilitating on-device seq2seq generation in practice.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. Delta-STN: Efficient Bilevel Optimization for Neural Networks using Structured Response Jacobians\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hypernetworks*\n\n*Roger Grosse, Juhan Bae*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperparameter optimization of neural networks can be elegantly formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. While research on bilevel optimization of neural networks has been dominated by implicit differentiation and unrolling, hypernetworks such as Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) have recently gained traction due to their ability to amortize the optimization of the inner objective. In this paper, we diagnose several subtle pathologies in the training of STNs. Based on these observations, we propose the $\\Delta$-STN, an improved hypernetwork architecture which stabilizes training and optimizes hyperparameters much more efficiently than STNs. The key idea is to focus on accurately approximating the best-response Jacobian rather than the full best-response function; we achieve this by reparameterizing the hypernetwork and linearizing the network around the current parameters. We demonstrate empirically that our $\\Delta$-STN can tune regularization hyperparameters (e.g. weight decay, dropout, number of cutout holes) with higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved stability compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 6. Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations Improve Hypernetwork Learning\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hypernetworks*\n\n*Adrian Dalca, John Guttag, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz*\n\n**Abstract:** Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hypernetworks and transformer architectures, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and details:\n\n## Specific Architectures Combining Hypernetworks with Transformer Attention\n\n- The concept of using hypernetworks within transformer architectures is explored in the context of compositional generalization and dynamic parameter generation. For instance, reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork reveals that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. This approach supports compositional generalization and can be seen in studies that analyze the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention.\n\n- The use of hypernetworks to generate parameters dynamically is demonstrated in models like HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. This approach shows promise in performing on par with traditional Transformers while offering dynamic parameter generation.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques for Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- Memory efficiency can be achieved through techniques like low-rank adaptation, as seen in DyLoRA. This method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks, allowing for dynamic adaptation without significantly increasing the number of parameters. This approach helps in managing memory by introducing only a small number of learnable parameters.\n\n- The LLaMA-Adapter method also highlights the importance of lightweight adaptation, introducing only 1.2M learnable parameters upon a frozen large model. This shows that careful design can lead to memory-efficient dynamic parameter generation.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis for Hypernetwork-Based Transformers\n\n- Training stability is a critical aspect when using hypernetworks. Studies suggest that the design of the hypernetwork itself is crucial for maintaining stability. For example, using a small pretrained neural network (hypernetwork) to steer results towards a particular direction can help in stabilizing the training process, as seen in the Stable Diffusion models.\n\n- Theoretical analysis and empirical validation, such as the work on generalized probabilistic attention mechanisms (GPAM), indicate that careful design of attention mechanisms can mitigate issues like gradient vanishing and rank-collapse, which are important for training stability.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Dynamic Parameter Updates\n\n- Efficient implementations can be achieved by focusing on the most critical attention layers and pruning or simplifying less important ones. This approach, discussed in \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed,\" can help in reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.\n\n- The use of sparse Gaussian processes (SGP) in the context of transformer models, as proposed in \"Calibrating Transformers via Sparse Gaussian Processes,\" can also improve efficiency by approximating the posterior processes of multi-head attention blocks, thus reducing the computational load.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Hypernetworks in Language Models\n\n- Integration strategies involve combining hypernetworks with attention mechanisms effectively. For instance, reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork can enhance compositional generalization. This approach allows the model to reuse latent codes acquired during training to solve unseen problem instances.\n\n- The multimodal diffusion transformer (MMDiT) architecture in Stable Diffusion 3.0, which mixes text and image encodings inside its operations using hypernetworks, provides a practical example of integrating hypernetworks into transformer architectures for multimodal tasks.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design:\n\n- **Use hypernetworks** to dynamically generate parameters, as in HyperMixer and DyLoRA, to enhance flexibility and efficiency.\n- **Implement low-rank adaptations** to manage memory efficiently, such as in DyLoRA.\n- **Ensure training stability** through careful hypernetwork design and attention mechanism optimization, as in GPAM.\n- **Optimize attention layers** by identifying and focusing on the most critical layers, as suggested in \"What Matters in Transformers?\"\n- **Integrate hypernetworks** effectively into transformer architectures, such as in MMDiT, to enhance compositional generalization and multimodal capabilities.\n",

However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Delta-STN: Efficient Bilevel Optimization for Neural Networks using Structured Response Jacobians\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork training stability*\n\n*Roger Grosse, Juhan Bae*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperparameter optimization of neural networks can be elegantly formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. While research on bilevel optimization of neural networks has been dominated by implicit differentiation and unrolling, hypernetworks such as Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) have recently gained traction due to their ability to amortize the optimization of the inner objective. In this paper, we diagnose several subtle pathologies in the training of STNs. Based on these observations, we propose the $\\Delta$-STN, an improved hypernetwork architecture which stabilizes training and optimizes hyperparameters much more efficiently than STNs. The key idea is to focus on accurately approximating the best-response Jacobian rather than the full best-response function; we achieve this by reparameterizing the hypernetwork and linearizing the network around the current parameters. We demonstrate empirically that our $\\Delta$-STN can tune regularization hyperparameters (e.g. weight decay, dropout, number of cutout holes) with higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved stability compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations Improve Hypernetwork Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork training stability*\n\n*Adrian Dalca, John Guttag, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz*\n\n**Abstract:** Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Optimal Hard Threshold for Singular Values is 4/sqrt(3)\n\n*From Search Query: low rank adaptation comparison*\n\n*David L. Donoho, Matan Gavish*\n\n**Abstract:** We consider recovery of low-rank matrices from noisy data by hard thresholding of singular values, where singular values below a prescribed threshold $\\lambda$ are set to 0. We study the asymptotic MSE in a framework where the matrix size is large compared to the rank of the matrix to be recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant. The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of n-by-n matrix in noise level \\sigma, is simply $(4/\\sqrt{3}) \\sqrt{n}\\sigma \\approx 2.309 \\sqrt{n}\\sigma$ when $\\sigma$ is known, or simply $2.858\\cdot y_{med}$ when $\\sigma$ is unknown, where $y_{med}$ is the median empirical singular value. For nonsquare $m$ by $n$ matrices with $m \\neq n$, these thresholding coefficients are replaced with different provided constants. In our asymptotic framework, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and to unknown noise level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any other value, no matter what the matrix is that we are trying to recover, and is always better than ideal Truncated SVD (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the recommended value to recover an n-by-n matrix of rank r guarantees an AMSE at most $3nr\\sigma^2$. In comparison, the guarantee provided by TSVD is $5nr\\sigma^2$, the guarantee provided by optimally tuned singular value soft thresholding is $6nr\\sigma^2$, and the best guarantee achievable by any shrinkage of the data singular values is $2nr\\sigma^2$. Empirical evidence shows that these AMSE properties of the $4/\\sqrt{3}$ thresholding rule remain valid even for relatively small n, and that performance improvement over TSVD and other shrinkage rules is substantial, turning it into the practical hard threshold of choice.\n\n**Published:** 2013-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 4. Low-Rank Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: low rank adaptation comparison*\n\n*Ismail Ben Ayed, Maxime Zanella*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in the few-shot adaptation of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has further pushed their generalization capabilities, at the expense of just a few labeled samples within the target downstream task. However, this promising, already quite abundant few-shot literature has focused principally on prompt learning and, to a lesser extent, on adapters, overlooking the recent advances in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). Furthermore, existing few-shot learning methods for VLMs often rely on heavy training procedures and/or carefully chosen, task-specific hyper-parameters, which might impede their applicability. In response, we introduce Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in few-shot learning for VLMs, and show its potential on 11 datasets, in comparison to current state-of-the-art prompt- and adapter-based approaches. Surprisingly, our simple CLIP-LoRA method exhibits substantial improvements, while reducing the training times and keeping the same hyper-parameters in all the target tasks, i.e., across all the datasets and numbers of shots. Certainly, our surprising results do not dismiss the potential of prompt-learning and adapter-based research. However, we believe that our strong baseline could be used to evaluate progress in these emergent subjects in few-shot VLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Learning State-Dependent Losses for Inverse Dynamics Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic parameters*\n\n*Austin S. Wang, Yixin Lin, Neha Das, Kristen Morse, Franziska Meier, Akshara Rai*\n\n**Abstract:** Being able to quickly adapt to changes in dynamics is paramount in model-based control for object manipulation tasks. In order to influence fast adaptation of the inverse dynamics model's parameters, data efficiency is crucial. Given observed data, a key element to how an optimizer updates model parameters is the loss function. In this work, we propose to apply meta-learning to learn structured, state-dependent loss functions during a meta-training phase. We then replace standard losses with our learned losses during online adaptation tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on inverse dynamics learning tasks, both in simulation and on real hardware data. In both settings, the structured and state-dependent learned losses improve online adaptation speed, when compared to standard, state-independent loss functions.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-10\n\n\n\n#### 6. NeuralSim: Augmenting Differentiable Simulators with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic parameters*\n\n*Gaurav S. Sukhatme, Yizhou Sheng, Erwin Coumans, David Millard, Eric Heiden*\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable simulators provide an avenue for closing the sim-to-real gap by enabling the use of efficient, gradient-based optimization algorithms to find the simulation parameters that best fit the observed sensor readings. Nonetheless, these analytical models can only predict the dynamical behavior of systems for which they have been designed. In this work, we study the augmentation of a novel differentiable rigid-body physics engine via neural networks that is able to learn nonlinear relationships between dynamic quantities and can thus learn effects not accounted for in traditional simulators.Such augmentations require less data to train and generalize better compared to entirely data-driven models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our hybrid simulator to learn complex dynamics involving frictional contacts from real data, as well as match known models of viscous friction, and present an approach for automatically discovering useful augmentations. We show that, besides benefiting dynamics modeling, inserting neural networks can accelerate model-based control architectures. We observe a ten-fold speed-up when replacing the QP solver inside a model-predictive gait controller for quadruped robots with a neural network, allowing us to significantly improve control delays as we demonstrate in real-hardware experiments. We publish code, additional results and videos from our experiments on our project webpage at https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/neuralsim.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hypernetworks, low-rank adaptations, and dynamic parameter generation, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Training Stability Techniques for Hypernetworks\n\n- The paper on \"HyperDet\" discusses the use of hypernetworks for generating parameters, which can help in stabilizing the training process. It mentions the use of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and hypernetworks to fine-tune models, which can reduce the number of parameters to be tuned and enhance computational efficiency and inference speed.\n- The concept of \"Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations\" highlights the importance of addressing magnitude proportionality issues between inputs and outputs in hypernetworks to ensure stable training. Reparameterization and normalization strategies are crucial for this[Analysis].\n- \"Delta-STN\" provides insights into diagnosing and solving subtle pathologies in the training of hypernetworks, suggesting improved hypernetwork architectures that stabilize training through reparameterization[Analysis].\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Low-Rank Adaptation Methods\n\n- The \"HyperDet\" paper compares and integrates LoRA with hypernetworks, showing that LoRA can efficiently fine-tune large models by constraining parameter updates within two low-rank matrices. This method reduces the number of parameters to be tuned, preserving pre-trained knowledge while improving computational efficiency.\n- \"Hyper Adversarial Tuning\" (HyperAT) also utilizes LoRA in conjunction with hypernetworks for adversarial robustness. It demonstrates that generating method-specific and layer-specific LoRA module parameters using a hypernetwork can be more efficient and effective than traditional fine-tuning methods.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- The use of hypernetworks to generate dynamic parameters, as seen in \"HyperDet\" and \"Hyper Adversarial Tuning,\" is hardware-efficient. These methods generate parameters using a lightweight hypernetwork, reducing the computational costs and training time compared to full parameter fine-tuning.\n- The concept of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is particularly beneficial for hardware efficiency, as it significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated during fine-tuning, thus managing resources more effectively.\n\n## Success Stories of Hypernetworks in Transformer Architectures\n\n- \"HyperDet\" showcases the successful application of hypernetworks and LoRA in fine-tuning the CLIP model for synthetic image detection. This approach enhances model flexibility and generalization while reducing training resource consumption.\n- The integration of hypernetworks with transformer architectures, as discussed in the analysis, highlights their potential in improving performance. For example, \"HyperMixer\" demonstrates that using hypernetworks to form token mixing MLPs can perform on par with transformers while offering efficiency gains[Analysis].\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies for Dynamic Parameter Updates\n\n- Low-rank adaptation methods like LoRA are key to memory optimization. By constraining parameter updates within low-rank matrices, these methods reduce the memory footprint required for fine-tuning large models.\n- Block-based processing, as implied in the use of hypernetworks and LoRA, helps manage resources by updating only a subset of parameters, thus optimizing memory usage during training and inference.\n\nIn summary, the integration of hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation methods (like LoRA) offers a promising approach for improving the stability, efficiency, and performance of autoregressive language models. These techniques can enhance training stability, reduce computational costs, and optimize memory usage, making them highly suitable for large language models.\n",

However, challenges persist in efficiently adapting these models to diverse contexts and tasks without incurring substantial computational and memory overhead. Traditional fine-tuning approaches require updating a significant portion of the model's parameters, which is impractical for large models due to storage and computational constraints.\n\nThe MetaLearner GAU in our seed design aims to dynamically adjust attention weights based on input context. However, it introduces additional computational overhead and may not scale efficiently with larger models or longer sequences. There is a pressing need for a more efficient adaptation mechanism that allows the model to adjust to different contexts dynamically without significantly increasing the number of trainable parameters or computational costs.\n\nIntegrating low-rank adaptation techniques with hypernetworks presents a promising solution. By dynamically generating low-rank adaptation matrices conditioned on the input context, we can enhance the MetaLearner's adaptability and efficiency. This approach leverages the parameter efficiency of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and the dynamic parameter generation capabilities of hypernetworks, offering improved performance and scalability in transformer-based language models.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n\nLoRA [1] introduces trainable low-rank matrices into each layer of a pre-trained transformer, allowing efficient fine-tuning by significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. It modifies the weight matrices by adding a low-rank update:\n\n\\[\n\\mathbf{W}' = \\mathbf{W} + \\Delta \\mathbf{W}, \\quad \\text{where} \\ \\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times d}\\) are the low-rank matrices with rank \\(r \\ll d\\).\n\n### Hypernetworks\n\nHypernetworks [2] are networks that generate the weights of another network. In the context of transformers, hypernetworks can be used to generate parameters dynamically based on input context or task-specific information, allowing for efficient adaptation without significant increases in computational overhead.\n\n### Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Hypernetworks\n\nRecent works such as DyLoRA [3] and ALoRA [4] explore dynamic low-rank adaptation techniques. DyLoRA trains low-rank adaptation blocks for a range of ranks without the need for rank selection heuristics, while ALoRA enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during adaptation. HyperLoRA [5] integrates hypernetworks with LoRA to generate low-rank adaptation matrices dynamically.\n\nThese methods demonstrate the potential of combining low-rank adaptation with dynamic parameter generation to enhance model adaptability and efficiency.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Limitations of the Existing MetaLearner GAU\n\nThe current MetaLearner GAU employs a meta-learning module that dynamically adjusts attention weights based on input context. While this improves adaptability, it introduces computational overhead due to additional neural network layers and may not scale efficiently with larger models or longer sequences.\n\n### Proposed Solution: Integrate HyperLoRA into MetaLearner\n\nBy integrating hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation (HyperLoRA) into the MetaLearner GAU, we aim to:\n\n- **Reduce Computational Overhead**: Generate only the low-rank adaptation matrices dynamically, resulting in fewer parameters and reduced computational costs.\n- **Enhance Adaptability**: Allow the model to adjust to different contexts dynamically based on input, improving performance on varied tasks.\n- **Improve Scalability**: Maintain efficiency when scaling to larger models and longer sequences.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n#### Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation\n\nIn traditional LoRA, the low-rank matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are static after training. By using a hypernetwork to generate these matrices dynamically based on the input context \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n\\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{X})\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{X})\n\\]\n\nThe hypernetwork \\(h\\) generates \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\):\n\n\\[\n(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}) = h(\\mathbf{X})\n\\]\n\nThis allows \\(\\Delta \\mathbf{W}\\) to adapt dynamically to the input, providing more flexible and context-specific adjustments.\n\n#### Efficiency Gains\n\nSince the hypernetwork only generates low-rank matrices, the number of additional parameters introduced is minimal compared to generating full weight matrices. This maintains computational efficiency while enhancing adaptability.\n\n#### Expected Performance Improvement\n\nBy providing context-specific adaptations, the model can better capture dependencies and nuances in the data, potentially leading to improved perplexity and accuracy on downstream tasks.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\n- **Computational Overhead of Hypernetworks**: Introducing a hypernetwork adds computation. However, since it generates low-rank matrices, the overhead is mitigated.\n- **Training Complexity**: Training with dynamic parameter generation can be more complex. Careful design and optimization strategies are required to ensure stability.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection MetaLearner```\n\n### Modifications Overview\n\nWe propose modifying the **MetaLearner** GAU by integrating a hypernetwork that generates low-rank adaptation matrices dynamically based on the input context. This new component, named **HyperLoRA MetaLearner**, will replace or augment the existing meta-learning strategies within the MetaLearner GAU.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Hypernetwork Design\n\n- **Input**: The hypernetwork \\(h\\) takes as input a summary of the input context \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). This can be achieved by applying a pooling operation or using a context vector derived from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\).\n- **Architecture**: A lightweight neural network with one or two layers to minimize computational overhead.\n- **Output**: Generates the low-rank matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) for the low-rank adaptation.\n\n#### 2. Integration into MetaLearner\n\n- **Modified Weight Update**: Instead of static weights, the MetaLearner's weight matrices are updated as:\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{W}' = \\mathbf{W} + \\Delta \\mathbf{W}, \\quad \\text{where} \\ \\Delta \\mathbf{W} = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{X})\\mathbf{B}(\\mathbf{X})\n  \\]\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Generation**: For each input batch, the hypernetwork generates adaptation matrices conditioned on the specific context, enabling dynamic adjustments.\n\n#### 3. Training Strategy\n\n- **Joint Training**: The main model and the hypernetwork are trained jointly, allowing the model to learn both the base representations and the context-dependent adaptations.\n\n- **Regularization**: Apply techniques such as weight decay and dropout to prevent overfitting and ensure training stability.\n\n#### 4. Theoretical Analysis\n\n- **Computational Complexity**: The additional computation introduced by the hypernetwork is \\(O(r \\cdot d)\\), where \\(r\\) is the rank and \\(d\\) is the embedding dimension, which is negligible compared to the overall model size.\n\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: The number of parameters added by the hypernetwork is minimal, maintaining the model's parameter efficiency.\n\n- **Adaptability**: By dynamically adjusting the weights, the model can adapt to different contexts more effectively, potentially improving performance on tasks requiring context understanding.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for HyperLoRA MetaLearner\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass HyperLoRAMetaLearner(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    HyperLoRA MetaLearner integrates dynamic low-rank adaptation via a hypernetwork\n    into the MetaLearner GAU for efficient context-adaptive parameter adjustments.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, rank: int = 4, hypernet_hidden_dim: int = 128, \n                 **kwargs):\n        \"\"\"\n        Args:\n            embed_dim (int): Dimension of input embeddings.\n            block_loc (tuple): Location of the block in the network.\n            kwarg_all (dict): Additional keyword arguments.\n            rank (int): Rank for the low-rank adaptation matrices.\n            hypernet_hidden_dim (int): Hidden dimension for the hypernetwork.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.rank = rank\n\n        # Base weight matrix (frozen during adaptation)\n        self.W_base = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(embed_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        nn.init.xavier_uniform_(self.W_base)\n\n        # Hypernetwork to generate low-rank matrices A and B\n        self.hypernet = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, hypernet_hidden_dim, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(hypernet_hidden_dim, 2 * embed_dim * rank, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n\n        self.activation = nn.SiLU()\n        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=0.1)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forward pass for HyperLoRA MetaLearner.\n        Args:\n            X (Tensor): Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim).\n            Z (dict): Intermediate variables.\n        Returns:\n            Y (Tensor): Output tensor with dynamic low-rank adaptation applied.\n            Z (dict): Updated intermediate variables.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Context encoding (e.g., mean pooling over sequence length)\n        context_vector = torch.mean(X, dim=1)  # Shape: (batch_size, embed_dim)\n\n        # Generate low-rank adaptation matrices A and B\n        hypernet_output = self.hypernet(context_vector)  # Shape: (batch_size, 2 * embed_dim * rank)\n        A, B = torch.chunk(hypernet_output, 2, dim=-1)\n        A = A.view(-1, self.embed_dim, self.rank)\n        B = B.view(-1, self.rank, self.embed_dim)\n\n        # Compute Delta W\n        delta_W = torch.bmm(A, B)  # Shape: (batch_size, embed_dim, embed_dim)\n\n        # Apply weight updates to the base weight\n        W_adapted = self.W_base + delta_W  # Shape: (batch_size, embed_dim, embed_dim)\n\n        # Normalize input\n        X_norm = self.norm(X)\n\n        # Linear transformation with adapted weights\n        Y = torch.bmm(X_norm, W_adapted)  # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n\n        # Activation and dropout\n        Y = self.activation(Y)\n        Y = self.dropout(Y)\n\n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Initialize HyperLoRA MetaLearner**\n\n   -
