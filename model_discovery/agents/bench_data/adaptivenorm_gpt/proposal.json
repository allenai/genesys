Despite recent strides in making LLMs process contexts with more than 100K tokens, there is currently a lack of a standardized benchmark to evaluate this long-context capability. Existing public benchmarks typically focus on contexts around 10K tokens, limiting the assessment and comparison of LLMs in processing longer contexts. In this paper, we propose $\\infty$Bench, the first LLM benchmark featuring an average data length surpassing 100K tokens. $\\infty$Bench comprises synthetic and realistic tasks spanning diverse domains, presented in both English and Chinese. The tasks in $\\infty$Bench are designed to require well understanding of long dependencies in contexts, and make simply retrieving a limited number of passages from contexts not sufficient for these tasks. In our experiments, based on $\\infty$Bench, we evaluate the state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs tailored for processing long contexts. The results indicate that existing long context LLMs still require significant advancements to effectively process 100K+ context. We further present three intriguing analyses regarding the behavior of LLMs processing long context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/33 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLuyang Robby Huang, Shuyang Cao, Nikolaus Nova Parulian, Heng Ji, and Lu Wang. 2021.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nOfir Press and Lior Wolf. 2016.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Universal Transformers  (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Mostafa Dehghani, Stephan Gouws, O. Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, Lukasz Kaiser*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2018)\t**Cited by** 673  (*Influential: 65*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses issues of parallelizability and global receptive field, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02357, 2016.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory efficient*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Karan Sapra, Andrew Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test).\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention mechanisms, memory-efficient architectures, and techniques for handling long-range dependencies, here are some key findings and approaches from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n### DuoAttention\nThe \"DuoAttention\" mechanism is particularly noteworthy for its efficiency in managing memory in long-context language models. It categorizes attention heads into \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads,\" allowing the model to retain critical long-term context while minimizing memory usage for less important details. This approach ensures that the model can handle long contexts efficiently without compromising on performance.\n\n### Hierarchical Self-Attention in Nova\nThe Nova model introduces a hierarchical self-attention mechanism designed to capture low-density semantics in assembly code at three granularity levels: intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention. This hierarchical approach can be adapted for other types of sequential data, enhancing the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies effectively.\n\n### Hierarchical Multimodal LLMs\nThe HiTime model uses a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data, which can be aligned with textual representations through a dual-view contrastive alignment module. This hierarchical encoding strategy ensures that the model retains essential temporal patterns and adapts to specific classification tasks, showcasing its potential for handling complex sequential data.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Architectures\n\n### Memory-Augmented Architectures\nMemory-augmented architectures, such as those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and attention mechanisms, can significantly enhance the ability of models to retain and utilize information over extended interactions. These architectures can be optimized further by using modular designs that divide tasks into specialized modules, reducing cognitive load and improving scalability.\n\n### DuoAttention's Cache Management\nDuoAttention's strategy of using a full Key-Value (KV) cache for retrieval heads and a reduced, constant-length cache for streaming heads is highly memory-efficient. This differentiated caching approach ensures that the model retains critical context information while minimizing unnecessary memory allocation.\n\n## Handling Long-Range Dependencies\n\n### Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM)\nHCAM's two-level attention mechanism, which performs high-level attention over coarse summaries of chunks and then detailed attention within the most relevant chunks, is an effective way to handle long-range dependencies efficiently. This approach can be integrated into hierarchical attention mechanisms to optimize memory access patterns[Analysis Note].\n\n### 3D-RPE and Position Encoding\nThe 3D-RPE (3D Rotary Position Encoding) technique enhances long-context modeling by regulating long-term decay within chunk sizes, ensuring better modeling of relative positional information between tokens at distant positions. This can be combined with hierarchical attention to improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficiency Considerations\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention can significantly improve computational efficiency. This hardware-efficient approach performs matrix operations in an analog manner, reducing the computational load associated with attention mechanisms.\n\n### Training-Free Optimization Techniques\nTechniques like TRAMS (Training-free Memory Selection) allow for the selection of tokens participating in attention calculations without additional training, which can be integrated into hierarchical attention models to optimize memory usage and reduce computational overhead[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more memory-efficient, capable of handling long-range dependencies effectively, and optimized for both computational efficiency and performance.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: Implement mechanisms like DuoAttention and Nova's hierarchical self-attention to categorize and manage attention heads efficiently.\n- **Memory Management**: Use memory-augmented architectures and techniques like HCAM and TRAMS to optimize memory usage and access patterns.\n- **Position Encoding**: Integrate 3D-RPE or similar position encoding techniques to enhance long-range dependency modeling.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Explore hardware-efficient implementations such as memristor-based in-memory computing to reduce computational load.\n- **Training-Free Optimization**: Incorporate training-free optimization techniques to further optimize memory selection and attention mechanisms.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F. Chen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, Patrick Gallinari*\n\n**Published in:** Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs that effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models are a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 4. Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multi-modal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Wenbing Li, Hang Zhou, Junqing Yu, Zikai Song, Wei Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Coupled SSM model is proposed, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes, and demonstrates that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities. However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\\%, 0.9\\%, and 2.3\\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\\% faster inference and 83.7\\% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/22 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the conference.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Attentive State-Space Modeling of Disease Progression\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Mihaela van der Schaar, Ahmed M. Alaa*\n\n**Abstract:** Models of disease progression are instrumental for predicting patient outcomes and understanding disease dynamics. Existing models provide the patient with pragmatic (supervised) predictions of risk, but do not provide the clinician with intelligible (unsupervised) representations of disease pathophysiology. In this paper, we develop the attentive state-space model, a deep probabilistic model that learns accurate and interpretable structured representations for disease trajectories. Unlike Markovian state-space models, in which the dynamics are memoryless, our model uses an attention mechanism to create \"memoryful\" dynamics, whereby attention weights determine the dependence of future disease states on past medical history. To learn the model parameters from medical records, we develop an infer ence algorithm that simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the model parameters, leveraging the attentive state-space representation to construct a  \"Rao-Blackwellized\" variational approximation of the posterior state distribution. Experiments on data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis registry show that our model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and provides insights into the progression of chronic disease.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cross-attention Inspired Selective State Space Models for Target Sound Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Tianshu Qu, Xihong Wu, Yiwen Wang, Donghang Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer model, particularly its cross-attention module, is widely used for feature fusion in target sound extraction which extracts the signal of interest based on given clues. Despite its effectiveness, this approach suffers from low computational efficiency. Recent advancements in state space models, notably the latest work Mamba, have shown comparable performance to Transformer-based methods while significantly reducing computational complexity in various tasks. However, Mamba's applicability in target sound extraction is limited due to its inability to capture dependencies between different sequences as the cross-attention does. In this paper, we propose CrossMamba for target sound extraction, which leverages the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba to compute dependencies between the given clues and the audio mixture. The calculation of Mamba can be divided to the query, key and value. We utilize the clue to generate the query and the audio mixture to derive the key and value, adhering to the principle of the cross-attention mechanism in Transformers. Experimental results from two representative target sound extraction methods validate the efficacy of the proposed CrossMamba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Next-slot OFDM-CSI Prediction: Multi-head Self-attention or State Space Model?\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The ongoing fifth-generation (5G) standardization is exploring the use of deep learning (DL) methods to enhance the new radio (NR) interface. Both in academia and industry, researchers are investigating the performance and complexity of multiple DL architecture candidates for specific one-sided and two-sided use cases such as channel state estimation (CSI) feedback, CSI prediction, beam management, and positioning. In this paper, we set focus on the CSI prediction task and study the performance and generalization of the two main DL layers that are being extensively benchmarked within the DL community, namely, multi-head self-attention (MSA) and state-space model (SSM). We train and evaluate MSA and SSM layers to predict the next slot for uplink and downlink communication scenarios over urban microcell (UMi) and urban macrocell (UMa) OFDM 5G channel models. Our numerical results demonstrate that SSMs exhibit better prediction and generalization capabilities than MSAs only for SISO cases. For MIMO scenarios, however, the MSA layer outperforms the SSM one. While both layers represent potential DL architectures for future DL-enabled 5G use cases, the overall investigation of this paper favors MSAs over SSMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state space models (SSMs) integrated with attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models and Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Taipan Model\nThe Taipan model is a novel hybrid architecture that combines Mamba-2 (a state space model) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This integration allows Taipan to balance the efficiency of SSMs with the performance of Transformers in memory-intensive tasks. SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and augment their representations using attention. This approach enables accurate predictions over long context lengths (up to 1 million tokens) while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### State Space Models with Local Self-Attention\nA recent study demonstrates that state-space model architectures can perform gradient-based learning and use local self-attention to enhance their expressive power. By augmenting a single structured state-space model layer with local self-attention, these models can reproduce the outputs of an implicit linear model, showing potential for scalable training and effectiveness in general tasks.\n\n## Efficient Implementations and Performance\n\n### Efficient Long-Context Modeling\nState space models like Mamba and its variants have shown superior performance over Transformers in tasks requiring long-context understanding. These models scale linearly with the context window, unlike Transformers which scale quadratically, making them more efficient for long sequences. The use of bidirectional SSMs can further enhance performance by capturing both forward and backward dependencies.\n\n### Selective State Spaces\nThe concept of selective state spaces, as seen in the Taipan model, can be extended to other domains like video generation. Here, SSMs are used as temporal feature extractors, reducing the computational costs associated with traditional attention layers. This approach achieves better performance with comparable GPU memory usage, indicating its potential for efficient long-context modeling in various tasks.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Directions\n\n### Hierarchical Attention and Sparse Patterns\nCombining hierarchical chunking with two-level attention mechanisms, as suggested in the analysis, can be further optimized using SSMs. The integration of sparse attention patterns, such as those in the \"Faster Causal Attention\" approach, can reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance. SSMs can leverage these sparse patterns to enhance their efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nHardware-aware implementations are crucial for real performance gains. The use of SSMs, which have linear-time memory consumption, can be optimized further with hardware-aware designs. This ensures that the models not only perform well in terms of computational efficiency but also in real-world deployment scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the integration of state space models with attention mechanisms, such as in the Taipan model, and the use of local self-attention and sparse attention patterns, offer promising directions for improving the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models. These approaches can help in managing long-range dependencies efficiently, reducing computational overhead, and scaling better with larger models and more data.\n",

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.

Fig. 2 shows overall $2-3 \\times$ speedup over FFTConv with cuFFT using our techniques (block FFT, state-passing). Simple kernel fusion (even without block FFT) can yield speedup over cuFFT for short sequences, since memory reads/writes are the bottleneck for short sequences. For long sequences, SSMs using state passing can be dozens of times faster than even the fastest attention implementation.

Our exploration based on synthetic language tasks motivated us to design the H3 layer, which is surprisingly competitive with attention. Our BlockFFTCONV algorithm exploits matrix multiplication units and the dual recurrent-convolution view of SSMs to substantially speed up SSMs, reducing the hardware barrier between attention and SSMs. We are excited about several future directions. Our H3 layer is a simple combination of two SSMs, and more sophisticated designs could be more expressive. Our encouraging results on language models up to 1.3B parameters suggests that scaling SSMs to larger sizes is a promising avenue. Since simply adding two attention layers to H3 models already outperforms both the pure H3 model and Transformers, we are optimistic about combining the complementary strengths of SSMs and attention in the future. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Albert Gu for helpful discussion regarding the model architecture, and more importantly for sending us daily hippo videos.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient ssm attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Mamba4Rec: Towards Efficient Sequential Recommendation with Selective State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient ssm attention*\n\n*James Caverlee, Hanzhou Liu, Jianling Wang, Jianghao Lin, Chengkai Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential recommendation aims to estimate the dynamic user preferences and sequential dependencies among historical user behaviors. Although Transformer-based models have proven to be effective for sequential recommendation, they suffer from the inference inefficiency problem stemming from the quadratic computational complexity of attention operators, especially for long behavior sequences. Inspired by the recent success of state space models (SSMs), we propose Mamba4Rec, which is the first work to explore the potential of selective SSMs for efficient sequential recommendation. Built upon the basic Mamba block which is a selective SSM with an efficient hardware-aware parallel algorithm, we design a series of sequential modeling techniques to further promote model performance while maintaining inference efficiency. Through experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate how Mamba4Rec effectively tackles the effectiveness-efficiency dilemma, outperforming both RNN- and attention-based baselines in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/chengkai-liu/Mamba4Rec.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hardware-efficient implementations of hybrid State Space Models (SSMs) and attention architectures, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Hybrid Architectures and Efficiency\n\n### E-Tamba: Transformer-Mamba Hybrid\nThe E-Tamba approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer and SSM models to create hybrid architectures. This method achieves significant memory savings (up to 3X) compared to pure Transformer models, while maintaining competitive performance in language modeling and downstream NLP tasks. This hybrid design leverages the memory efficiency of SSMs and the long-context processing strengths of Transformers.\n\n### Falcon Mamba\nFalcon Mamba 7B, a pure SSM design, demonstrates that even without hybridization, SSMs can achieve faster inference and lower memory requirements for long sequence generation. This model is significantly faster and more memory-efficient than traditional Transformer models, highlighting the potential of SSMs in hardware-efficient implementations.\n\n## Computational Optimizations and Memory Access Patterns\n\n### State Space Models with Local Attention\nThe Longhorn model combines an SSM with local-attention, derived from the Taylor approximation of self-attention. This architecture enhances sampling efficiency and maintains fast training speeds, showcasing how SSMs can be integrated with attention mechanisms to improve performance while optimizing computational resources.\n\n### Sparse Sequence-to-Sequence Models\nSparse sequence-to-sequence models, such as those using the HiPPO technique and Selective Scan Algorithm, optimize memory access patterns and computational efficiency. These models reduce asymptotic complexity, making them suitable for real-time applications and efficient processing of long input sequences. The use of sparse tensors minimizes memory consumption and optimizes computation by skipping zero elements.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Implementations\n\n### Quantization and System Co-design\nThe QServe project focuses on optimizing deep language models through techniques like W4A8KV4 quantization, progressive quantization of weights, and SmoothAttention methods. These approaches reduce memory overhead and enhance inference efficiency, which is crucial for hardware-aware implementations. The adaptive bit allocation and salience-determined quantization further optimize memory usage and latency.\n\n## Practical Deployment Considerations\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Long-Context Performance\nHybrid models like E-Tamba and Falcon Mamba emphasize the importance of balancing memory efficiency with long-context processing capabilities. These models are designed to handle long sequences efficiently, reducing memory requirements during inference and training. For example, E-Tamba achieves nearly 3X memory savings compared to Transformer models, making it a viable solution for memory-limited environments.\n\n### Dynamic Routing and Position Encoding\nWhile the current references do not explicitly discuss dynamic routing between SSM and attention components, the integration of SSMs with local attention (as in Longhorn) and the use of hybrid architectures suggest that strategic combinations can address the limitations of both approaches. Position encoding and normalization techniques for SSMs are also crucial and can be explored further in the context of state space duality frameworks and dense hidden connections.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop hardware-efficient hybrid SSM-attention architectures that optimize memory access patterns, computational efficiency, and practical deployment considerations, ultimately improving the performance and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg.

Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/25 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nFor more details on different PE methods, see the survey by Dufter et al. [2022]. Zhao et al. [2023] also provides a survey focused on length generalization of PE methods. ## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel position encoding method called CoPE that measures position in a context dependent way, thus moving away from the current token-based position paradigm. This approach allows more freedom when addressing by position, and brings gains on several tasks. While this paper only focused on text and code domains, CoPE has the potential to improve domains such as video and speech where token position seems intuitively even less appropriate. Another avenue to explore is training larger models with CoPE and measuring performance on downstream tasks. ## 8 Acknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Mike Lewis for discussions and advice. ## References\n\nDzmitry Bahdanau, Kyunghyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/43 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\n694-711.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

This approach normalizes weights within blocks to ensure that the weight with the largest magnitude in a block is always normalized to 1, which is invariant to mantissa rounding and truncation. This technique can be adapted for normalizing activations or weights in hybrid models, potentially reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n### Training Stability Improvements\nRecent normalization techniques proposed by Gilmer et al. (2023), as mentioned in, have been effective in stabilizing the training process of large models. These techniques can be integrated into hybrid architectures to improve training stability and efficiency.\n\n## Position Encoding Methods for Hybrid Architectures\n\n### Efficient Position Encoding\nWhile the provided sources do not specifically discuss novel position encoding methods, the integration of SSMs and attention mechanisms can benefit from efficient position encoding schemes. For instance, using relative position encodings or learnable position embeddings can be more memory-efficient compared to absolute position encodings. These methods can be explored in the context of hybrid models to maintain performance while reducing memory overhead.\n\n## Integration with SSMs and Attention Mechanisms\n\n### State Space Duality (SSD) Framework\nThe SSD framework, as discussed in the analysis note, allows for the efficient integration of SSMs and attention mechanisms. This framework can be a foundation for designing hybrid architectures that leverage both the strengths of SSMs and attention models, potentially incorporating memory-efficient normalization and position encoding techniques.\n\n### Block-Based Processing and State Passing\nTechniques like FlashConv, which uses block-based processing and state passing, can be adapted to improve the efficiency of hybrid models. These methods reduce memory overhead and enable efficient handling of long sequences, which is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Sharding Techniques\nSharding, as discussed in, can be employed to distribute model parameters and activations across multiple compute devices, which is essential for managing the large memory requirements of hybrid models.\n\n### Low-Rank Gradient Approximation\nThe Natural GaLore method described in reduces memory usage by approximating the optimizer state using low-rank structures. This approach can be integrated into the training of hybrid models to achieve significant memory savings without compromising performance.\n\nBy combining these techniques\u2014memory-efficient normalization, efficient position encoding, block-based processing, state passing, and sharding\u2014the researchers can design hybrid autoregressive language models that are both memory-efficient and highly performant.\n",

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

Specifically, Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations. In the particular configuration we have implemented, we end up with a powerful model that fits in a single 80GB GPU. Built at large scale, Jamba provides high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, and at the same time state-of-the-art performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations. Remarkably, the model presents strong results for up to 256K tokens context length. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. We also describe several interesting properties of these architectures which the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed, and plan to release checkpoints from various ablation runs, to encourage further exploration of this novel architecture.

RAPID: Training-free Retrieval-based Log Anomaly Detection with PLM considering Token-level information\n\n*From Search Query: performance comparison normalization techniques language models*\n\n*Pilsung Kang, Hyeongwon Kang, Yukyung Lee, Gunho No*\n\n**Abstract:** As the IT industry advances, system log data becomes increasingly crucial. Many computer systems rely on log texts for management due to restricted access to source code. The need for log anomaly detection is growing, especially in real-world applications, but identifying anomalies in rapidly accumulating logs remains a challenging task. Traditional deep learning-based anomaly detection models require dataset-specific training, leading to corresponding delays. Notably, most methods only focus on sequence-level log information, which makes the detection of subtle anomalies harder, and often involve inference processes that are difficult to utilize in real-time. We introduce RAPID, a model that capitalizes on the inherent features of log data to enable anomaly detection without training delays, ensuring real-time capability. RAPID treats logs as natural language, extracting representations using pre-trained language models. Given that logs can be categorized based on system context, we implement a retrieval-based technique to contrast test logs with the most similar normal logs. This strategy not only obviates the need for log-specific training but also adeptly incorporates token-level information, ensuring refined and robust detection, particularly for unseen logs. We also propose the core set technique, which can reduce the computational cost needed for comparison. Experimental results show that even without training on log data, RAPID demonstrates competitive performance compared to prior models and achieves the best performance on certain datasets. Through various research questions, we verified its capability for real-time detection without delay.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hypothesis tests for multiple responses regression: effect of probiotics on addiction and binge eating disorder\n\n*From Search Query: performance comparison normalization techniques language models*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Clinical trials are common in medical research where multiple non-Gaussian responses and time-dependent observations are frequent. The analysis of data from these studies requires statistical modeling techniques that take these characteristics into account. We propose a general strategy based on the Wald statistics to perform hypothesis tests like ANOVAs, MANOVAs and multiple comparison tests on regression and dispersion parameters of multivariate covariance generalized linear models (McGLMs). McGLMs provide a general statistical modeling framework for normal and non-normal multivariate data analysis along with a wide range of correlation structures. We design different simulation scenarios to verify the properties of the proposed tests. The results are promising showing that the proposed tests present the levels of confidence close to the specified one for all simulation study scenarios. Complementary to the proposal, we developed implementations in the R language to carry out the tests presented, the codes are available in the supplementary material. The proposal is motivated by the analysis of a clinical trial that aims to evaluate the effect of the use of probiotics in the control of addiction and binge eating disorder in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The subjects were separated into two groups (placebo and treatment) and evaluated at three different times. The results indicate that addiction and binge eating disorder reduce over time, but there is no difference between groups at each time point.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Ordinal Preference Optimization: Aligning Human Preferences via NDCG\n\n*From Search Query: performance comparison normalization techniques language models*\n\n*Mingzhang Yin, Yixin Wang, Yang Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse human preferences is a pivotal technique for controlling model behaviors and enhancing generation quality. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and their variants optimize language models by pairwise comparisons. However, when multiple responses are available, these approaches fall short of leveraging the extensive information in the ranking given by the reward models or human feedback. In this work, we propose a novel listwise approach named Ordinal Preference Optimization (OPO), which employs the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a widely-used ranking metric, to better utilize relative proximity within ordinal multiple responses. We develop an end-to-end preference optimization algorithm by approximating NDCG with a differentiable surrogate loss. This approach builds a connection between ranking models in information retrieval and the alignment problem. In aligning multi-response datasets assigned with ordinal rewards, OPO outperforms existing pairwise and listwise approaches on evaluation sets and general benchmarks like AlpacaEval. Moreover, we demonstrate that increasing the pool of negative samples can enhance model performance by reducing the adverse effects of trivial negatives.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, here are some key points and references that address the specified areas of interest:\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Different Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Layer Normalization**: This technique is particularly effective in stabilizing and accelerating the training of neural networks, especially in recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures. It normalizes the inputs across the features for each individual training example, which is beneficial for scenarios with varying input sizes or non-stationary data distributions.\n\n- **Text Normalization Techniques**: Various NLP text normalization techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and embedding generation are crucial for preparing data for effective analysis and model training. Techniques like subword tokenization (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece) are effective in handling out-of-vocabulary words and reducing vocabulary size.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks for Normalization Methods\n\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: For text normalization, metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure are used to evaluate the performance. For example, the Whisper normalizer uses these metrics to assess its impact on multilingual ASR models. Additionally, metrics like METEOR score are used to compare the similarity of sentences before and after normalization.\n\n- **Benchmarking**: Studies on large language models often involve benchmarking different normalization and training strategies. For instance, the performance of various normalization methods (Zero-Shot Recall, Prompt Recall, Semantic Search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is compared using accuracy metrics on specific datasets like SNOMED CT.\n\n## Integration of Normalization with Modern Architectures\n\n- **Transformers and State Space Models**: The integration of normalization techniques with transformer architectures is crucial. For example, layer normalization is a standard component in transformer models, and its adaptive variants can enhance performance. Bidirectional state space models, as mentioned in the Griffin paper, can also benefit from root mean square layer normalization and other adaptive mechanisms[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Mamba and Other Architectures**: While the provided sources do not specifically mention \"Mamba\" architectures, the general principle of integrating normalization with modern architectures involves ensuring that the normalization techniques are compatible with the architecture's design. For instance, dynamic context pruning and exponential gating with appropriate normalization can enhance the capabilities of models like xLSTM[Analysis Note].\n\n## Stability Analysis in Deep Networks\n\n- **Stability and Scaling**: Stability analysis in deep networks is critical, especially when using normalization techniques. Adaptive normalization approaches and modified memory structures can help in stabilizing and scaling the performance of deep networks. Dynamic pruning techniques can also maintain performance while reducing computation, which is essential for stability in very deep networks[Analysis Note].\n\n## Real-World Performance Data on Different Hardware Platforms\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: The efficiency of normalization techniques on different hardware platforms is a key consideration. Block-based processing methods and hardware-efficient implementations can significantly impact the performance and scalability of language models. However, the provided sources do not offer specific real-world performance data on different hardware platforms, indicating a need for further investigation in this area[Analysis Note].\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Unified Language Modeling**: Combining different training objectives (causal, non-causal, and masked language modeling) can improve the robustness and performance of language models. This unified approach can be integrated with various normalization techniques to enhance overall model performance.\n\n- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: This approach combines semantic search and generative language models, which can be particularly effective in text normalization tasks. It demonstrates strong performance in mapping medical terms to standardized vocabulary, suggesting its potential in other domains as well.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that integrate effectively with modern architectures and perform well across various hardware platforms.\n",

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/20 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2212.10554, 2022.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/30 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1803.07416, 2018.

QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Ari Holtzman, Artidoro Pagnoni, Tim Dettmers*\n\n**Abstract:** We present QLoRA, an efficient finetuning approach that reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. P-Tuning v2: Prompt Tuning Can Be Comparable to Fine-tuning Universally Across Scales and Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models*\n\n*Jie Tang, Zhilin Yang, Zhengxiao Du, Weng Lam Tam, Yicheng Fu, Kaixuan Ji, Xiao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt tuning, which only tunes continuous prompts with a frozen language model, substantially reduces per-task storage and memory usage at training. However, in the context of NLU, prior work reveals that prompt tuning does not perform well for normal-sized pretrained models. We also find that existing methods of prompt tuning cannot handle hard sequence labeling tasks, indicating a lack of universality. We present a novel empirical finding that properly optimized prompt tuning can be universally effective across a wide range of model scales and NLU tasks. It matches the performance of finetuning while having only 0.1%-3% tuned parameters. Our method P-Tuning v2 is an implementation of Deep Prompt Tuning \\cite{li2021prefix,qin2021learning} optimized and adapted for NLU. Given the universality and simplicity of P-Tuning v2, we believe it can serve as an alternative to finetuning and a strong baseline for future research.Our code and data are released at https://github.com/THUDM/P-tuning-v2.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Stochastic Gradient Methods with Layer-wise Adaptive Moments for Training of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models*\n\n*Huyen Nguyen, Ryan Leary, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Jonathan M. Cohen, Yang Zhang, Patrice Castonguay, Oleksii Hrinchuk, Jason Li, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose NovoGrad, an adaptive stochastic gradient descent method with layer-wise gradient normalization and decoupled weight decay. In our experiments on neural networks for image classification, speech recognition, machine translation, and language modeling, it performs on par or better than well tuned SGD with momentum and Adam or AdamW. Additionally, NovoGrad (1) is robust to the choice of learning rate and weight initialization, (2) works well in a large batch setting, and (3) has two times smaller memory footprint than Adam.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the aspects of adaptive normalization, multi-scale processing, hardware efficiency, and state space duality, here are some relevant findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and details:\n\n## Dynamic or Adaptive Normalization Techniques in Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of weight standardization, as discussed in the context of federated learning, can be relevant. Weight standardization normalizes the weights of layers instead of activations, which can be less susceptible to mismatched client statistics and inconsistent averaging. This technique could be adapted for language models to enhance robustness and stability during training.\n\n- The paper on Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) mentions the use of RMS normalization in the context of language models. While it does not introduce a new normalization technique, it highlights the importance of adaptive adjustments during training, which could be extended to dynamic normalization methods.\n\n## Multi-scale Processing in Language Models\n\n- The proposal itself mentions multi-scale RMS normalization with adaptive gating. To further investigate this, looking into how different scales are selected and how they impact memory efficiency and gradient flow would be crucial. The ADO paper provides insights into dynamic adjustments of data distributions, which could be analogous to adjusting normalization scales based on the input context.\n\n- Multi-scale processing can also be related to the concept of hierarchical or progressive models, such as those seen in image generation models like StyleGAN, where progressive growth mechanisms are used. Adapting such mechanisms for language models could involve layer-wise or block-wise processing at different scales.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- The ADO paper discusses the use of RMS normalization in a hardware-efficient context, particularly within the Llama 2 family of Transformer-based language models. It highlights the use of SwiGLU MLP layers, RMS normalization, and rotary embeddings, which are designed to be computationally efficient.\n\n- For block-based processing, the initial analysis suggests focusing on hardware-aware designs. This could involve optimizing memory access patterns and parallelization potential. Research on efficient linear attention mechanisms, such as \"Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention,\" could provide valuable insights into how to implement block-based processing efficiently.\n\n## Applications of State Space Duality in Transformers\n\n- The reference to \"Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\" (Dao & Gu, 2024) is directly relevant. This work explores how state space models can be applied to Transformers, potentially leading to more efficient algorithms and better scalability. Integrating state space duality principles into the adaptive normalization and multi-scale processing framework could enhance the model's performance and efficiency.\n\n## Block-Based Processing for Efficient Memory Management\n\n- The ADO paper and the initial analysis both point towards the importance of block-based processing for efficient memory management. By dividing the processing into blocks, the model can manage memory more effectively, especially during training large models. This approach aligns with the hardware-efficient implementation goals.\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Generation**: Investigate how dynamic parameter generation compares to existing adaptive normalization methods. The weight standardization technique from federated learning could be a starting point.\n\n- **Optimal Scale Selection**: Research on optimal scale selection for multi-scale processing could involve analyzing the impact of different scales on gradient flow and memory efficiency. This might involve experiments with varying scale configurations to find the optimal balance between computational overhead and performance gains.\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Study real-world performance on different hardware configurations to understand the practical implications of the proposed model. This includes analyzing memory access patterns and exploring parallelization potential to maximize hardware efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and leveraging the insights from the referenced papers, the researchers can develop a more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers for Near-Infinite Context (Avg.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/97 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nIn M.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.19)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Modeling Hierarchical Structures with Continuous Recursive Neural Networks  (Avg.

However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent structure in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to rely on surrogate gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher bias or variance. In this work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations. This is done by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves strong performance in challenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference and ListOps. We also show that CRvNN performs comparably or better than prior latent structure models on real-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/40 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 5(2):157-166, 1994.

ADOP: Approximate Differentiable One-Pixel Point Rendering\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter generation neural networks*\n\n*Marc Stamminger, Linus Franke, Darius R\u00fcckert*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we present ADOP, a novel point-based, differentiable neural rendering pipeline. Like other neural renderers, our system takes as input calibrated camera images and a proxy geometry of the scene, in our case a point cloud. To generate a novel view, the point cloud is rasterized with learned feature vectors as colors and a deep neural network fills the remaining holes and shades each output pixel. The rasterizer renders points as one-pixel splats, which makes it very fast and allows us to compute gradients with respect to all relevant input parameters efficiently. Furthermore, our pipeline contains a fully differentiable physically-based photometric camera model, including exposure, white balance, and a camera response function. Following the idea of inverse rendering, we use our renderer to refine its input in order to reduce inconsistencies and optimize the quality of its output. In particular, we can optimize structural parameters like the camera pose, lens distortions, point positions and features, and a neural environment map, but also photometric parameters like camera response function, vignetting, and per-image exposure and white balance. Because our pipeline includes photometric parameters, e.g.~exposure and camera response function, our system can smoothly handle input images with varying exposure and white balance, and generates high-dynamic range output. We show that due to the improved input, we can achieve high render quality, also for difficult input, e.g. with imperfect camera calibrations, inaccurate proxy geometry, or varying exposure. As a result, a simpler and thus faster deep neural network is sufficient for reconstruction. In combination with the fast point rasterization, ADOP achieves real-time rendering rates even for models with well over 100M points. https://github.com/darglein/ADOP\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-13\n\n\n\n#### 2.

As the emerging spiking deep learning paradigm attracts increasing interest, traditional programming frameworks cannot meet the demands of the automatic differentiation, parallel computation acceleration, and high integration of processing neuromorphic datasets and deployment. In this work, we present the SpikingJelly framework to address the aforementioned dilemma. We contribute a full-stack toolkit for pre-processing neuromorphic datasets, building deep SNNs, optimizing their parameters, and deploying SNNs on neuromorphic chips. Compared to existing methods, the training of deep SNNs can be accelerated $11\\times$, and the superior extensibility and flexibility of SpikingJelly enable users to accelerate custom models at low costs through multilevel inheritance and semiautomatic code generation. SpikingJelly paves the way for synthesizing truly energy-efficient SNN-based machine intelligence systems, which will enrich the ecology of neuromorphic computing.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-25\n\n\n\n#### 3.

This is achieved through the conceptor framework, which allows the network to dynamically adjust its internal representation to follow a desired target. This approach can enhance the network's functionality and robustness, which is crucial for dynamic parameter generation.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Dynamic Parameter Approaches\n\n- The stability of adaptive networks is a key aspect. The paper in demonstrates how adaptive networks can stabilize against partial network degradation and robustness against input distortion. This stability analysis is essential for ensuring that dynamic parameter generation does not lead to unstable or unpredictable behavior in the network.\n\n## Gradient Flow Optimization in Multi-scale Architectures\n\n- For multi-scale architectures, the integration of different scales and the impact on gradient flow are critical. While the provided sources do not directly address gradient flow in multi-scale architectures, the concept of using adaptive learning rates and momentum, as mentioned in, can be extended to multi-scale settings. Adaptive learning rates can help in optimizing the gradient flow across different scales, ensuring that the network converges efficiently.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques for Parameter Generation\n\n- Hardware-specific optimizations are vital for efficient parameter generation. The analysis from the researcher's summary highlights the importance of memory access patterns and block-based processing for better hardware utilization. While the provided sources do not delve into hardware-specific optimizations, the general principle of optimizing memory access and using block-based processing, as hinted in the summary, can be applied to dynamic parameter generation to enhance hardware efficiency.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Dynamic Parameters\n\n- Memory efficiency is a significant concern for dynamic parameter generation. The concept of dynamic context pruning, mentioned in the researcher's analysis, reduces memory and computational requirements during inference by pruning up to 80% of the context without significant performance degradation. This approach can be adapted for dynamic parameter generation to ensure memory-efficient implementations.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Adaptive Learning Rates and Momentum**: Using adaptive learning rates and momentum, as described in, can help in optimizing the training process and ensuring that the network adapts efficiently to changing conditions.\n- **Multi-scale Processing**: Integrating block-based approaches with state space models, as suggested in the researcher's analysis, can offer potential benefits in terms of scalability and memory efficiency.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Optimizing memory access patterns and using block-based processing can significantly improve hardware utilization and efficiency, which is crucial for dynamic parameter generation.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage dynamic parameter generation, stability analysis, and hardware-specific optimizations.\n",

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1803.07416, 2018.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture. We support our insights with empirical results from more than 25,000 trained models.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer V2: Scaling Up Capacity and Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: language model normalization techniques state space*\n\n*Baining Guo, Furu Wei, Li Dong, Zheng Zhang, Yue Cao, Jia Ning, Yixuan Wei, Zhenda Xie, Zhuliang Yao, Yutong Lin, Han Hu, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536$\\times$1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.

A Comparison of Adaptation Techniques and Recurrent Neural Network Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: language model normalization techniques state space*\n\n*Jan Zelinka, Jan Vanek, Josef Psutka, Josef Michalek*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, recurrent neural networks have become state-of-the-art in acoustic\nmodeling for automatic speech recognition. The long short-term memory (LSTM)\nunits are the most popular ones. However, alternative units like gated\nrecurrent unit (GRU) and its modifications outperformed LSTM in some\npublications. In this paper, we compared five neural network (NN) architectures\nwith various adaptation and feature normalization techniques. We have evaluated\nfeature-space maximum likelihood linear regression, five variants of i-vector\nadaptation and two variants of cepstral mean normalization. The most adaptation\nand normalization techniques were developed for feed-forward NNs and, according\nto results in this paper, not all of them worked also with RNNs. For\nexperiments, we have chosen a well known and available TIMIT phone recognition\ntask. The phone recognition is much more sensitive to the quality of AM than\nlarge vocabulary task with a complex language model. Also, we published the\nopen-source scripts to easily replicate the results and to help continue the\ndevelopment.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on normalization techniques, integration of state space principles, hardware-efficient implementations, memory management, and adaptive or dynamic normalization approaches, here are some key findings and suggestions from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Normalization Techniques in Language Models\n\n1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**\n   RAG combines semantic search and generative language models, which can enhance normalization by fetching relevant context from external databases. This approach has shown promising results in text normalization tasks, especially in medical text normalization, achieving high accuracy by synthesizing information from retrieved entries and the model's pre-existing knowledge.\n\n2. **Semantic Search and Embedding Models:**\n   Using semantic search and embedding models (e.g., Sentence Transformers) can improve the accuracy of text normalization by projecting medical terms and standardized vocabulary into a high-dimensional space where semantically similar terms are closer together.\n\n3. **Text Cleaning and Tokenization:**\n   Basic normalization techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and embedding generation are essential for standardizing text data, making it easier to process and analyze in language models.\n\n## Integration of State Space Principles\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of state space principles with normalization layers, the concept can be inferred from dynamic and adaptive approaches:\n\n1. **Dynamic Parameter Generation:**\n   Techniques like self-supervised learning and adaptive hidden states can be seen as analogous to state space models, where the model's parameters or hidden states adapt dynamically based on the input or context. This approach can be extended to normalization layers by making them context-aware and adaptive.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization\n\n1. **Layer Normalization Techniques:**\n   Applying layer normalization after specific layers (e.g., QKV, Proj, FC2 layers) can improve training stability and reduce the risk of model divergence. This approach allows for higher learning rates without divergence, which can be hardware-efficient by reducing the need for extensive computational resources.\n\n2. **Precision and Data Types:**\n   Using mixed precision (e.g., bfloat16 for linear layers and float32 for optimizer weights) can be hardware-efficient and help in managing computational resources effectively.\n\n## Memory Management Strategies for Normalization in Transformers\n\n1. **Blockwise Computation:**\n   Techniques like blockwise computation, as seen in Ring Attention, can distribute long sequences across multiple devices, overlapping communication with computation to manage memory efficiently. This approach can be applied to normalization layers to reduce memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Memory Hierarchy Considerations:**\n   Efficient memory management involves considering the memory hierarchy and optimizing data access patterns. This can be crucial for large-scale models where normalization layers need to process vast amounts of data[Analysis Note].\n\n## Adaptive or Dynamic Normalization Approaches\n\n1. **Layer Normalization After QKV Layer:**\n   Removing pre-normalization and applying layer normalization after the QKV layer can be seen as a dynamic approach, allowing for more stable training and better performance. This method can adapt to the model's needs by normalizing the outputs of the QKV layer directly.\n\n2. **Combination of QK Layer Normalization and Softmax Capping:**\n   This method combines layer normalization with softmax capping, which can dynamically adjust the attention weights to prevent divergence and improve stability, making it an adaptive normalization approach.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers can explore:\n\n- **Advanced Normalization Techniques:** Such as RAG and semantic search-based normalization.\n- **Dynamic and Adaptive Normalization:** By integrating state space principles and using self-supervised learning approaches.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations:** Through mixed precision and optimized layer normalization techniques.\n- **Memory Management:** By employing blockwise computation and optimizing data access patterns.\n- **Adaptive Normalization:** Using methods like layer normalization after QKV layers and combining QK layer normalization with softmax capping.\n",

While HierarchicalRMSNorm introduced multi-scale normalization, it lacks dynamic adaptability to input contexts. Additionally, existing normalization techniques often struggle to balance computational efficiency with the ability to capture dependencies at different scales.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Challenges:\n1. **Static Normalization**: Current approaches use fixed normalization parameters, limiting adaptability to varying input patterns\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: Traditional normalization requires storing multiple sets of statistics, increasing memory overhead\n3. **Scale Integration**: Existing methods struggle to effectively combine information from different hierarchical levels\n4. **Computational Cost**: Standard normalization operations can become bottlenecks in large-scale models\n\n### Core Requirements:\n1. Dynamic adaptation to input context\n2. Efficient memory utilization\n3. Effective multi-scale processing\n4. Hardware-efficient implementation\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nAdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm introduces a novel approach to normalization that combines:\n1. Dynamic parameter generation based on input context\n2. Efficient multi-scale processing through state space duality\n3. Memory-efficient implementation through block-based computation\n4. Hardware-aware design for optimal performance\n\nThe key insight is that normalization parameters should adapt to both the local and global context of the input sequence, enabling more effective feature normalization while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Modified RMSNorm Architecture\n\nThe AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm consists of three main components:\n\n1. **Multi-scale Statistics Computation**:\n```python\ndef compute_scale_statistics(x, scales=[1, 2, 4]):\n    stats = []\n    for scale in scales:\n        # Compute block-wise statistics\n        x_blocks = rearrange(x, 'b (l s) d -> b l s d', s=scale)\n        rms = torch.sqrt(x_blocks.pow(2).mean(dim=(2, 3), keepdim=True) + eps)\n        stats.append(rms)\n    return stats\n```\n\n2. **Dynamic Parameter Generation**:\n```python\ndef generate_parameters(x, hidden_dim):\n    # Context-aware parameter generation\n    context = self.context_proj(x)  # [B, L, H]\n    gamma = self.gamma_net(context)  # [B, L, D]\n    beta = self.beta_net(context)   # [B, L, D]\n    return gamma, beta\n```\n\n3. **Adaptive Scale Integration**:\n```python\ndef integrate_scales(x, stats, gamma, beta):\n    outputs = []\n    for scale, rms in zip(self.scales, stats):\n        # Normalize and scale\n        x_norm = x / rms\n        x_scaled = x_norm * gamma + beta\n        outputs.append(x_scaled)\n    \n    # Adaptive integration\n    weights = self.scale_attention(x)  # [B, L, S]\n    return sum(w * o for w, o in zip(weights, outputs))\n```\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **Multi-scale RMS Statistics**:\n   For each scale s \u2208 S:\n   \\[\n   \\text{RMS}_s(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{s \\cdot d}\\sum_{i=1}^s\\sum_{j=1}^d x_{i,j}^2 + \\epsilon}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Dynamic Parameter Generation**:\n   \\[\n   \\gamma(x) = f_{\\gamma}(h(x)), \\beta(x) = f_{\\beta}(h(x))\n   \\]\n   where h(x) is a context encoding function and f_\u03b3, f_\u03b2 are learnable transformations\n\n3. **Scale Integration**:\n   \\[\n   y = \\sum_{s \\in S} w_s(x) \\cdot (\\frac{x}{\\text{RMS}_s(x)} \\cdot \\gamma(x) + \\beta(x))\n   \\]\n   where w_s(x) are learned attention weights\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Memory Management**:\n```python\nclass AdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, dim, scales=[1, 2, 4], eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.dim = dim\n        self.scales = scales\n        self.eps = eps\n        \n        # Parameter generation networks\n        self.context_proj = nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n        self.gamma_net = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(dim, dim),\n            nn.SiLU(),\n            nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n        )\n        self.beta_net = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(dim, dim),\n            nn.SiLU(),\n            nn.Linear(dim, dim)\n        )\n        \n        # Scale integration\n        self.scale_attention = nn.Linear(dim, len(scales))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Compute multi-scale statistics\n        stats = compute_scale_statistics(x, self.scales)\n        \n        # Generate dynamic parameters\n        gamma, beta = generate_parameters(x, self.dim)\n        \n        # Integrate scales\n        return integrate_scales(x, stats, gamma, beta)\n```\n\n2. **Block-based Processing**:\n- Implement block-wise computation for memory efficiency\n- Use state space duality principles for efficient sequence processing\n- Leverage hardware-specific optimizations (e.g., tensor cores)\n\n3. **Optimization Considerations**:\n- Use mixed precision training\n- Implement gradient checkpointing\n- Employ efficient memory access patterns\n\n## Research Summary\n\nKey findings from research that influenced the design:\n1. State space duality enables efficient integration of multi-scale processing\n2. Block-based computation reduces memory overhead\n3. Dynamic parameter generation improves adaptability\n4. Hardware-aware implementation crucial for performance\n\n## Evolution of Design\n\nThe design evolved through several iterations:\n1. Initial focus on simple hierarchical normalization\n2. Addition of dynamic parameter generation\n3. Integration of state space duality principles\n4. Optimization for hardware efficiency\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\n### Advantages:\n1. **Improved Adaptability**: Dynamic parameters enable better adaptation to varying input patterns\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: Block-based processing reduces memory overhead\n3. **Enhanced Feature Normalization**: Multi-scale processing captures dependencies at different levels\n4. **Hardware Efficiency**: Design optimized for modern hardware architectures\n\n### Trade-offs:\n1. **Computational Overhead**: Dynamic parameter generation adds some computation\n2. **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than standard normalization\n3. **Tuning Requirements**: Multiple components need careful initialization\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdaptiveHierarchicalRMSNorm represents a significant advancement in normalization techniques for language models.
