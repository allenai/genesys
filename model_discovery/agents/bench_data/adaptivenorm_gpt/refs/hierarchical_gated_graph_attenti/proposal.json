This integration is designed to enhance autoregressive language models by capturing both local and global dependencies in long sequences, thereby improving performance, adaptability, scalability, and computational efficiency.\n\n**Key Insights from Search Results:**\n\n- **Integrated Approaches:** While several studies have explored components similar to those in HG-GAT, such as hierarchical normalization (e.g., **HierarchicalRMSNorm**) and graph-based attention mechanisms (e.g., **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**), the **specific integration** of these elements within an autoregressive Transformer architecture remains relatively unexplored. Notable exceptions include works like **LUKE-Graph** and **GATE**, which integrate graph attention into Transformers but do not combine it with hierarchical multi-scale normalization in the same manner as HG-GAT.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:** Existing research, such as **Fast Multipole Attention** and **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling**, demonstrates methods to reduce the computational complexity of attention mechanisms, aligning with HG-GAT\u2019s objectives to maintain or improve efficiency despite additional components.\n\n- **Dynamic Context Handling:** Techniques like **Dynamic Context Pruning** highlight the importance of managing context dynamically to enhance efficiency, which complements HG-GAT\u2019s use of dynamic gating mechanisms to control information flow.\n\n- **Theoretical and Practical Foundations:** The mathematical formulations and architectural designs of related works provide a strong foundation for HG-GAT, ensuring that the proposed integrations are both theoretically sound and practically feasible.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Highlights and Concerns**\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n1. **Novel Integration:** HG-GAT uniquely combines hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and graph-based attention within a Transformer architecture. This novel integration promises to leverage the strengths of each component, potentially leading to superior performance in capturing complex dependencies over long sequences.\n\n2. **Enhanced Performance on Long Sequences:** By addressing both local and global dependencies, HG-GAT is well-positioned to handle long contexts more effectively than traditional Transformers, which often struggle with quadratic complexity in self-attention.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency:** Drawing inspiration from efficient attention mechanisms like **Fast Multipole Attention**, HG-GAT incorporates strategies to mitigate the computational overhead introduced by additional normalization and attention layers, aiming to maintain or enhance overall efficiency.\n\n4. **Adaptability and Scalability:** The dynamic gating mechanisms allow HG-GAT to adaptively control information flow based on input characteristics, enhancing the model's adaptability. Combined with multi-scale normalization, this contributes to the model's scalability across varying sequence lengths and complexities.\n\n5. **Theoretical Soundness:** The proposal is grounded in established normalization and attention mechanisms, with clear mathematical formulations supporting the integration of hierarchical normalization and graph-based attention.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. **Implementation Complexity:** The integration of multiple advanced components\u2014hierarchical normalization, dynamic gating, and graph-based attention\u2014introduces significant architectural complexity. Ensuring seamless interaction between these components without introducing bugs or inefficiencies may be challenging.\n\n2. **Computational Overhead:** Despite efforts to enhance efficiency, the added layers for hierarchical normalization and graph-based attention could increase computational and memory demands, especially for very long sequences. Balancing the depth and breadth of these components to maintain efficiency is crucial.\n\n3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Combining multiple mechanisms may introduce additional hyperparameters (e.g., scale factors, gating weights) that require careful tuning to achieve optimal performance. This could complicate the training process and model optimization.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation Needed:** While the theoretical foundations are robust, empirical results are necessary to validate the proposed benefits of HG-GAT. Specifically, benchmarking against existing models on relevant tasks will be essential to demonstrate improvements in perplexity, accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n\n5. **Potential Redundancies:** There is a risk that some of the functionalities introduced by hierarchical normalization and graph-based attention might overlap or redundantly capture similar dependencies, potentially limiting the overall effectiveness of the integration.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Evaluation of the Design**\n\n**Clarity:**\nThe proposal is clearly articulated, outlining the motivations, problem analysis, core ideas, and detailed design plans. The mathematical formulations and pseudo-code provided offer a comprehensive understanding of how the components interact within the HG-GAT architecture.\n\n**Innovation:**\nHG-GAT introduces a **novel integration** of hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and graph-based attention within Transformer architectures. While individual components have been explored in isolation, their combined application in autoregressive language models appears innovative and has not been extensively studied in existing literature.\n\n**Feasibility:**\nThe proposed design is theoretically sound, leveraging established mechanisms like RMSNorm and GATs. However, the practical implementation may present challenges due to the complexity of integrating multiple components. Ensuring computational efficiency and seamless interactions between hierarchical normalization and graph-based attention will be critical for successful implementation.\n\n**Scalability:**\nHG-GAT is designed with scalability in mind, aiming to handle long sequences efficiently by capturing dependencies at multiple scales and through graph-based attention. Drawing from methods like **Fast Multipole Attention** suggests that the design can scale effectively, provided that computational optimizations are adequately applied.\n\n**Accuracy and Robustness:**\nBy capturing both local and global dependencies, HG-GAT has the potential to improve model accuracy and robustness in handling diverse and complex inputs. The dynamic gating mechanisms further enhance robustness by adaptively managing information flow based on input characteristics.\n\n**Efficiency:**\nThe proposal acknowledges the potential computational overhead introduced by additional normalization and attention layers, proposing integration strategies inspired by efficient attention mechanisms to mitigate this. However, empirical evaluations will be necessary to confirm whether HG-GAT achieves the desired efficiency improvements.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1. **Detailed Implementation Plan:**\n   - **Component Interactions:** Provide a more granular overview of how hierarchical normalization and graph-based attention mechanisms interact within the Transformer architecture. This could include sequence diagrams or flow charts illustrating data flow and dependencies.\n   \n2. **Computational Optimizations:**\n   - **Sparse and Linear Attention:** Incorporate or reference existing efficient attention mechanisms (e.g., sparse attention, linear attention) to further reduce computational overhead.\n   - **Parameter Sharing:** Explore techniques for parameter sharing across hierarchical scales to reduce the total number of parameters and enhance computational efficiency.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation Framework:**\n   - **Benchmarking:** Design a comprehensive benchmarking plan to evaluate HG-GAT against standard Transformers and other state-of-the-art models on benchmarks that emphasize long sequence processing.\n   - **Ablation Studies:** Conduct ablation studies to isolate and understand the impact of each integrated component (hierarchical normalization, gating mechanisms, graph attention) on overall performance.\n\n4. **Hyperparameter Management:**\n   - **Automated Tuning:** Implement automated hyperparameter tuning strategies to efficiently navigate the increased hyperparameter space introduced by the integrated components.\n   \n5. **Theoretical Analysis:**\n   - **Convergence and Stability:** Provide theoretical proofs or analyses demonstrating the stability and convergence properties of the integrated HG-GAT model during training.\n   - **Expressiveness:** Analyze the expressiveness of HG-GAT compared to standard Transformers, highlighting any theoretical advantages provided by the integration.\n\n6. **Implementation Complexity Mitigation:**\n   - **Modular Design:** Adopt a modular architecture where hierarchical normalization, gating mechanisms, and graph-based attention are encapsulated within separate, interchangeable modules. This can facilitate easier debugging, testing, and potential future enhancements.\n   \n7. **Scalability Strategies:**\n   - **Distributed Training:** Explore distributed training strategies that leverage data and model parallelism to handle the increased complexity and memory demands of HG-GAT.\n   - **Memory-Efficient Operations:** Utilize memory-efficient operations and gradient checkpointing to manage the memory footprint during training, especially for very long sequences.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Final Rating**\n\n```rating 4.3```\n\n---\n\n#### **Justification for Rating: 4.3**\n\nThe **Hierarchical Gated Graph Attention Transformer (HG-GAT)** proposal presents a highly innovative and well-structured approach to enhancing autoregressive language models by combining hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and graph-based attention.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.15)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.11)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures. The source code is released at github.com/OpenNLPLab/TransnormerLLM.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/39 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nHS: HellaSwag.

TNL Ablation\n\nWe conducted an extensive ablation analysis on various components of TNL, including positional encoding, gating mechanisms, GLA activation functions, GLU activation functions, and normalization functions.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that integrates hierarchical multi-scale normalization, gating mechanisms, and graph-based convolutions to improve the performance of language models. Here are the key points and the most relevant information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical Normalization and Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical RMSNorm**: The researcher aims to use a hierarchical version of RMSNorm, which normalizes features at multiple scales. This technique is expected to enhance the model's ability to capture hierarchical patterns in data. The concept of RMSNorm is discussed in, where it is shown to be efficient and beneficial over traditional LayerNorm in various NLP tasks.\n\n## Incorporation of Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Linear Units (GLU)**: The use of gating mechanisms, such as GLU or its variants (e.g., GeGLU, SwiGLU), can dynamically control the information flow. These mechanisms are detailed in, which explains how GLU and its variants can be used to improve the adaptability and performance of neural networks.\n\n## Graph-Based Convolutions\n\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: To capture complex relational dependencies between tokens, the researcher plans to incorporate graph convolutional operations, particularly those using attention mechanisms. GATs, as described in the references and further detailed in, are highly relevant here. They enable the model to focus on different parts of the graph (or sequence) when computing the representation of each node (or token), which can be crucial for understanding global context.\n\n## Addressing Computational Complexity and Parameter Management\n\n- **Efficient Implementations**: To manage the increased computational complexity, the researcher should consider using sparse graph representations or approximate graph convolutions. This is hinted at in the analysis but can be further explored through techniques discussed in papers like and, which talk about efficient graph convolution techniques and their applications.\n- **Shared Parameters**: To balance the additional parameters, employing shared parameters where possible can help minimize the parameter increase and prevent overfitting. This approach is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources but is a common strategy in deep learning.\n\n## Key Insights and References\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization and Gating**: Combining hierarchical normalization with gating mechanisms can adaptively normalize inputs at multiple scales while controlling information flow. This is a core idea in the researcher's analysis.\n- **Graph-Based Convolutions**: Incorporating graph convolutions, especially those using attention (like GAT), can enhance the model's understanding of global context and relational dependencies. This is supported by the references on GNNs and GATs.\n\n### Most Useful Information\n\n1. **RMSNorm and Hierarchical Normalization**:\n   - The paper on RMSNorm provides insights into how normalization techniques can be optimized, which is crucial for the hierarchical RMSNorm integration.\n   - The discussion on pre-layer normalization and its variants in also highlights the importance of normalization in transformers.\n\n2. **Gating Mechanisms**:\n   - The detailed explanation of GLU and its variants in will be essential for implementing gating mechanisms effectively.\n\n3. **Graph Attention Networks**:\n   - The paper on GATs is a key reference for understanding how to incorporate graph convolutional operations using attention mechanisms, which is vital for capturing global dependencies.\n\n4. **Efficient Graph Convolution Techniques**:\n   - Papers like and provide insights into efficient graph convolution techniques that can be adapted for sequence modeling tasks, helping to manage computational complexity.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel GAU that integrates hierarchical normalization, gating mechanisms, and graph-based convolutions, potentially leading to improved performance in language models.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical RMSNorm*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9542  (*Influential: 1894*)\n\n#### 2.

Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin.

Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

DualGATs: Dual Graph Attention Networks for Emotion Recognition in Conversations\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Duzhen Zhang, Feilong Chen, Xiuyi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC.\n\n**Abstract:** Capturing complex contextual dependencies plays a vital role in Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC). Previous studies have predominantly focused on speaker-aware context modeling, overlooking the discourse structure of the conversation. In this paper, we introduce Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC. Specifically, we devise a Discourse-aware GAT (DisGAT) module to incorporate discourse structural information by analyzing the discourse dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we develop a Speaker-aware GAT (SpkGAT) module to incorporate speaker-aware contextual information by considering the speaker dependencies between utterances. Furthermore, we design an interaction module that facilitates the integration of the DisGAT and SpkGAT modules, enabling the effective interchange of relevant information between the two modules. We extensively evaluate our method on four datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DualGATs surpass state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of the datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Transition-based Dependency Parsing Using Two Heterogeneous Gated Recursive Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Xinchi Chen, Yaqian Zhou, Chenxi Zhu, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two heterogeneous gated recursion neural networks are proposed: tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic graph structuredgated recursive Neural Network (DAG- GRNN), which integrate to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for transition-based dependency parsing.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural network based dependency parsing has attracted much interest, which can effectively alleviate the problems of data sparsity and feature engineering by using the dense features. However, it is still a challenge problem to sufficiently model the complicated syntactic and semantic compositions of the dense features in neural network based methods. In this paper, we propose two heterogeneous gated recursive neural networks: tree structured gated recursive neural network (Tree-GRNN) and directed acyclic graph structured gated recursive neural network (DAG-GRNN). Then we integrate them to automatically learn the compositions of the dense features for transition-based dependency parsing. Specifically, Tree-GRNN models the feature combinations for the trees in stack, which already have partial dependency structures. DAG-GRNN models the feature combinations of the nodes whose dependency relations have not been built yet. Experiment results on two prevalent benchmark datasets (PTB3 and CTB5) show the effectiveness of our proposed model.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Self-Attention Networks Can Process Bounded Hierarchical Languages\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Networks NLP*\n\n*Shunyu Yao, Binghui Peng, C. Papadimitriou, Karthik Narasimhan*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that self-attention networks can process Dyck-(k, D), the subset of Dyck-k with depth bounded by D, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their impressive performance in NLP, self-attention networks were recently proved to be limited for processing formal languages with hierarchical structure, such as Dyck-k, the language consisting of well-nested parentheses of k types. This suggested that natural language can be approximated well with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that the role of hierarchy and recursion in natural language might be limited. We qualify this implication by proving that self-attention networks can process Dyck-(k, D), the subset of Dyck-k with depth bounded by D, which arguably better captures the bounded hierarchical structure of natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention network with D+1 layers and O(log k) memory size (per token per layer) that recognizes Dyck-(k, D), and a soft-attention network with two layers and O(log k) memory size that generates Dyck-(k, D). Experiments show that self-attention networks trained on Dyck-(k, D) generalize to longer inputs with near-perfect accuracy, and also verify the theoretical memory advantage of self-attention networks over recurrent networks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 7. The Importance of Being Recurrent for Modeling Hierarchical Structure\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Networks NLP*\n\n*Ke M.

In contrast, the ability to model structured data with non-recurrent neural networks has received little attention despite their success in many NLP tasks (Gehring et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017). In this work, we compare the two architectures\u2014recurrent versus non-recurrent\u2014with respect to their ability to model hierarchical structure and find that recurrency is indeed important for this purpose.

Gomes, Zhixin Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism is proposed to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches to demonstrate the applicability of the theory.\n\n**Abstract:** Geometric deep learning enables the encoding of physical symmetries in modeling 3D objects. Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks.

Joint Edge-Model Sparse Learning is Provably Efficient for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu, Songtao Lu, Miaoyuan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error and proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexityand improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include \\textit{graph sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and \\textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 10.

Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work theoretically derive a closed-form solution of EIGNN which makes training an infinite-depth GNN model tractable, and shows that the model is also more robust against both noise and adversarial perturbations on node features.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for modelling graph-structured data in numerous applications. However, with their inherently finite aggregation layers, existing GNN models may not be able to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the underlying graphs. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a GNN model with infinite depth, which we call Efficient Infinite-Depth Graph Neural Networks (EIGNN), to efficiently capture very long-range dependencies. We theoretically derive a closed-form solution of EIGNN which makes training an infinite-depth GNN model tractable. We then further show that we can achieve more efficient computation for training EIGNN by using eigendecomposition. The empirical results of comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EIGNN has a better ability to capture long-range dependencies than recent baselines, and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our model is also more robust against both noise and adversarial perturbations on node features.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 11. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 12.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1314  (*Influential: 183*)\n\n#### 13. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Then, we propose a relational graph attention\nnetwork (R-GAT) to encode the new tree structure for sentiment prediction.\nExtensive experiments are conducted on the SemEval 2014 and Twitter datasets,\nand the experimental results confirm that the connections between aspects and\nopinion words can be better established with our approach, and the performance\nof the graph attention network (GAT) is significantly improved as a\nconsequence.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-26T12:21:04Z  (*Updated: 2020-04-26T12:21:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Text-Based Automatic Personality Prediction Using KGrAt-Net; A Knowledge\n  Graph Attention Network Classifier\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Majid Ramezani, Mohammad-Reza Feizi-Derakhshi, Mohammad-Ali Balafar*\n\n**Abstract:** Nowadays, a tremendous amount of human communications occur on Internet-based\ncommunication infrastructures, like social networks, email, forums,\norganizational communication platforms, etc. Indeed, the automatic prediction\nor assessment of individuals' personalities through their written or exchanged\ntext would be advantageous to ameliorate their relationships. To this end, this\npaper aims to propose KGrAt-Net, which is a Knowledge Graph Attention Network\ntext classifier. For the first time, it applies the knowledge graph attention\nnetwork to perform Automatic Personality Prediction (APP), according to the Big\nFive personality traits. After performing some preprocessing activities, it\nfirst tries to acquire a knowing-full representation of the knowledge behind\nthe concepts in the input text by building its equivalent knowledge graph. A\nknowledge graph collects interlinked descriptions of concepts, entities, and\nrelationships in a machine-readable form. Practically, it provides a\nmachine-readable cognitive understanding of concepts and semantic relationships\namong them. Then, applying the attention mechanism, it attempts to pay\nattention to the most relevant parts of the graph to predict the personality\ntraits of the input text. We used 2,467 essays from the Essays Dataset. The\nresults demonstrated that KGrAt-Net considerably improved personality\nprediction accuracies (up to 70.26% on average). Furthermore, KGrAt-Net also\nuses knowledge graph embedding to enrich the classification, which makes it\neven more accurate (on average, 72.41%) in APP.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27T06:33:09Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-05T20:05:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Graph-to-Sequence Learning using Gated Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Daniel Beck, Gholamreza Haffari, Trevor Cohn*\n\n**Abstract:** Many NLP applications can be framed as a graph-to-sequence learning problem.\nPrevious work proposing neural architectures on this setting obtained promising\nresults compared to grammar-based approaches but still rely on linearisation\nheuristics and/or standard recurrent networks to achieve the best performance.\nIn this work, we propose a new model that encodes the full structural\ninformation contained in the graph. Our architecture couples the recently\nproposed Gated Graph Neural Networks with an input transformation that allows\nnodes and edges to have their own hidden representations, while tackling the\nparameter explosion problem present in previous work. Experimental results show\nthat our model outperforms strong baselines in generation from AMR graphs and\nsyntax-based neural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-26T08:08:30Z  (*Updated: 2018-06-26T08:08:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Modeling Semantics with Gated Graph Neural Networks for Knowledge Base\n  Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Daniil Sorokin, Iryna Gurevych*\n\n**Abstract:** The most approaches to Knowledge Base Question Answering are based on\nsemantic parsing. In this paper, we address the problem of learning vector\nrepresentations for complex semantic parses that consist of multiple entities\nand relations. Previous work largely focused on selecting the correct semantic\nrelations for a question and disregarded the structure of the semantic parse:\nthe connections between entities and the directions of the relations. We\npropose to use Gated Graph Neural Networks to encode the graph structure of the\nsemantic parse. We show on two data sets that the graph networks outperform all\nbaseline models that do not explicitly model the structure. The error analysis\nconfirms that our approach can successfully process complex semantic parses.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-13T09:50:43Z  (*Updated: 2018-08-13T09:50:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. PermuteFormer: Efficient Relative Position Encoding for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Peng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer\nsequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with\nrelative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position\nencoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position\nencoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a\nPerformer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on\nlong sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long\nsequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The\nexperiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of\nPerformer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla\nTransformer on most of the tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-06T11:49:22Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-08T13:17:49Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

The Infini-attention incorporates a\ncompressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both\nmasked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single\nTransformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on\nlong-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context\nblock retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs.\nOur approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast\nstreaming inference for LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-10T16:18:42Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T22:37:25Z*)\n\n\n\n### 9 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

By stacking layers in which nodes\nare able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly)\nspecifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without\nrequiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending\non knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key\nchallenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our\nmodel readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT\nmodels have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four\nestablished transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and\nPubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction\ndataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).\n\n**Conference:** graph-attention-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. How Attentive are Graph Attention Networks?\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Eran Yahav, Uri Alon, Shaked Brody*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are one of the most popular GNN architectures and are considered as the state-of-the-art architecture for representation learning with graphs. In GAT, every node attends to its neighbors given its own representation as the query. However, in this paper we show that GAT computes a very limited kind of attention: the ranking of the attention scores is unconditioned on the query node. We formally define this restricted kind of attention as static attention and distinguish it from a strictly more expressive dynamic attention. Because GATs use a static attention mechanism, there are simple graph problems that GAT cannot express: in a controlled problem, we show that static attention hinders GAT from even fitting the training data. To remove this limitation, we introduce a simple fix by modifying the order of operations and propose GATv2: a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than GAT. We perform an extensive evaluation and show that GATv2 outperforms GAT across 11 OGB and other benchmarks while we match their parametric costs. Our code is available at https://github.com/tech-srl/how_attentive_are_gats . GATv2 is available as part of the PyTorch Geometric library, the Deep Graph Library, and the TensorFlow GNN library.\n\n**Conference:** how-attentive-are-graph-attention-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 3.

The vector representations of words\nlearned by word2vec models have been shown to carry semantic meanings and are\nuseful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like\nto experiment with word2vec or similar techniques, I notice that there lacks a\nmaterial that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word\nembedding models in details, thus preventing researchers that are non-experts\nin neural networks from understanding the working mechanism of such models.\n  This note provides detailed derivations and explanations of the parameter\nupdate equations of the word2vec models, including the original continuous\nbag-of-word (CBOW) and skip-gram (SG) models, as well as advanced optimization\ntechniques, including hierarchical softmax and negative sampling.

An Empirical Study on Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero-Shot Labels\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Networks NLP*\n\n*Ion Androutsopoulos, Nikolaos Aletras, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Sotiris Kotitsas, Manos Fergadiotis, Ilias Chalkidis*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale Multi-label Text Classification (LMTC) has a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications and presents interesting challenges. First, not all labels are well represented in the training set, due to the very large label set and the skewed label distributions of LMTC datasets. Also, label hierarchies and differences in human labelling guidelines may affect graph-aware annotation proximity. Finally, the label hierarchies are periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning, although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art method which combines BERT with LWANs. Finally, we propose new models that leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-04\n\n\n\n#### 6. Accurate, Efficient and Scalable Training of Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Ajitesh Srivastava, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful deep learning models to generate node embeddings on graphs. When applying deep GNNs on large graphs, it is still challenging to perform training in an efficient and scalable way. We propose a novel parallel training framework. Through sampling small subgraphs as minibatches, we reduce training workload by orders of magnitude compared with state-of-the-art minibatch methods. We then parallelize the key computation steps on tightly-coupled shared memory systems. For graph sampling, we exploit parallelism within and across sampler instances, and propose an efficient data structure supporting concurrent accesses from samplers. The parallel sampler theoretically achieves near-linear speedup with respect to number of processing units. For feature propagation within subgraphs, we improve cache utilization and reduce DRAM traffic by data partitioning. Our partitioning is a 2-approximation strategy for minimizing the communication cost compared to the optimal. We further develop a runtime scheduler to reorder the training operations and adjust the minibatch subgraphs to improve parallel performance. Finally, we generalize the above parallelization strategies to support multiple types of GNN models and graph samplers. The proposed training outperforms the state-of-the-art in scalability, efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. On a 40-core Xeon platform, we achieve 60x speedup (with AVX) in the sampling step and 20x speedup in the feature propagation step, compared to the serial implementation. Our algorithm enables fast training of deeper GNNs, as demonstrated by orders of magnitude speedup compared to the Tensorflow implementation.

MariusGNN: Resource-Efficient Out-of-Core Training of Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Graph Neural Networks*\n\n*Shivaram Venkataraman, Theodoros Rekatsinas, Jason Mohoney, Roger Waleffe*\n\n**Abstract:** We study training of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for large-scale graphs. We revisit the premise of using distributed training for billion-scale graphs and show that for graphs that fit in main memory or the SSD of a single machine, out-of-core pipelined training with a single GPU can outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) multi-GPU solutions. We introduce MariusGNN, the first system that utilizes the entire storage hierarchy -- including disk -- for GNN training. MariusGNN introduces a series of data organization and algorithmic contributions that 1) minimize the end-to-end time required for training and 2) ensure that models learned with disk-based training exhibit accuracy similar to those fully trained in memory. We evaluate MariusGNN against SoTA systems for learning GNN models and find that single-GPU training in MariusGNN achieves the same level of accuracy up to 8x faster than multi-GPU training in these systems, thus, introducing an order of magnitude monetary cost reduction.

Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 9.

Code is available at https://github.com/lironui/Linear-Attention-Mechanism.\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates hierarchical normalization techniques, gating mechanisms, and graph-based attention, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hierarchical Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Hierarchical RMSNorm**: The concept of hierarchical normalization can be extended from the basic RMSNorm technique. RMSNorm simplifies LayerNorm by normalizing the root mean square (RMS) of the inputs without re-centering and re-scaling, which can be more efficient and suitable for varying sequence lengths.\n  - To make it hierarchical, you can apply RMSNorm at multiple scales, allowing the model to capture different levels of contextual information. This can be achieved by applying gates to the outputs of each scale, enabling dynamic control based on the input data.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNNs)**: GGNNs incorporate gating mechanisms similar to those in Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which help in controlling the flow of information through the network. This can be particularly useful when integrating multiple components, as it allows the model to adaptively weight different parts of the input.\n  - By integrating gating mechanisms into the hierarchical normalization process, you can enable the model to dynamically adjust the importance of different scales.\n\n## Graph-Based Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)**: GATs use masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior graph convolution methods. They are computationally efficient and can capture different weights for different nodes in a neighborhood, making them suitable for modeling token interactions in sequences.\n  - Incorporating GATs into the model can help capture global dependencies without excessive computational costs. Since sequences can be represented as linear graphs, GATs can be applied to model token interactions effectively.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**: These attention techniques are designed to reduce memory bandwidth and computational overhead. GQA allocates a single KV head at each Q head group, while MQA shares a single KV head with all Q heads. These methods can be considered for efficient attention computations.\n  - Linear attention methods, such as those discussed in the context of Transformers, can also be explored to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n## Practical Implementation and Scalability\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**: When integrating graph-based operations, it is crucial to maintain computational efficiency. Strategies such as sparse attention, approximate nearest neighbor methods, or shared weights can help minimize computational overhead.\n  - The Star-Transformer architecture, which reduces complexity by connecting nodes through a shared relay node, can also be a useful reference for capturing both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Additional Search Queries and References\n\nGiven the researcher's interests, here are some additional search queries and references that could be useful:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Networks in NLP\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)**: These networks combine hierarchical structures with attention mechanisms to capture different levels of contextual information. Researching HAN can provide insights into how to integrate hierarchical attention with other components effectively.\n\n### Efficient Graph Neural Networks\n- **Scalable GNNs**: Recent papers on scalable GNNs can provide techniques for handling large graphs or sequences efficiently. This includes topology-aware message-passing schemes and other optimizations.\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- **Linear Attention in Transformers**: Papers on linear attention methods, such as those that optimize Transformer architectures for long sequences, can offer practical solutions for efficient attention computations.\n\n## Example Architecture\n\nHere is a high-level example of how the proposed architecture could be designed:\n\n### Hierarchical Gated RMSNorm Unit\n- Apply RMSNorm at multiple scales to capture hierarchical patterns.\n- Introduce gating mechanisms to dynamically weight the outputs of each scale.\n\n### Graph-Based Attention GAU\n- Use GATs to capture global dependencies in the sequence.\n- Represent the sequence as a linear graph and apply GATs to model token interactions.\n\n### Integration\n- Combine the hierarchical gated RMSNorm unit with the graph-based attention mechanism.\n- Ensure that the design reuses and adapts units from the parent models where appropriate.\n\nBy integrating these components, the novel autoregressive LM block can capture hierarchical patterns, dynamically control information flow, and capture global dependencies efficiently, potentially leading to improved performance in terms of perplexity, accuracy, robustness, and scalability.\n",

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. $\\left[\\mathrm{LKV}^{+}\\right.$18] Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Charles Windolf, and Thomas Serre.

Transformer-VQ's efficient attention is enabled by vector-quantized keys and a novel caching mechanism. In our large-scale experiments, Transformer-VQ is shown highly competitive in quality, obtaining 0.99 bpb on Enwik8, 26.6 ppl on PG-19, and 3.16 bpb on ImageNet64. In addition, the optimized implementation of Transformer-VQ is over 3x faster than a comparable quadratic-time transformer at sequence length 8k, is over 12x faster at 32k, and can scale to 131k with similar throughput.

Transformer-VQ differs from Perceivers in that it computes dense self-attention in linear time, instead of just cross-attention. Thus, while Perceivers' long-range layers incur a quadratic time complexity during sampling, TransformerVQ generates sequences in linear time. ### 4.4 Gated SEQUENCE MODELS\n\nGated attention was introduced in FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) as a fusion of attention sublayers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and GLU-based MLP sublayers (Shazeer, 2020).

Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Fisher Information Embedding for Node and Graph Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Dexiong Chen, Paolo Pellizzoni, Karsten M. Borgwardt*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel attention-based node embedding framework for graphs that leads to a new attention mechanism for neighborhood aggregation and provides theoretical insights into generalizability and expressivity of the embeddings, contributing to a deeper understanding of attention- based GNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs), such as graph attention networks (GATs), have become popular neural architectures for processing graph-structured data and learning node embeddings. Despite their empirical success, these models rely on labeled data and the theoretical properties of these models have yet to be fully understood. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based node embedding framework for graphs. Our framework builds upon a hierarchical kernel for multisets of subgraphs around nodes (e.g. neighborhoods) and each kernel leverages the geometry of a smooth statistical manifold to compare pairs of multisets, by\"projecting\"the multisets onto the manifold. By explicitly computing node embeddings with a manifold of Gaussian mixtures, our method leads to a new attention mechanism for neighborhood aggregation. We provide theoretical insights into generalizability and expressivity of our embeddings, contributing to a deeper understanding of attention-based GNNs. We propose both efficient unsupervised and supervised methods for learning the embeddings. Through experiments on several node classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing attention-based graph models like GATs.

Rumor Detection on Twitter with Claim-Guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Hongzhan Lin, Jing Ma, Mingfei Cheng, Zhiwei Yang, Liangliang Chen, Guang Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study presents a Claim-guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for rumor classification, which enhances the representation learning for responsive posts considering the entire social contexts and attends over the posts that can semantically infer the target claim.\n\n**Abstract:** Rumors are rampant in the era of social media. Conversation structures provide valuable clues to differentiate between real and fake claims. However, existing rumor detection methods are either limited to the strict relation of user responses or oversimplify the conversation structure. In this study, to substantially reinforces the interaction of user opinions while alleviating the negative impact imposed by irrelevant posts, we first represent the conversation thread as an undirected interaction graph. We then present a Claim-guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for rumor classification, which enhances the representation learning for responsive posts considering the entire social contexts and attends over the posts that can semantically infer the target claim. Extensive experiments on three Twitter datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for detecting rumors at early stages.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Graph Generation with Graph Recurrent Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Renjie Liao, Yujia Li, Yang Song, Shenlong Wang, C. Nash, William L. Hamilton, D. Duvenaud, R. Urtasun, R. Zemel*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new family of efficient and expressive deep generative models of graphs, called Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRANs), which better captures the auto-regressive conditioning between the already-generated and to-be-generated parts of the graph using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new family of efficient and expressive deep generative models of graphs, called Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRANs). Our model generates graphs one block of nodes and associated edges at a time. The block size and sampling stride allow us to trade off sample quality for efficiency. Compared to previous RNN-based graph generative models, our framework better captures the auto-regressive conditioning between the already-generated and to-be-generated parts of the graph using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with attention. This not only reduces the dependency on node ordering but also bypasses the long-term bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of RNNs. Moreover, we parameterize the output distribution per block using a mixture of Bernoulli, which captures the correlations among generated edges within the block. Finally, we propose to handle node orderings in generation by marginalizing over a family of canonical orderings. On standard benchmarks, we achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency and sample quality compared to previous models. Additionally, we show our model is capable of generating large graphs of up to 5K nodes with good quality.

Self-Instantiated Recurrent Units with Dynamic Soft Recursion\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks*\n\n*Aston Zhang, Yi Tay, Yikang Shen, Alvin Chan, Shuai Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) is proposed with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Abstract:** While standard recurrent neural networks explicitly impose a chain structure on different forms of data, they do not have an explicit bias towards recursive self-instantiation where the extent of recursion is dynamic. Given diverse and even growing data modalities (e.g., logic, algorithmic input and output, music, code, images, and language) that can be expressed in sequences and may bene\ufb01t from more architectural \ufb02exibility, we propose the self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion. On one hand, the Self-IRU is characterized by recursive self-instantiation via its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of the Self-IRU are controlled by instances of the Self-IRU itself, which are repeatedly invoked in a recursive fashion. On the other hand, the extent of the Self-IRU recursion is controlled by gates whose values are between 0 and 1 and may vary across the temporal dimension of sequences, enabling dynamic soft recursion depth at each time step. The architectural \ufb02exibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach are demonstrated across multiple data modalities. For example, the Self-IRU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset [Bowman et al., 2014] even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. GLIF: A Unified Gated Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks*\n\n*Xing-Hua Yao, Fanrong Li, Zitao Mo, Jianguo Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio- features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons and increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiker neurons.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been studied over decades to incorporate their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency. Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF, gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

TempME: Towards the Explainability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks via Motif Discovery\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks*\n\n*Jialin Chen, Rex Ying*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach, called Temporal Motifs Explainer (TempME), which uncovers the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of TGNNs, and extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation.\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal graphs are widely used to model dynamic systems with time-varying interactions. In real-world scenarios, the underlying mechanisms of generating future interactions in dynamic systems are typically governed by a set of recurring substructures within the graph, known as temporal motifs. Despite the success and prevalence of current temporal graph neural networks (TGNN), it remains uncertain which temporal motifs are recognized as the significant indications that trigger a certain prediction from the model, which is a critical challenge for advancing the explainability and trustworthiness of current TGNNs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, called Temporal Motifs Explainer (TempME), which uncovers the most pivotal temporal motifs guiding the prediction of TGNNs. Derived from the information bottleneck principle, TempME extracts the most interaction-related motifs while minimizing the amount of contained information to preserve the sparsity and succinctness of the explanation. Events in the explanations generated by TempME are verified to be more spatiotemporally correlated than those of existing approaches, providing more understandable insights. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of TempME, with up to 8.21% increase in terms of explanation accuracy across six real-world datasets and up to 22.96% increase in boosting the prediction Average Precision of current TGNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7.

Learning beyond Datasets: Knowledge Graph Augmented Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: Scalable Graph Neural Networks for NLP*\n\n*K. Annervaz, Somnath Basu Roy Chowdhury, Ambedkar Dukkipati*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by introducing a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine Learning has been the quintessential solution for many AI problems, but learning models are heavily dependent on specific training data. Some learning models can be incorporated with prior knowledge using a Bayesian setup, but these learning models do not have the ability to access any organized world knowledge on demand. In this work, we propose to enhance learning models with world knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph (KG) fact triples for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Our aim is to develop a deep learning model that can extract relevant prior support facts from knowledge graphs depending on the task using attention mechanism. We introduce a convolution-based model for learning representations of knowledge graph entity and relation clusters in order to reduce the attention space. We show that the proposed method is highly scalable to the amount of prior information that has to be processed and can be applied to any generic NLP task. Using this method we show significant improvement in performance for text classification with 20Newsgroups (News20) & DBPedia datasets, and natural language inference with Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset. We also demonstrate that a deep learning model can be trained with substantially less amount of labeled training data, when it has access to organized world knowledge in the form of a knowledge base.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9. Interpreting Graph Neural Networks for NLP With Differentiable Edge Masking\n\n*From Search Query: Scalable Graph Neural Networks for NLP*\n\n*M. Schlichtkrull, Nicola De Cao, Ivan Titov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges and uses this technique as an attribution method to analyze GNN models for two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling -- providing insights into the information flow in these models.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a popular approach to integrating structural inductive biases into NLP models. However, there has been little work on interpreting them, and specifically on understanding which parts of the graphs (e.g. syntactic trees or co-reference structures) contribute to a prediction. In this work, we introduce a post-hoc method for interpreting the predictions of GNNs which identifies unnecessary edges. Given a trained GNN model, we learn a simple classifier that, for every edge in every layer, predicts if that edge can be dropped. We demonstrate that such a classifier can be trained in a fully differentiable fashion, employing stochastic gates and encouraging sparsity through the expected $L_0$ norm. We use our technique as an attribution method to analyze GNN models for two tasks -- question answering and semantic role labeling -- providing insights into the information flow in these models. We show that we can drop a large proportion of edges without deteriorating the performance of the model, while we can analyse the remaining edges for interpreting model predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 194  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Interpretable and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Jian-Xin Li, Quan Wang, Yaming Yang, Jiangtao Cui, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has achieved extraordinary success in learning effective task-specific representations of nodes in graphs. However, regarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN methods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore all possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object, which hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to generate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN) to learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a hierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first, followed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically extract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within a length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce the computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and neighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed ie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its connection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time complexity. Extensive experiments on three real network datasets demonstrate the superiority of ie-HGCN over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Accurate Learning of Graph Representations with Graph Multiset Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Minki Kang, Jinheon Baek*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks have been widely used on modeling graph data, achieving impressive results on node classification and link prediction tasks. Yet, obtaining an accurate representation for a graph further requires a pooling function that maps a set of node representations into a compact form. A simple sum or average over all node representations considers all node features equally without consideration of their task relevance, and any structural dependencies among them. Recently proposed hierarchical graph pooling methods, on the other hand, may yield the same representation for two different graphs that are distinguished by the Weisfeiler-Lehman test, as they suboptimally preserve information from the node features. To tackle these limitations of existing graph pooling methods, we first formulate the graph pooling problem as a multiset encoding problem with auxiliary information about the graph structure, and propose a Graph Multiset Transformer (GMT) which is a multi-head attention based global pooling layer that captures the interaction between nodes according to their structural dependencies. We show that GMT satisfies both injectiveness and permutation invariance, such that it is at most as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Moreover, our methods can be easily extended to the previous node clustering approaches for hierarchical graph pooling. Our experimental results show that GMT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks with high memory and time efficiency, and obtains even larger performance gain on graph reconstruction and generation tasks.\n\n**Conference:** accurate-learning-of-graph-representations\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. Predicting Temporal Sets with Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks*\n\n*Hui Xiong, Weifeng Lv, Le Yu, Bowen Du, Leilei Sun, Chuanren Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Given a sequence of sets, where each set contains an arbitrary number of elements, the problem of temporal sets prediction aims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. In practice, temporal sets prediction is much more complex than predictive modelling of temporal events and time series, and is still an open problem. Many possible existing methods, if adapted for the problem of temporal sets prediction, usually follow a two-step strategy by first projecting temporal sets into latent representations and then learning a predictive model with the latent representations. The two-step approach often leads to information loss and unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution based on the deep neural networks for temporal sets prediction. A unique perspective of our approach is to learn element relationship by constructing set-level co-occurrence graph and then perform graph convolutions on the dynamic relationship graphs. Moreover, we design an attention-based module to adaptively learn the temporal dependency of elements and sets. Finally, we provide a gated updating mechanism to find the hidden shared patterns in different sequences and fuse both static and dynamic information to improve the prediction performance. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive performances even with a portion of the training data and can outperform existing methods with a significant margin.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Attention Coding for Training High-performance and Efficient Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Liang-Jian Deng, Zhaorui Wang, Yuhong Chou, Rui-Jie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences. However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision. Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a plug-and-play module that leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN architecture. GAC functions as a preprocessing layer that does not disrupt the spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by 3.10\\% on CIFAR100 with only 6-time steps and 1.07\\% on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to 66.9\\% of the previous works. To our best knowledge, it is the first time to explore the attention-based dynamic coding scheme in deep SNNs, with exceptional effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets.The Code is available at https://github.com/bollossom/GAC.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. Deeper Clinical Document Understanding Using Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: Scalable Graph Neural Networks for NLP*\n\n*David Talby, Veysel Kocaman, Hasham Ul Haq*\n\n**Abstract:** The surging amount of biomedical literature & digital clinical records presents a growing need for text mining techniques that can not only identify but also semantically relate entities in unstructured data. In this paper we propose a text mining framework comprising of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) models, which expands on previous work in three main ways. First, we introduce two new RE model architectures -- an accuracy-optimized one based on BioBERT and a speed-optimized one utilizing crafted features over a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN). Second, we evaluate both models on public benchmark datasets and obtain new state-of-the-art F1 scores on the 2012 i2b2 Clinical Temporal Relations challenge (F1 of 73.6, +1.2% over the previous SOTA), the 2010 i2b2 Clinical Relations challenge (F1 of 69.1, +1.2%), the 2019 Phenotype-Gene Relations dataset (F1 of 87.9, +8.5%), the 2012 Adverse Drug Events Drug-Reaction dataset (F1 of 90.0, +6.3%), and the 2018 n2c2 Posology Relations dataset (F1 of 96.7, +0.6%). Third, we show two practical applications of this framework -- for building a biomedical knowledge graph and for improving the accuracy of mapping entities to clinical codes. The system is built using the Spark NLP library which provides a production-grade, natively scalable, hardware-optimized, trainable & tunable NLP framework.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-25\n\n\n\n#### 6. Hierarchical Attention Models for Multi-Relational Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: Scalable Graph Neural Networks for NLP*\n\n*Yizhou Sun, Wei Wang, Roshni G. Iyer*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Bi-Level Attention-Based Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (BR-GCN), unique neural network architectures that utilize masked self-attentional layers with relational graph convolutions, to effectively operate on highly multi-relational data. BR-GCN models use bi-level attention to learn node embeddings through (1) node-level attention, and (2) relation-level attention. The node-level self-attentional layers use intra-relational graph interactions to learn relation-specific node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of neighborhood features in a sparse subgraph region. The relation-level self-attentional layers use inter-relational graph interactions to learn the final node embeddings using a weighted aggregation of relation-specific node embeddings. The BR-GCN bi-level attention mechanism extends Transformer-based multiplicative attention from the natural language processing (NLP) domain, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT)-based attention, to large-scale heterogeneous graphs (HGs). On node classification, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.29% to 14.95% as a stand-alone model, and on link prediction, BR-GCN outperforms baselines from 0.02% to 7.40% as an auto-encoder model. We also conduct ablation studies to evaluate the quality of BR-GCN's relation-level attention and discuss how its learning of graph structure may be transferred to enrich other graph neural networks (GNNs). Through various experiments, we show that BR-GCN's attention mechanism is both scalable and more effective in learning compared to state-of-the-art GNNs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that integrates hierarchical attention with graph neural networks, dynamic gating mechanisms, and ensures efficiency and scalability, here are the most relevant insights and information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN):**\n  - HANs are designed to capture the hierarchical structure of data, such as documents or sentences, using two levels of attention: word-level and sentence-level. This dual attention mechanism can be adapted for hierarchical graph structures, allowing the model to weigh the importance of nodes within clusters and clusters within the graph.\n\n## Efficient Graph Attention Networks\n\n- **Graphormer:**\n  - Graphormer adapts the Transformer architecture to model graph structures efficiently by incorporating structural encodings. This approach can be leveraged to design an efficient graph attention mechanism within the GAU, ensuring scalability to long sequences.\n\n- **Cluster-wise Graph Transformer (Cluster-GT):**\n  - Cluster-GT uses a Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism, which integrates techniques from Multiple Kernel Learning into a kernelized attention framework. This captures information at both node and cluster levels, effectively bridging the gap between cluster-level and node-level spaces. This concept can be applied to enhance the hierarchical attention in the GAU.\n\n## Dynamic Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Attention-Managed Gating:**\n  - Incorporating attention mechanisms to manage gating functions within neural networks can enhance the model's adaptability. This approach allows the model to focus on the most relevant hierarchical features dynamically, which can be integrated into the hierarchical normalization process of the GAU.\n\n## Scalability and Computational Efficiency\n\n- **Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN):**\n  - The h-GNN model uses a hybrid clustering method and successive stacking of compressed graphs to increase the network's depth. This approach preserves both local and global information within nodes and across the entire graph, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Similar techniques can be applied to the GAU to maintain computational feasibility.\n\n## Integration Strategy\n\n- **Combining Hierarchical Attention and Dynamic Gating:**\n  - Extend the HierarchicalRMSNorm to include attention-managed gating mechanisms at each scale. Implement an efficient graph attention mechanism inspired by Graphormer or Cluster-GT, adapted to the GAU context. This combination can capture hierarchical patterns and global dependencies dynamically and efficiently.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- **Global and Local Attention:**\n  - A hybrid approach combining global and local attention mechanisms can leverage the strengths of both, capturing long-range dependencies and detailed local features. This is particularly relevant for tasks requiring comprehensive context understanding.\n\n- **Contrastive Learning:**\n  - Using contrastive learning mechanisms, such as those in GAAEST, can enhance the representation learning by maximizing the mutual information between different levels of features. This can be applied to improve the robustness and accuracy of the GAU.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Practical Implementations:**\n  - Investigate publicly available implementations of Graphormer and related models to understand practical considerations and optimize the design.\n  - Explore how attention mechanisms can be used to manage gating functions effectively within neural networks.\n\n- **Advanced Training Techniques:**\n  - Research advanced training methods, such as curriculum learning or progressive training, to help in training complex models efficiently.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researcher can design a GAU that not only captures hierarchical patterns and global dependencies but also maintains efficiency, scalability, and adaptability.\n\n### Example Implementation Outline\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Layer, Dense, MultiHeadAttention\n\nclass HierarchicalGatedGraphAttention(Layer):\n    def __init__(self, units, num_heads):\n        super(HierarchicalGatedGraphAttention, self).__init__()\n        self.units = units\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.attention = MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=num_heads, key_dim=units)\n        self.gating_mechanism = Dense(units, activation='sigmoid')\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        # Compute attention scores\n        attention_scores = self.attention(inputs, inputs)\n        \n        # Apply dynamic gating mechanism\n        gating_weights = self.gating_mechanism(inputs)\n        gated_attention_scores = attention_scores * gating_weights\n        \n        # Compute context vector\n        context_vector = tf.reduce_sum(gated_attention_scores, axis=1)\n        \n        return context_vector\n\n# Example usage within a hierarchical structure\nclass HierarchicalRMSNormWithGating(Layer):\n    def __init__(self, num_scales, units, num_heads):\n        super(HierarchicalRMSNormWithGating, self).__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.units = units\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.hierarchical_attention_layers = [HierarchicalGatedGraphAttention(units, num_heads) for _ in range(num_scales)]\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        for i in range(self.num_scales):\n            inputs = self.hierarchical_attention_layers[i](inputs)\n        return inputs\n```\n\nThis outline demonstrates how hierarchical attention with dynamic gating can be integrated into a GAU, leveraging the strengths of both hierarchical normalization and efficient graph attention mechanisms.\n",

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Attention via Control Variates (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2023)\t**Cited by** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 52/52 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\n2021). ## E. 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS OF EFFICIENCY COMPARISON\n\nFor the simulation experiment conducted in $\\S 5.3$ we adopt the same transformer architecture across all attention variants.

Besides, in our ablation study, the efficiency metrics reported in Table 6 and Table 7 are evaluated under the same setup used during training. Remark on Modeling Short Sequences. Unfortunately, similar to most previous efficient attention baselines, EVA also runs slower than softmax attention under shorter sequences (e.g., length of 128 or 256), but it soon catches up in running speed, and the reduction of memory consumption is still significant. Besides, in short-sequence settings (such as the case of DeiT-Tiny/Small with sequences of 196 tokens), EVA often performs on par with or better than conventional softmax attention (see Table 1, whereas most previous attention variants usually perform much worse. This implies EVA can achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and quality: for short sequences, EVA is possible to achieve stronger performance competitive with softmax attention (despite in longer running time); while for long sequences, EVA can be run much faster with less memory. Comparison to Memory-efficient Attention Mechanisms. In this section, we conduct an empirical efficiency comparison between efficient approximate attention methods and FlashAttention, one of the memory-efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe \\& Staats, 2021, Dao et al., 2022) with optimized memory accesses. FlashAttention computes the exact softmax attention in an online manner without materializing the full attention matrix, achieving linear memory complexity with respect to sequence lengths; besides, both runtime and memory usage are further improved by minimizing IO accesses. We benchmark different attention modules on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, where we measure the memory usage and runtime of running a single attention block, consisting of 8 attention heads with 512 embedding dimension size, for both a forward and backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that FlashAttention achieves significant memory usage reduction for softmax attention approximation and even consumes much less memory than all considered approximate baselines under all sequence lengths. In terms of runtime, we notice that FlashAttention runs faster than most attention baselines under sequence lengths less than 2048 despite scaling quadratically, but EVA, along with other more efficient approximate variants, begin to catch up at longer sequence lengths. This implies that the quadratic computational costs of softmax attention still bottleneck its runtime performance, aligning with one of the main findings in Dao et al. (2022). According to this empirical study, we observe that FlashAttention offers a general and effective technique to speed up softmax attention; since many approximate variants (including EVA) exhibit a similar formulation to softmax attention (e.g., Equation 16), we expect they can also benefit from the optimized online softmax calculation technique and memory accesses of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). ## F EXPERIMENTS on Long RANGE ArEnA\n\nLong Range Arena (LRA; Tay et al. 2021) is a lightweight benchmark that assesses the ability of efficient attention methods to model long sequences in diverse domains. We follow the same hyper-parameter setup as Xiong et al. (2021b) to re-evaluate all attention baselines and report the\n\nTable 15: Classification accuracy (\\%) on LRA benchmark with different efficient attention mechanisms. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Avg. |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Softmax | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 6}$ | 64.91 | 80.70 | 40.61 | 68.29 | 58.63 |\n| Linformer | 38.21 | 53.91 | 77.66 | 39.40 | 66.44 | 55.12 |\n| Performer | 29.84 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 3 0}$ | 77.70 | 38.29 | 66.39 | 55.50 |\n| Reformer | 27.12 | 63.90 | 78.08 | 42.40 | 51.90 | 52.69 |\n| Scatterbrain | 38.21 | 64.04 | 77.83 | 42.51 | 60.62 | 56.64 |\n| Combiner | 38.26 | 63.98 | 81.47 | 42.80 | 55.94 | 56.49 |\n| LARA | 37.10 | 64.62 | 80.82 | 38.99 | 68.96 | 58.10 |\n| Nystr\u00f6mformer | 38.46 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 2 8}$ | 80.44 | 39.71 | 68.98 | 58.57 |\n| Local | 38.46 | 63.70 | 80.71 | 42.25 | 68.46 | 58.72 |\n| Long-short | 38.56 | 63.46 | $\\mathbf{8 1 . 7 3}$ | 40.54 | $\\mathbf{7 1 . 2 8}$ | 59.11 |\n| EVA | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 1}$ | 64.31 | 80.21 | $\\mathbf{4 3 . 2 4}$ | 70.90 | $\\mathbf{5 9 . 4 5}$ |\n\ncomparison in Table 15. We observe that EVA largely improves previous RFA methods such as Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), and performs competitively with full softmax attention. Notably, EVA even achieves better average results over all tasks, with higher accuracy on Image and Pathfinder benchmarks, suggesting its capability of capturing long-term dependencies. For LRA benchmark, we set all attention-specific hyper-parameters to 128 (e.g., the number of landmarks in Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al. 2021b) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), the window size in local attention and Combiner (Ren et al., 2021), etc.). We set $|E|=128$ and $C=64$ by default for EVA without any further tuning and find this setup works well. ## G Connections to Other AtTEntion Mechanisms\n\n## G. 1 RFA, SoftmAx AtTEntion, And EVA\n\nAs mentioned in our main text, one of the main contributions of this work is to develop a more general framework that bridges RFA and conventional softmax attention. To see how EVA (Equation 13) achieves this goal formally, note that if either $|E|=M$ or $C=M$, EVA would be equivalent to standard softmax attention; while if we set $|E|=0$ and $C=1$, EVA would recover vanilla RFA. ## G. 2 CONNECTIONS TO LARA\n\nNotably, EVA and LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) are two efficient attention mechanisms that are both built upon the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) formulation of RFAs. LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) puts the main focus on the proposal distribution used in SNIS and tries to design importance sampling proposals that are closer to the true underlying distribution. The proposed usage of multiple proposals further improves the estimation quality of SNIS and achieves strong empirical performance while still keeping linear complexity. In contrast to LARA, in this work we do not focus on the design choice of proposals used in importance sampling but aim to generalize the SNIS formulation further via control variates. As demonstrated in \\$3.2 our theory clearly delineates how the gap between such SNIS estimation and softmax attention can be closed by manipulating control variates. Since LARA and RFA are both SNIS estimators (their main difference lies in the choice of proposal distributions), our generalization also applies to LARA. To summarize, compared with LARA, EVA is a more general framework and improves conventional RFA from an orthogonal perspective. ## G. 3 Connections to Clustered AtTEntion\n\nClustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) is an efficient attention mechanism that first clusters the set of queries into multiple groups, computes the mean centroid of each group, and then performs attention between query centroids and original key-value pairs. This framework is fast and effective and enjoys well-bounded approximation error. Clustered attention and EVA share some similarities in two aspects. First, both of them adopt the partitioning technique to reduce the computational complexity while remaining effective; and secondly, both observe that the efficient attention mechanism can be improved by refining the approximation over specific elements. For instance, clustered attention can be improved (Vyas et al., 2020) by selecting top- $k$ key-value pairs that are most relevant to each centroid and then refining the approximation by recomputing attention weights over these keys using original queries; while EVA notices that we can directly employ the optimal control variate coefficient for a subset of key-value pairs $(m \\in E)$ while still remaining efficient, which yields a more accurate approximation. Nevertheless, our main technical contribution is to develop a control variate formulation in the context of RFA and demonstrate that how RFA can be further improved locally. On the other hand, while clustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) clusters queries, EVA partitions key-value pairs. This property makes EVA more amenable to the case of autoregressive language modeling since we do not impose clustering structures over the query set, and thus the causal relation among queries can be well maintained. ## G. 4 CONNECTIONS TO COMBINER\n\nCombiner (Ren et al. 2021) is a recently proposed attention mechanism that also partitions the sequence into chunks combined with local attention. The key difference between EVA and Combiner is the motivation, where Combiner introduces a structured factorization over the attention probability distribution, while our approach is built from the control variate perspective. ## G. 5 CONNECTIONS TO SCATTERbRAIN\n\nIn this section, we show that Scatterbrain (Chen et al., 2021a) can be cast as a special case of our framework EVA, although they are proposed based on quite different motivations. A Brief Review of Scatterbrain. Scatterbrain (Chen et al, 2021a) notes that sparse attention and RFA can approximate sharp and flat regions of the softmax attention matrix well, respectively. Based on this insight, Scatterbrain is proposed to first compute a Performer approximation to softmax attention and then cancel out the approximation error on critical regions via a sparse mechanism. Specifically, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) defines a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$ ) so that for each $(n, m) \\in \\mathbf{S}$ that indexes a non-zero entry. For notational simplicity, we also denote $\\operatorname{Supp}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{(i, j) \\mid S_{i j} \\neq 0\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{m \\mid S_{n m} \\neq 0\\right\\}$. With random features $\\phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ defined in Appendix A we let\n\n$$\nS_{n m}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then add it back to the approximate output:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{n}^{\\prime} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\mathbf{S V} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} S_{n m^{\\prime}} \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sparse mechanism can be thought of as modeling the error due to RFA and eliminating it on the support of $\\mathbf{S}$. After the correction step, Scatterbrain further adds a post-hoc normalization step to obtain a normalized attention output:\n\n$$\ny_{n}=\\frac{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}}{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) produces accurate approximation in the support of the sparse matrix and remains the random feature approximation outside the support. Scatterbrain is a Special Case of EVA. For notational convenience, we denote $E:=\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$. According to Proposition 1, suppose we employ optimal coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{m}$ for all entries in $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$, and use the same coefficient $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ for all the remaining entries (in other words, we let $C=1$ and the whole index set is only partitioned into two subsets $\\{E,[M] \\backslash E\\})$. Then we have\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5520e6e7b143a538a399g-35.jpg?height=138&width=1160&top_left_y=495&top_left_x=472)\n\nAnd the resulting estimator overall becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\sum_{m \\notin E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{m \\notin E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\left(1-\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nScatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) can be a special case of this estimation algorithm if we set the proposal distribution to $q(\\omega)=\\mathcal{N}(\\omega ;

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

The key objectives include:\n\n- **Efficient Hierarchical Attention**: Capture hierarchical patterns and dependencies in data.\n- **Dynamic Gating Mechanisms**: Enable adaptive control over information flow.\n- **Scalable Graph-Based Attention Networks**: Capture both local and global dependencies efficiently, especially in long sequences.\n- **Improved Performance**: Achieve lower perplexity, higher accuracy, robustness, and scalability.\n\n### Key Components and Useful Information\n\n#### Hierarchical Attention and Graph Neural Networks\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN)**:\n  - The concept of HAN, which uses word-level and sentence-level attention, can be adapted for processing inputs at multiple scales. This is similar to the hierarchical structure discussed in the context of graph neural networks, such as the hierarchical GNN (h-GNN) which uses successive hierarchies of graphs to increase network depth and preserve local and global information.\n\n- **Graphormer and Efficient Graph Attention**:\n  - Graphormer's approach to modeling graph structures using Transformers with structural encodings can be leveraged to design an efficient graph-based attention mechanism. This aligns with the idea of using node-to-cluster attention mechanisms, as seen in the Cluster-wise Graph Transformer, which captures information at both node and cluster levels without compressing each cluster into a single embedding.\n\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**:\n  - GATs assign different attention weights to neighbor nodes, which can be integrated into the GAU to capture relationships between tokens in a sequence effectively.\n\n#### Dynamic Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Attention-Managed Gating**:\n  - Incorporating attention-based gating mechanisms, as discussed in the context of RNNs, can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant information dynamically. This is similar to the gating mechanisms used in Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNNs), which extend GNNs by incorporating gates similar to those in GRUs.\n\n- **Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN)**:\n  - GGNNs provide a framework for better handling of sequential and structural data by combining gating mechanisms with GNNs. This can be adapted to the GAU design to enhance adaptability and scalability.\n\n#### Scalability and Computational Efficiency\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n  - Techniques such as sparse attention, low-rank approximations, or approximate nearest neighbor methods can help maintain computational efficiency. The use of efficient message-passing frameworks, like the one in Cluster-wise Graph Transformer, can achieve linear time complexity.\n\n- **Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)**:\n  - h-GNNs use hybrid clustering and successive stacking of compressed graphs to increase network depth while preserving local and global information. This approach can help the GAU remain scalable and efficient.\n\n### Integration Strategy and Expected Benefits\n\n- **Hierarchical Gated Graph Attention Unit**:\n  - The proposed GAU should extend HierarchicalRMSNorm with dynamic gating mechanisms managed by attention. It should also incorporate an efficient graph-based attention mechanism inspired by Graphormer or GAT. Ensuring computational efficiency through scalable attention methods and parameter-sharing techniques is crucial.\n\n- **Expected Benefits**:\n  - Enhanced ability to capture both local and global dependencies.\n  - Improved adaptability and robustness due to dynamic gating.\n  - Better generalization on downstream tasks through richer feature representations.\n  - Maintained computational efficiency and scalability for long sequences.\n\n### Relevant References and Concepts\n\n- **Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn)**: This mechanism from the Cluster-wise Graph Transformer integrates kernelized attention with multiple kernel learning, effectively capturing hierarchical graph structural information at both cluster and node levels.\n- **Hierarchical GNN (h-GNN)**: This model uses a hybrid clustering method and successive stacking of compressed graphs to increase network depth, preserving local and global information. This approach can be adapted for the GAU to ensure scalability and efficiency.\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: GATs assign different weights to neighbor nodes, which can be integrated into the GAU to enhance the capture of relationships between tokens in a sequence.\n- **Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN)**: GGNNs combine gating mechanisms with GNNs, facilitating better handling of sequential and structural data. This concept can be applied to the GAU to enhance adaptability and scalability.\n\nBy integrating these concepts and techniques, the researcher can design a GAU that is not only efficient and scalable but also highly effective in capturing complex hierarchical and graph-based dependencies, thereby achieving the desired performance improvements.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"integrated hierarchical normalization gating graph attention transformers\" \"combining multi-scale normalization with gated graph attention in transformers\" \"hierarchical gated graph attention in autoregressive language models\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, GCNs struggle to model\nwords with long-range dependencies or are not directly connected in the\ndependency tree. To address these challenges, we propose to utilize the\nself-attention mechanism where we explicitly fuse structural information to\nlearn the dependencies between words with different syntactic distances. We\nintroduce GATE, a {\\bf G}raph {\\bf A}ttention {\\bf T}ransformer {\\bf E}ncoder,\nand test its cross-lingual transferability on relation and event extraction\ntasks. We perform experiments on the ACE05 dataset that includes three\ntypologically different languages: English, Chinese, and Arabic. The evaluation\nresults show that GATE outperforms three recently proposed methods by a large\nmargin. Our detailed analysis reveals that due to the reliance on syntactic\ndependencies, GATE produces robust representations that facilitate transfer\nacross languages.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T20:30:35Z  (*Updated: 2021-02-17T20:11:41Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR\nparsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical\nattention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures\ninto the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative\nmodeling options.

This integration seeks to combine multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and efficient graph-based attention, thereby capturing both local and global dependencies in long sequences. The anticipated benefits include improved model performance, adaptability, scalability, and computational efficiency.\n\nFrom three rounds of search, the following key insights and related works have been identified:\n\n- **Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Normalization**: **HierarchicalRMSNorm** effectively captures multi-scale hierarchical features through adaptive normalization at different scales. This concept is supported by works like **Fast Multipole Attention** and **SPADE**, which address long sequence modeling by augmenting Transformer architectures with state space models and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms and Graph-Based Attention**: **GatedTTTLinear** introduces dynamic gating and graph-based convolutions to manage information flow and capture global dependencies. Related works such as **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** and **Recurrent Attention Networks** have demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating gating mechanisms with graph structures to enhance dependency modeling in neural networks.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Studies like **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** and **Fast Multipole Attention** highlight methods to reduce computational and memory overheads in Transformer models. These advancements are crucial for maintaining efficiency and scalability, especially when handling long sequences, aligning with HG-GAT's objectives.\n\n- **Dynamic Context Pruning and Recurrent Attention**: Techniques like **Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers** and **Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling** present strategies to manage long sequences by dynamically pruning context or recurrently modeling dependencies, offering complementary insights for HG-GAT.\n\n- **Algorithmic and Architectural Innovations**: Models such as **Megalodon** and **FNetAR** provide alternative approaches to optimizing Transformer architectures by introducing components like time-step normalization and replacing self-attention with Fourier transforms, which may inform HG-GAT's optimization strategies.\n\n- **Position Coupling and Transformer Generalization**: **Position Coupling** explores the role of positional encodings in Transformer models and their impact on generalization to longer sequences. This is relevant to HG-GAT's normalization and attention mechanisms, ensuring that the model can generalize effectively without relying solely on fixed positional information.\n\nOverall, the integration of hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating and graph-based attention appears to be a novel approach that synergistically combines existing strengths to address the challenges of long sequence modeling in language models.\n\n#### 2. **Useful References with Excerpts**\n\n- **Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (SPADE)**\n  \n  - *Zuo, S., Liu, X., Jiao, J., Xavier Charles, D., Manavoglu, E., Zhao, T., Gao, J.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical RMSNorm Transformer\" \"Gated Graph Attention Networks\" \"Multi-scale normalization in language models\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep\nneural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because\nof its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and\nweight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm\nmakes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying\nnetwork, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nre-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean\nsquare layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs\nto a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model\nre-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability.\nRMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We\nalso present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of\nthe summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments\non several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves\ncomparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64%\non different models.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical RMSNorm Transformer\" \"Gated Graph Attention Networks\" \"Multi-scale normalization in language models\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Re-Introducing LayerNorm: Geometric Meaning, Irreversibility and a\n  Comparative Study with RMSNorm\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical RMSNorm Transformer\" \"Gated Graph Attention Networks\" \"Multi-scale normalization in language models\"*\n\n*Akshat Gupta, Atahan Ozdemir, Gopala Anumanchipalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a pivotal step in the transformer architecture. This\npaper delves into the less explored geometric implications of this process,\nexamining how LayerNorm influences the norm and orientation of hidden vectors\nin the representation space. We show that the definition of LayerNorm is\ninnately linked to the uniform vector, defined as $\\boldsymbol{1} = [1, 1, 1,\n1, \\cdots, 1]^T \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$. We then show that the standardization step\nin LayerNorm can be understood in three simple steps: (i) remove the component\nof a vector along the uniform vector, (ii) normalize the remaining vector, and\n(iii) scale the resultant vector by $\\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimensionality\nof the representation space. We also introduce the property of\n\"irreversibility\" for LayerNorm, where we show that the information lost during\nthe normalization process cannot be recovered. In other words, unlike batch\nnormalization, LayerNorm cannot learn an identity transform. While we present\npossible arguments for removing the component along the uniform vector, the\nchoice of removing this component seems arbitrary and not well motivated by the\noriginal authors. To evaluate the usefulness of this step, we compare the\nhidden representations of LayerNorm-based LLMs with models trained using\nRMSNorm and show that all LLMs naturally align representations orthogonal to\nthe uniform vector, presenting the first mechanistic evidence that removing the\ncomponent along the uniform vector in LayerNorm is a redundant step. Our\nfindings support the use of RMSNorm over LayerNorm as it is not only more\ncomputationally efficient with comparable downstream performance, but also\nlearns a similar distribution of hidden representations that operate orthogonal\nto the uniform vector.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-19T17:58:07Z*)\n\n\n\n\n",

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Fast Multipole Attention: A Divide-and-Conquer Attention Mechanism for\n  Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical normalization in transformers\" \"gated attention mechanisms in language models\" \"graph-based attention in autoregressive transformers\"*\n\n*Yanming Kang, Giang Tran, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many\nareas. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the\ninput length hinders the applicability of Transformer-based models to long\nsequences. To address this, we present Fast Multipole Attention, a new\nattention mechanism that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the time\nand memory complexity of attention for sequences of length $n$ from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ or $O(n)$, while retaining a\nglobal receptive field. The hierarchical approach groups queries, keys, and\nvalues into $\\mathcal{O}( \\log n)$ levels of resolution, where groups at\ngreater distances are increasingly larger in size and the weights to compute\ngroup quantities are learned. As such, the interaction between tokens far from\neach other is considered in lower resolution in an efficient hierarchical\nmanner. The overall complexity of Fast Multipole Attention is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$\nor $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$, depending on whether the queries are down-sampled\nor not. This multi-level divide-and-conquer strategy is inspired by fast\nsummation methods from $n$-body physics and the Fast Multipole Method. We\nperform evaluation on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling tasks\nand compare our Fast Multipole Attention model with other efficient attention\nvariants on medium-size datasets. We find empirically that the Fast Multipole\nTransformer performs much better than other efficient transformers in terms of\nmemory size and accuracy. The Fast Multipole Attention mechanism has the\npotential to empower large language models with much greater sequence lengths,\ntaking the full context into account in an efficient, naturally hierarchical\nmanner during training and when generating long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18T13:40:41Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-30T15:02:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We focus on two aspects. First, we revisit Transformer\nmodel configurations specifically for language modeling. We show that well\nconfigured Transformer models outperform our baseline models based on the\nshallow stack of LSTM recurrent neural network layers. We carry out experiments\non the open-source LibriSpeech 960hr task, for both 200K vocabulary word-level\nand 10K byte-pair encoding subword-level language modeling. We apply our\nword-level models to conventional hybrid speech recognition by lattice\nrescoring, and the subword-level models to attention based encoder-decoder\nmodels by shallow fusion. Second, we show that deep Transformer language models\ndo not require positional encoding. The positional encoding is an essential\naugmentation for the self-attention mechanism which is invariant to sequence\nordering. However, in autoregressive setup, as is the case for language\nmodeling, the amount of information increases along the position dimension,\nwhich is a positional signal by its own. The analysis of attention weights\nshows that deep autoregressive self-attention models can automatically make use\nof such positional information. We find that removing the positional encoding\neven slightly improves the performance of these models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-10T15:50:00Z  (*Updated: 2019-07-11T15:45:32Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To support the researcher's goal of developing a novel autoregressive language model block, the Hierarchical Gated Graph Attention Transformer (HG-GAT), here are some targeted search strategies and potential sources of information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### External Source Searches\n\n#### 1. **Hierarchical Normalization in Transformers**\n- Search for recent papers and preprints that discuss the integration of hierarchical normalization techniques within transformer architectures.

The core objective is to combine multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and efficient graph-based attention, thereby capturing both local and global dependencies in long sequences. This integration aims to improve model performance, adaptability, scalability, and computational efficiency.\n\nFrom the internal and external search results, several related works have explored components similar to those proposed in HG-GAT. Notably:\n\n- **RMSNorm** and its variants focus on efficient normalization techniques, offering computational advantages over traditional LayerNorm.\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GATs)** and their extensions have been instrumental in capturing relational dependencies within data structured as graphs.\n- **Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Approaches** have been investigated to capture features at different granularities, enhancing model robustness and generalization.\n\nHowever, the specific **integration of hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating and graph-based attention** within transformer architectures for autoregressive language modeling appears to be a novel approach, as existing literature primarily addresses these components in isolation or within different contexts.\n\n#### 2. **Useful References with Excerpts**\n\n- **Zhang, B., & Sennrich, R.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This dynamic adaptability is crucial for handling varying input complexities and long sequences.\n  - **Integration Potential**: Combining these two can theoretically provide a robust framework where hierarchical normalization ensures multi-scale feature extraction while gated mechanisms dynamically control information flow and global dependencies are efficiently modeled through graph-based attention.\n\n- **Novelty Verification**:\n  - Reviewed existing literature and internal sources reveal that while hierarchical normalization, gating mechanisms, and graph-based attention mechanisms have been individually explored, their **specific integration within an autoregressive transformer architecture** for language modeling has not been extensively studied.\n  - Notable exception includes the **Fast Multipole Attention** which introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism inspired by the Fast Multipole Method, but without the dynamic gating and hierarchical normalization facets proposed in HG-GAT.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency and Scalability**:\n  - Introducing hierarchical and graph-based mechanisms can potentially increase computational complexity. However, papers like **Fast Multipole Attention** and **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** demonstrate approaches to maintain or even improve efficiency through divide-and-conquer strategies and operational restructuring.\n  - **Optimization Techniques**: Leveraging sparse attention patterns, multi-level grouping, and efficient matrix operations can mitigate the additional computational overhead introduced by graph-based attention and hierarchical normalization.\n\n- **Handling Long Sequences**:\n  - Sequencing tasks in language models often require handling very long contexts, where traditional self-attention becomes computationally prohibitive. Strategies like **Dynamic Context Pruning** and **Recurrent Attention Networks** offer frameworks to manage long sequences efficiently, which aligns with HG-GAT\u2019s goals.\n  - **Hierarchical Schemes**: By processing information at multiple scales, the model can effectively handle long dependencies without a linear increase in computational cost.\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations**:\n  - The integrated approach of HG-GAT builds on established normalization and attention mechanisms, ensuring that the theoretical underpinnings are robust.\n  - **Convergence and Stability**: Ensuring that the combined hierarchical normalization and gated graph attention mechanisms do not lead to training instability or degraded performance is crucial. Existing works emphasize the importance of controlled normalization and attention practices to maintain model stability.\n\n- **Alignment with Research Trends**:\n  - The proposal aligns with contemporary research focusing on optimizing transformer architectures for efficiency and scalability. It addresses the critical need for models that can handle long sequences with reduced computational resources.\n  - The emphasis on combining multiple advanced mechanisms (hierarchical normalization, dynamic gating, graph-based attention) reflects a trend towards more sophisticated and specialized model architectures in language modeling.\n\n- **Potential Challenges**:\n  - **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating multiple advanced mechanisms requires meticulous architectural design to ensure seamless interactions between components.\n  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Balancing the influence of hierarchical scales, gating mechanisms, and graph-based attention may introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning.\n  - **Empirical Validation**: Rigorous experiments are necessary to demonstrate the practical benefits of the integrated approach, particularly in terms of performance improvements and computational savings.\n\n#### 4. **Future Search Plan**\n\nTo further refine the understanding and assessment of the **HG-GAT** proposal, the following search strategies are recommended for subsequent rounds:\n\n1. **Explore Integrated Approaches in Literature**:\n   -

This integration aims to create a GAU that can adaptively control information flow at multiple scales and effectively capture global dependencies without significant computational cost, thereby improving perplexity, accuracy, robustness, and scalability in language models.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **HierarchicalRMSNorm**:\n  - **Zhang & Sennrich (2019)** proposed RMSNorm to normalize inputs via root mean square, simplifying LayerNorm and improving computational efficiency. HierarchicalRMSNorm extends this by incorporating multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature relationships.\n  \n- **GatedTTTLinear**:\n  - Augments TTTLinear GAUs with gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutions. Introduces learnable gates and graph convolutions to model relational dependencies, enhancing adaptability and the ability to capture both local and global dependencies.\n\n- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**:\n  - **Veli\u010dkovi\u0107 et al.

Decompose input \\( X \\) into multiple scales using causal downsampling.\n   - For each scale \\( s \\):\n     - Compute RMS normalization.\n     - Apply gating mechanism using a sigmoid activation.\n     - Perform causal upsampling to match the original sequence length.\n   - Integrate the outputs from all scales using learned weights normalized with softmax.\n\n3. **Graph Attention Mechanism**:\n   - Project the normalized output \\( Y \\) to queries \\( Q \\), keys \\( K \\), and values \\( V \\).\n   - Compute attention scores and apply softmax to obtain attention probabilities.\n   - Apply dropout if necessary.\n   - Compute the attention output and project back to the embedding dimension.\n\n4. **Forward Pass**:\n   - In the HG_GAU module, pass the input \\( X \\) through the hierarchical gated normalization.\n   - Pass the normalized output through the graph attention layer.\n   - The final output \\( Y \\) captures both local hierarchical patterns and global dependencies.\n\n### Mathematical Formulas\n\n- **Gating Mechanism**:\n  \\[\n  G_s = \\sigma(X_s W_g^s + b_g^s)\n  \\]\n- **RMS Normalization**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{rms}_s(X) = \\sqrt{\\text{mean}(X_s^2, \\text{dim}=-1, \\text{keepdim=True}) + \\epsilon}\n  \\]\n- **Scale Integration**:\n  \\[\n  Y = \\sum_{s \\in S} w_s \\tilde{Y}_s\n  \\]\n- **Attention Scores**:\n  \\[\n  \\text{scores} = \\frac{Q K^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\n  \\]\n- **Attention Output**:\n  \\[\n  Z = \\text{softmax}(\\text{scores}) V\n  \\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe **Hierarchical Gated Graph Attention Transformer (HG-GAT)** effectively combines the strengths of HierarchicalRMSNorm and GatedTTTLinear while addressing their limitations. By integrating hierarchical multi-scale normalization with dynamic gating mechanisms and efficient graph-based attention, HG-GAT captures both local hierarchical patterns and global dependencies. The design ensures computational efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for long sequences. This approach is expected to improve model performance in terms of perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and scalability.\n\n## References\n\n1.
