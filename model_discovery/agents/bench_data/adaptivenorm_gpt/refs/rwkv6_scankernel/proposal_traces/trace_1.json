FLuRKA: Fast and accurate unified Low-Rank&Kernel Attention (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Ahan Gupta, Hao Guo, Yueming Yuan, Yan-Quan Zhou, Charith Mendis*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work theoretically and empirically evaluates the speed and quality of FLuRKA, a new class of transformers that achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n**Abstract:** Many efficient $\\textit{approximate}$ self-attention techniques have become prevalent since the inception of the transformer architecture. Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/83 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nThe resultant size of $A_{i}$ is $O\\left(N d_{k}\\right)$, where $d_{k}$ is the downsampling-factor: a hyperparameter that is set prior to training. In practice, $d_{k}$ is agnostic of $N$ and is much smaller, linearizing self-attention. Kernel Methods Kernel methods |Choromanski et al., 2021, Zheng et al., 2022, 2023, Katharopoulos et al. 2020] replace the softmax with a cheaper approximation. They map the input to a space where the dot-product approximates the softmax, computing the following for $\\mathrm{Head}_{i}$ :\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(Q W_{i}^{Q}\\right)\\left(\\phi\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T} V W_{i}^{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nWhere $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{p}}$ is a kernel with the property: $\\operatorname{softmax}(x, y) \\approx \\phi(x)^{T} \\cdot \\phi(y)$. Kernel methods do not materialize the matrix $A_{i}$ directly, instead by multiplying out the matrices in an optimal manner, they linearize self-attention to $O\\left(N d_{p}^{2}\\right)$. There are two categories of kernel methods: random feature and non-random-feature-mapped kernels. Random feature mapped kernels are parameterised by $m$ i.i.d random-variables $\\psi_{1}, \\psi_{2}, \\ldots \\psi_{m}$ with $\\psi_{i}: \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, where $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\psi_{i}(x)^{T} \\cdot \\psi_{i}(y)\\right]=\\exp \\left(x^{T} \\cdot y\\right)$, and are defined as: $\\phi(x)=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left[\\psi_{1}(x), \\psi_{2}(x), \\ldots \\psi_{m}(x)\\right]$. Non-random feature mapped kernels have no element of randomness and instead use kernels like the exponential linear unit Katharopoulos et al., 2020]. We fuse low-rank methods with both random (performer, EVA) and non-random (RNN) feature mapped kernel methods. ### 2.2 Unified Attention Mechanisms\n\nExisting unified attention methods exploit the synergies between disparate attention mechanisms for higher model quality. Scatterbrain [Chen et al., 2021a] unifies sparse with kernel methods whereas longshot Zhu et al. [2021] unifies sparse with low-rank methods. However, both these existing fusions have model speeds lower-bounded by the faster of their respective constituents, limiting their training-efficiencies. Although we also propose a unification of different transformers, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to explore a unification: (1) of low-rank and kernel methods, (2) that produces high quality transformers with faster model speeds than both constituent models. ## 3 FLuRKA: Fused Low-Rank and Kernel Attention\n\nConstructing unified high-quality transformers whose model speeds are faster than their constituents is challenging due to two reasons.

To design training-efficient models across diverse tasks, researchers have experimented with unifying different linear time self-attention approximation techniques to combine their individual strengths. Scatterbrain (SB) Chen et al. [2021a] unifies kernel (K) and sparse (S) methods by computing an attention matrix whose values come from $S$ if the cosine similarity between a query and key is large, else comes from K. Though expressive, SB requires K and S to be entirely computed, resulting in $T(S B)>\\min (T(K), T(S))$ due to parallelism, where $T$ is the step-time (model speed) of a corresponding method. Long-short (LS) Zhu et al. [2021] unifies low-rank (LR) and sparse ( S ) methods by computing low-rank approximation and concatenating the attention matrix with a sparse local window of keys and values for each query. Though expressive, LS also requires the entire computation of LR and S to be computed, similarly resulting in $T(L S)>\\min (T(L R), T(S))$. Existing fusions are limited in their training-efficiencies due to model speeds lower-bounded by the faster of their constituent methods. Constructing a unification faster than both constituent models requires an additional approximation that partially computes at least one of them. However, naively doing so may reduce model expressivity and adversely impact quality. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a unification of low-rank (LR) and kernel (K) methods, FLuRKA (Fast and accurate Low-rank and Kernel Attention), a new class of high-quality unified transformers that is faster than its constituent models. We specifically construct a unification that exploits the orthogonal compute strengths of low-rank methods (efficient linear transformations) and kernel methods (efficient softmax kernel computations), resulting in model speeds faster than $\\min (T(L R), T(K))$. Additionally, we demonstrate our construction tightly approximates full attention and is of high-quality. Empirically, we validate FLuRKA and show they are up to 3.3 x and 1.7 x faster than constituent low-rank and kernel approximations with comparable model qualities across 6 diverse data-sets spanning image and text modalities. FLuRKA variants are highly training-efficient, requiring fewer FLOPs than full attention to achieve similar loss levels (see table 1). This significantly reduces the computational cost of training high-quality models for a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we make the following contributions:\n\n- A technique to unify two classes of approximations: low-rank and kernel methods, to produce a new class of transformers, FLuRKA. FLuRKA are faster than constituent low-rank and kernel methods, incurring step-times (model speeds) faster than $\\min (T(L R), T(K))$ and are of high quality, resulting in high training-efficiencies. - A theoretical analysis of FLuRKA where we delineate precisely when FLuRKA are faster than low-rank and kernel methods and additionally show that FLuRKA have tight approximation error with respect to full-attention. - Empirical studies on three different instantiations of low-rank and kernel methods demonstrating the generality of our technique. Our studies show that FLuRKA are up to 1.7x and 3.3 x faster compared to kernel and low-rank methods, respectively.\n```\n\n#### 2. Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/35 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/48 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\neither writing C++ CUDA kernels (Child et al., 2019) or using TVMs (Beltagy et al. 2020)). Other techniques which aim to reduce Transformers' space complexity include reversible residual layers allowing one-time activation storage in training (Kitaev et al., 2020) and shared attention weights (Xiao et al., 2019). These constraints may impede application to long-sequence problems, where approximations of the attention mechanism are not sufficient. Approximations based on truncated back-propagation (Dai et al., 2019) are also unable to capture long-distance correlations since the gradients are only propagated inside a localized window. Other methods propose biased estimation of regular attention but only in the non-causal setting and with large mean squared error (Wang et al., 2020). In response, we introduce the first Transformer architectures, Performers, capable of provably accurate and practical estimation of regular (softmax) full-rank attention, but of only linear space and time complexity and not relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. Performers use the Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR+) mechanism, leveraging new methods for approximating softmax and Gaussian kernels, which we propose. We believe these methods are of independent interest, contributing to the theory of scalable kernel methods. Consequently, Performers are the first linear architectures fully compatible (via small amounts of fine-tuning) with regular Transformers, providing strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and lower variance of the approximation. FAVOR+ can be also applied to efficiently model other kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, that are beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and find for them optimal attention-kernels. FAVOR+ can also be applied beyond the Transformer scope as a more scalable replacement for regular attention, which itself has a wide variety of uses in computer vision (Fu et al. 2019), reinforcement learning (Zambaldi et al., 2019), training with softmax cross entropy loss, and even combinatorial optimization (Vinyals et al., 2015). We test Performers on a rich set of tasks ranging from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers. We emphasize that in principle, FAVOR + can also be combined with other techniques, such as reversible layers (Kitaev et al., 2020) or cluster-based attention (Roy et al., 2020). ## 2 FAVOR + MEChanism \\& Positive Orthogonal Random Features\n\nBelow we describe in detail the FAVOR+ mechanism - the backbone of the Performer's architecture. We introduce a new method for estimating softmax (and Gaussian) kernels with positive orthogonal random features which FAVOR+ leverages for the robust and unbiased estimation of regular (softmax) attention and show how FAVOR+ can be applied for other attention-kernels. ### 2.1 PRELIMINARIES - REGULAR ATTENTION MECHANISM\n\nLet $L$ be the size of an input sequence of tokens. Then regular dot-product attention (Vaswani et al. 2017) is a mapping which accepts matrices $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ as input where $d$ is the hidden dimension (dimension of the latent representation). Matrices $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ are intermediate representations of the input and their rows can be interpreted as queries, keys and values of the continuous dictionary data structure respectively. Bidirectional (or non-directional (Devlin et al., 2018)) dot-product attention has the following form, where $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ is the so-called attention matrix:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Att}_{\\leftrightarrow}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\mathbf{D}^{-1} \\mathbf{A V}, \\quad \\mathbf{A}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right), \\quad \\mathbf{D}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\mathbf{A 1}_{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $\\exp (\\cdot)$ is applied elementwise, $\\mathbf{1}_{L}$ is the all-ones vector of length $L$, and $\\operatorname{diag}(\\cdot)$ is a diagonal matrix with the input vector as the diagonal. Time and space complexity of computing (1) are $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ and $O\\left(L^{2}+L d\\right)$ respectively, because $\\mathbf{A}$ has to be stored explicitly. Hence, in principle, dot-product attention of type (1) is incompatible with end-to-end processing of long sequences. Bidirectional attention is applied in encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention in Seq2Seq architectures. Another important type of attention is unidirectional dot-product attention which has the form:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Att}_{\\rightarrow}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{D}}^{-1} \\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{V}, \\quad \\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}}=\\operatorname{tril}(\\mathbf{A}), \\quad \\widetilde{\\mathbf{D}}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{1}_{L}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{tril}(\\cdot)$ returns the lower-triangular part of the argument matrix including the diagonal. As discussed in (Vaswani et al., 2017), unidirectional attention is used for autoregressive generative modelling, e.g. as self-attention in generative Transformers as well as the decoder part of Seq2Seq Transformers. We will show that attention matrix A can be approximated up to any precision in time $O\\left(L d^{2} \\log (d)\\right)$. For comparison, popular methods leveraging sparsity via Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques (Kitaev et al. 2020) have $O\\left(L d^{2} \\log L\\right)$ time complexity. In the main body of the paper we will describe FAVOR + for bidirectional attention. Completely analogous results can be obtained for the unidirectional variant via the mechanism of prefix-sums (all details in the Appendix B.1). ### 2.2 Generalized KerneliZable Attention\n\nFAVOR+ works for attention blocks using matrices $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ of the form $\\mathbf{A}(i, j)=\\mathrm{K}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}^{\\top}\\right)$, with $\\mathbf{q}_{i} / \\mathbf{k}_{j}$ standing for the $i^{t h} / j^{t h}$ query/key row-vector in $\\mathbf{Q} / \\mathbf{K}$ and kernel $\\mathrm{K}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ defined for the (usually randomized) mapping: $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}^{r}$ (for some $r>0$ ) as:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{K}(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y})=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{x})^{\\top} \\phi(\\mathbf{y})\\right]\n$$\n\nWe call $\\phi(\\mathbf{u})$ a random feature map for $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. For $\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime}, \\mathbf{K}^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times r}$ with rows given as $\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)^{\\top}$ and $\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)^{\\top}$ respectively, Equation 3 leads directly to the efficient attention mechanism of the form:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{\\operatorname{Att}_{\\leftrightarrow}}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\widehat{\\mathbf{D}}^{-1}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right), \\quad \\widehat{\\mathbf{D}}=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}^{\\prime}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\prime}\\right)^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Att}_{\\leftrightarrow}}$ stands for the approximate attention and brackets indicate the order of computations. It is easy to see that such a mechanism is characterized by space complexity $O(L r+L d+r d)$ and time complexity $O(L r d)$ as opposed to $O\\left(L^{2}+L d\\right)$ and $O\\left(L^{2} d\\right)$ of the regular attention (see also Fig. 11. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4924042e5986b33a3d3bg-03.jpg?height=440&width=1391&top_left_y=1271&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 1: Approximation of the regular attention mechanism AV (before $\\mathbf{D}^{-1}$-renormalization) via (random) feature maps. Dashed-blocks indicate order of computation with corresponding time complexities attached. The above scheme constitutes the FA-part of the FAVOR+ mechanism. The remaining OR+ part answers the following questions: (1) How expressive is the attention model defined in Equation 3 and in particular, can we use it in principle to approximate regular softmax attention ? (2) How do we implement it robustly in practice, and in particular, can we choose $r \\ll L$ for $L \\gg d$ to obtain desired space and time complexity gains? We answer these questions in the next sections. ### 2.3 HOW TO AND HOW NOT TO APPROXIMATE SOFTMAX-KERNELS FOR ATTENTION\n\nIt turns out that by taking $\\phi$ of the following form for functions $f_{1}, \\ldots, f_{l}: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, function $g: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ and deterministic vectors $\\omega_{i}$ or $\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{m} \\stackrel{\\text { iid }}{\\sim} \\mathcal{D}$ for some distribution $\\mathcal{D} \\in \\mathcal{P}\\left(\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\right)$ :\n\n$$\n\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{h(\\mathbf{x})}{\\sqrt{m}}\\left(f_{1}\\left(\\omega_{1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}\\right), \\ldots, f_{1}\\left(\\omega_{m}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}\\right), \\ldots, f_{l}\\left(\\omega_{1}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}\\right), \\ldots, f_{l}\\left(\\omega_{m}^{\\top} \\mathbf{x}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwe can model most kernels used in practice.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient kernel approximation, fast kernel computation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new kernel approximation algorithm - Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix and shows that the resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low- rank kernel approximation methods in terms of speed, approximation error, and memory usage.\n\n**Abstract:** The scalability of kernel machines is a big challenge when facing millions of samples due to storage and computation issues for large kernel matrices, that are usually dense. Recently, many papers have suggested tackling this problem by using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. In this paper, we first make the observation that the structure of shift-invariant kernels changes from low-rank to block-diagonal (without any low-rank structure) when varying the scale parameter. Based on this observation, we propose a new kernel approximation algorithm - Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix.

Efficient Dataset Distillation Using Random Feature Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient kernel approximation*\n\n*Noel Loo, Ramin M. Hasani, Alexander Amini, Daniela Rus*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel algorithm that uses a random feature approximation (RFA) of the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, which reduces the kernel matrix computation to $O(|S|)$.\n\n**Abstract:** Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into smaller synthetic coresets which retain performance with the aim of reducing the storage and computational burden of processing the entire dataset. Today's best-performing algorithm, \\textit{Kernel Inducing Points} (KIP), which makes use of the correspondence between infinite-width neural networks and kernel-ridge regression, is prohibitively slow due to the exact computation of the neural tangent kernel matrix, scaling $O(|S|^2)$, with $|S|$ being the coreset size. To improve this, we propose a novel algorithm that uses a random feature approximation (RFA) of the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, which reduces the kernel matrix computation to $O(|S|)$. Our algorithm provides at least a 100-fold speedup over KIP and can run on a single GPU. Our new method, termed an RFA Distillation (RFAD), performs competitively with KIP and other dataset condensation algorithms in accuracy over a range of large-scale datasets, both in kernel regression and finite-width network training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on tasks involving model interpretability and privacy preservation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 75  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4.

In the in\ufb01nite width limit, the NTK can sometimes be computed analytically and is useful for understanding training and generalization of NN architectures. At \ufb01nite widths, the NTK is also used to better initialize NNs, compare the conditioning across models, perform architecture search, and do meta-learning. Unfortunately, the \ufb01nite width NTK is notoriously expensive to compute, which severely limits its practical utility. We perform the \ufb01rst in-depth analysis of the compute and memory requirements for NTK computation in \ufb01nite width networks. Leveraging the structure of neural networks, we further propose two novel algorithms that change the ex-ponent of the compute and memory requirements of the \ufb01nite width NTK, dramatically improving ef\ufb01ciency.

A Fast, Well-Founded Approximation to the Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel\n\n*From Search Query: fast kernel computation*\n\n*Mohamad Amin Mohamadi, Danica J. Sutherland*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that one such approximation, which is called \"sum of logits\", converges to the true eNTK at initialization for any network with a wide final\"readout\"layer.\n\n**Abstract:** Empirical neural tangent kernels (eNTKs) can provide a good understanding of a given network's representation: they are often far less expensive to compute and applicable more broadly than infinite width NTKs. For networks with O output units (e.g. an O-class classifier), however, the eNTK on N inputs is of size $NO \\times NO$, taking $O((NO)^2)$ memory and up to $O((NO)^3)$ computation. Most existing applications have therefore used one of a handful of approximations yielding $N \\times N$ kernel matrices, saving orders of magnitude of computation, but with limited to no justification. We prove that one such approximation, which we call\"sum of logits\", converges to the true eNTK at initialization for any network with a wide final\"readout\"layer. Our experiments demonstrate the quality of this approximation for various uses across a range of settings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Fast Neural Kernel Embeddings for General Activations\n\n*From Search Query: fast kernel computation*\n\n*Insu Han, A. Zandieh, Jaehoon Lee, Roman Novak, Lechao Xiao, Amin Karbasi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A fast sketching method is proposed that approximates any multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation functions, going beyond the commonly analyzed ReLU activation.\n\n**Abstract:** Infinite width limit has shed light on generalization and optimization aspects of deep learning by establishing connections between neural networks and kernel methods. Despite their importance, the utility of these kernel methods was limited in large-scale learning settings due to their (super-)quadratic runtime and memory complexities. Moreover, most prior works on neural kernels have focused on the ReLU activation, mainly due to its popularity but also due to the difficulty of computing such kernels for general activations. In this work, we overcome such difficulties by providing methods to work with general activations. First, we compile and expand the list of activation functions admitting exact dual activation expressions to compute neural kernels. When the exact computation is unknown, we present methods to effectively approximate them. We propose a fast sketching method that approximates any multi-layered Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrices for a wide range of activation functions, going beyond the commonly analyzed ReLU activation. This is done by showing how to approximate the neural kernels using the truncated Hermite expansion of any desired activation functions. While most prior works require data points on the unit sphere, our methods do not suffer from such limitations and are applicable to any dataset of points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Furthermore, we provide a subspace embedding for NNGP and NTK matrices with near input-sparsity runtime and near-optimal target dimension which applies to any \\emph{homogeneous} dual activation functions with rapidly convergent Taylor expansion. Empirically, with respect to exact convolutional NTK (CNTK) computation, our method achieves $106\\times$ speedup for approximate CNTK of a 5-layer Myrtle network on CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Increasing the efficiency of Sequential Monte Carlo samplers through the use of approximately optimal L-kernels\n\n*From Search Query: efficient kernel approximation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** By facilitating the generation of samples from arbitrary probability\ndistributions, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is, arguably, \\emph{the} tool\nfor the evaluation of Bayesian inference problems that yield non-standard\nposterior distributions. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that\nSequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers have the potential to outperform MCMC in\na number of ways. SMC samplers are better suited to highly parallel computing\narchitectures and also feature various tuning parameters that are not available\nto MCMC. One such parameter - the `L-kernel' - is a user-defined probability\ndistribution that can be used to influence the efficiency of the sampler. In\nthe current paper, the authors explain how to derive an expression for the\nL-kernel that minimises the variance of the estimates realised by an SMC\nsampler. Various approximation methods are then proposed to aid implementation\nof the proposed L-kernel. The improved performance of the resulting algorithm\nis demonstrated in multiple scenarios. For the examples shown in the current\npaper, the use of an approximately optimum L-kernel has reduced the variance of\nthe SMC estimates by up to 99 % while also reducing the number of times that\nresampling was required by between 65 % and 70 %.

Efficient Approximation Algorithms for Strings Kernel Based Sequence Classification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient kernel approximation*\n\n*Imdad Ullah Khan, Muhammad Farhan, Juvaria Tariq, Mudassir Shabbir, Arif Zaman*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence classification algorithms, such as SVM, require a definition of distance (similarity) measure between two sequences. A commonly used notion of similarity is the number of matches between k-mers (k-length subsequences) in the two sequences. Extending this definition, by considering two k-mers to match if their distance is at most m, yields better classification performance. This, however, makes the problem computationally much more complex. Known algorithms to compute this similarity have computational complexity that render them applicable only for small values of k and m. In this work, we develop novel techniques to efficiently and accurately estimate the pairwise similarity score, which enables us to use much larger values of k and m, and get higher predictive accuracy. This opens up a broad avenue of applying this classification approach to audio, images, and text sequences. Our algorithm achieves excellent approximation performance with theoretical guarantees. In the process we solve an open combinatorial problem, which was posed as a major hindrance to the scalability of existing solutions. We give analytical bounds on quality and runtime of our algorithm and report its empirical performance on real world biological and music sequences datasets.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2017-12\n\n**Published:** 2017-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Programmers\n\n*From Search Query: fast kernel computation*\n\n*J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, Kazuki Irie, Imanol Schlag*\n\n**Abstract:** We show the formal equivalence of linearised self-attention mechanisms and fast weight controllers from the early '90s, where a ``slow\" neural net learns by gradient descent to program the ``fast weights\" of another net through sequences of elementary programming instructions which are additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (today called keys and values). Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-22\n\n\n\n#### 4. CARAFE: Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures\n\n*From Search Query: fast kernel computation*\n\n*Rui Xu, Kai Chen, Jiaqi Wang, Chen Change Loy, Ziwei Liu, Dahua Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Feature upsampling is a key operation in a number of modern convolutional network architectures, e.g. feature pyramids. Its design is critical for dense prediction tasks such as object detection and semantic/instance segmentation. In this work, we propose Content-Aware ReAssembly of FEatures (CARAFE), a universal, lightweight and highly effective operator to fulfill this goal. CARAFE has several appealing properties: (1) Large field of view. Unlike previous works (e.g. bilinear interpolation) that only exploit sub-pixel neighborhood, CARAFE can aggregate contextual information within a large receptive field. (2) Content-aware handling. Instead of using a fixed kernel for all samples (e.g. deconvolution), CARAFE enables instance-specific content-aware handling, which generates adaptive kernels on-the-fly. (3) Lightweight and fast to compute. CARAFE introduces little computational overhead and can be readily integrated into modern network architectures. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on standard benchmarks in object detection, instance/semantic segmentation and inpainting. CARAFE shows consistent and substantial gains across all the tasks (1.2%, 1.3%, 1.8%, 1.1db respectively) with negligible computational overhead. It has great potential to serve as a strong building block for future research. It has great potential to serve as a strong building block for future research.

This method is enhanced by block matrix computations and rejection sampling, making it significantly faster and more efficient, especially for large matrices.\n\n## Random Feature Approximations for Kernel Methods\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss random feature approximations, the concept is closely related to kernel approximations. However, the paper on \"Stationary Kernels and Gaussian Processes on Lie Groups and their Applications\" touches on approximating stationary kernels using linear combinations of functions, which can be seen as a form of random feature approximation. This method involves discretizing the integral using Monte Carlo techniques, similar to the approach in random feature approximations.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Kernel Implementations\n- The accelerated RPCholesky method described in the sources leverages block computations to take advantage of modern computer architectures, which are optimized for processing blocks of data rather than individual columns. This approach can lead to significant speedups, making the kernel computation more hardware-efficient.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Kernel Computation Techniques\n- The Block Basis Factorization (BBF) method proposed in another paper offers a structured low-rank approximation technique. This method is designed to be memory-efficient by factorizing the kernel matrix into a more compact form, which reduces the memory requirements for storing and computing the kernel matrix.\n\n### Summary\n- **Low-Rank Approximations**: Accelerated RPCholesky and Block Basis Factorization (BBF) provide efficient low-rank kernel approximations.\n- **Random Feature Approximations**: Although not directly discussed, the approximation techniques using linear combinations of functions in the context of stationary kernels can be analogous to random feature approximations.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: The use of block computations in accelerated RPCholesky makes the method hardware-efficient.\n- **Memory-Efficient Techniques**: BBF and accelerated RPCholesky offer memory-efficient solutions by reducing the storage and computational requirements for kernel matrices.\n\nThese methods can help in addressing the computational overhead and efficiency concerns in kernel-based computations, which can be beneficial when integrating such techniques into the design of autoregressive language models.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 41/51 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Meila, M. and Zhang, T.

Score: 0.89)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state management transformers\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Recently, many model-based methods have been designed to address this issue, with learning in the imagination of a world model being one of the most prominent approaches. However, while virtually unlimited interaction with a simulated environment sounds appealing, the world model has to be accurate over extended periods of time. Motivated by the success of Transformers in sequence modeling tasks, we introduce IRIS, a data-efficient agent that learns in a world model composed of a discrete autoencoder and an autoregressive Transformer. With the equivalent of only two hours of gameplay in the Atari 100k benchmark, IRIS achieves a mean human normalized score of 1.046, and outperforms humans on 10 out of 26 games, setting a new state of the art for methods without lookahead search.

Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management transformers*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers for Flexible Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management transformers*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that after a single training phase, Modular Transformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with little to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained Transformer models like T5 and BART have advanced the state of the art on a wide range of text generation tasks. Compressing these models into smaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural network compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization are limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this paper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder framework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular Transformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or more consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and knowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly assembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different performance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a single training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular Transformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with little to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FedML Parrot: A Scalable Federated Learning System via Heterogeneity-aware Scheduling on Sequential and Hierarchical Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management transformers*\n\n*Chaoyang He, Salman Avestimehr, Alex Qiaozhong Liang, Yuxin Wang, Yonggang Zhang, Shaohuai Shi, Sunwoo Lee, Ryan Yide Ran, Xiaowen Chu, Zhenheng Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborations among clients for train machine learning models while protecting their data privacy. Existing FL simulation platforms that are designed from the perspectives of traditional distributed training, suffer from laborious code migration between simulation and production, low efficiency, low GPU utility, low scalability with high hardware requirements and difficulty of simulating stateful clients. In this work, we firstly demystify the challenges and bottlenecks of simulating FL, and design a new FL system named as FedML \\texttt{Parrot}. It improves the training efficiency, remarkably relaxes the requirements on the hardware, and supports efficient large-scale FL experiments with stateful clients by: (1) sequential training clients on devices; (2) decomposing original aggregation into local and global aggregation on devices and server respectively; (3) scheduling tasks to mitigate straggler problems and enhance computing utility; (4) distributed client state manager to support various FL algorithms. Besides, built upon our generic APIs and communication interfaces, users can seamlessly transform the simulation into the real-world deployment without modifying codes. We evaluate \\texttt{Parrot} through extensive experiments for training diverse models on various FL datasets to demonstrate that \\texttt{Parrot} can achieve simulating over 1000 clients (stateful or stateless) with flexible GPU devices setting ($4 \\sim 32$) and high GPU utility, 1.2 $\\sim$ 4 times faster than FedScale, and 10 $\\sim$ 100 times memory saving than FedML. And we verify that \\texttt{Parrot} works well with homogeneous and heterogeneous devices in three different clusters. Two FL algorithms with stateful clients and four algorithms with stateless clients are simulated to verify the wide adaptability of \\texttt{Parrot} to different algorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. SpecFormer: Guarding Vision Transformer Robustness via Maximum Singular Value Penalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management transformers*\n\n*Xing Xie, Qi Wu, Cheuk Hang Leung, Jindong Wang, Runkai Zheng, Xixu Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) are increasingly used in computer vision due to their high performance, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is a concern. Existing methods lack a solid theoretical basis, focusing mainly on empirical training adjustments. This study introduces SpecFormer, tailored to fortify ViTs against adversarial attacks, with theoretical underpinnings. We establish local Lipschitz bounds for the self-attention layer and propose the Maximum Singular Value Penalization (MSVP) to precisely manage these bounds By incorporating MSVP into ViTs' attention layers, we enhance the model's robustness without compromising training efficiency. SpecFormer, the resulting model, outperforms other state-of-the-art models in defending against adversarial attacks, as proven by experiments on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets.

An Image is Worth 32 Tokens for Reconstruction and Generation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management transformers*\n\n*Liang-Chieh Chen, Daniel Cremers, Xiaohui Shen, Xueqing Deng, Mark Weber, Qihang Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in generative models have highlighted the crucial role of image tokenization in the efficient synthesis of high-resolution images. Tokenization, which transforms images into latent representations, reduces computational demands compared to directly processing pixels and enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of the generation process. Prior methods, such as VQGAN, typically utilize 2D latent grids with fixed downsampling factors. However, these 2D tokenizations face challenges in managing the inherent redundancies present in images, where adjacent regions frequently display similarities. To overcome this issue, we introduce Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TiTok), an innovative approach that tokenizes images into 1D latent sequences. TiTok provides a more compact latent representation, yielding substantially more efficient and effective representations than conventional techniques. For example, a 256 x 256 x 3 image can be reduced to just 32 discrete tokens, a significant reduction from the 256 or 1024 tokens obtained by prior methods. Despite its compact nature, TiTok achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, using the same generator framework, TiTok attains 1.97 gFID, outperforming MaskGIT baseline significantly by 4.21 at ImageNet 256 x 256 benchmark. The advantages of TiTok become even more significant when it comes to higher resolution. At ImageNet 512 x 512 benchmark, TiTok not only outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion model DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.74 vs. 3.04), but also reduces the image tokens by 64x, leading to 410x faster generation process. Our best-performing variant can significantly surpasses DiT-XL/2 (gFID 2.13 vs. 3.04) while still generating high-quality samples 74x faster.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state management and memory optimization in transformer architectures, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Hierarchical State Representations\n- The use of hierarchical representations can be inferred from the concept of multi-head attention in Transformers. Each head in the multi-head attention mechanism captures different aspects of the input, allowing for a richer and more hierarchical representation of the input sequence.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Transformer Variants\n- **Intra-Layer Model Parallelism**: This technique allows for the distribution of model computations across multiple GPUs, which is particularly beneficial for training large transformer models. It maintains a scaling efficiency of 76% compared to a single GPU baseline, making it a memory-efficient approach for large models.\n- **Efficient State Space Models (eSSM)**: The eSSM architecture, built on multi-input multi-output (MIMO) state space models, reduces the number of parameters and improves computational efficiency. This model achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster training speed, making it a memory-efficient alternative to traditional Transformers.\n\n### State Compression Techniques\n- **Fast Tensor Convolution and Block Diagonalization**: The eSSM employs techniques such as diagonalization and fast tensor convolution via the fast Fourier transform, along with block diagonalization, to reduce the parameter size and improve model efficiency. These strategies enhance both computational efficiency and model diversity without adding complexity.\n- **Hermes Framework**: This framework optimizes inference for large transformer models on edge devices by using layer profiling, a dynamic execution schedule, and an efficient execution engine. It reduces memory footprint and latency, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Dynamic State Management\n- **Dynamic Execution Schedule**: The Hermes framework uses a Pipeline Planner to devise a PIPELOAD execution schedule that is dynamically adjusted based on real-time memory availability. This ensures efficient and responsive inference even under varying load conditions.\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: SSMs, such as Mamba and eSSM, handle continuous data and long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional Transformers. These models can adapt to different input sequences and capture complex dynamics efficiently, which can be seen as a form of dynamic state management.\n\n### Additional Insights\n- **Memristor-Based Hardware Acceleration**: Using memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the energy efficiency and reduce latency in transformer self-attention mechanisms. This hardware-optimized approach can enhance overall performance and scalability.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models:\n- Utilize hierarchical representations through multi-head attention mechanisms.\n- Implement memory-efficient transformer variants such as eSSM or intra-layer model parallelism.\n- Employ state compression techniques like fast tensor convolution and block diagonalization.\n- Implement dynamic state management using frameworks like Hermes and adaptive execution schedules.\n- Consider hardware-optimized approaches like memristor-based accelerators to further enhance efficiency and performance.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/29 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n1990.

Score: 0.83)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/71 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Just Fine-tune Twice: Selective Differential Privacy for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Weiyan Shi, Si Chen, Chiyuan Zhang, R. Jia, Zhou Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework, *Just Fine-tune Twice* (JFT), that achieves SDP for state-of-the-art large transformer-based models and studies the scenario of imperfect implementation of policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develops systematic methods to handle it.\n\n**Abstract:** Protecting large language models from privacy leakage is becoming increasingly crucial with their wide adoption in real-world products. Yet applying *differential privacy* (DP), a canonical notion with provable privacy guarantees for machine learning models, to those models remains challenging due to the trade-off between model utility and privacy loss. Utilizing the fact that sensitive information in language data tends to be sparse, Shi et al. (2021) formalized a DP notion extension called *Selective Differential Privacy* (SDP) to protect only the sensitive tokens defined by a policy function. However, their algorithm only works for RNN-based models. In this paper, we develop a novel framework, *Just Fine-tune Twice* (JFT), that achieves SDP for state-of-the-art large transformer-based models. Our method is easy to implement: it first fine-tunes the model with *redacted* in-domain data, and then fine-tunes it again with the *original* in-domain data using a private training mechanism. Furthermore, we study the scenario of imperfect implementation of policy functions that misses sensitive tokens and develop systematic methods to handle it. Experiments show that our method achieves strong utility compared to previous baselines. We also analyze the SDP privacy guarantee empirically with the canary insertion attack.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Correspondingly, significant resources are allocated towards research that aims to further advance this technology, typically resulting in models of increasing size that are trained on increasing amounts of data. This work, however, demonstrates the surprising result that it is often possible to significantly improve the performance of LLMs by selectively removing higher-order components of their weight matrices. This simple intervention, which we call LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER), can be done on a model after training has completed, and requires no additional parameters or data. We show extensive experiments demonstrating the generality of this finding across language models and datasets, and provide in-depth analyses offering insights into both when LASER is effective and the mechanism by which it operates.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Fast and Robust Early-Exiting Framework for Autoregressive Language Models with Synchronized Parallel Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Sangmin Bae, Jongwoo Ko, Hwanjun Song, SeYoung Yun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework, which incorporates a shallow-deep module and a synchronized parallel decoding that enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** To tackle the high inference latency exhibited by autoregressive language models, previous studies have proposed an early-exiting framework that allocates adaptive computation paths for each token based on the complexity of generating the subsequent token. However, we observed several shortcomings, including performance degradation caused by a state copying mechanism or numerous exit paths, and sensitivity to exit confidence thresholds. Consequently, we propose a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework, which incorporates a shallow-deep module and a synchronized parallel decoding. Our framework enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens. Furthermore, as parallel decoding allows us to observe predictions from both shallow and deep models, we present a novel adaptive threshold estimator that exploits a Beta mixture model to determine suitable confidence thresholds. We empirically demonstrated the superiority of our proposed framework on extensive generation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Selective Annotation Makes Language Models Better Few-Shot Learners\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Hongjin Su, Jungo Kasai, Chen Henry Wu, Weijia Shi, Tianlu Wang, Jiayi Xin, Rui Zhang, Mari Ostendorf, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Tao Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work forms an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time, and proposes an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotation.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent approaches to natural language tasks are built on the remarkable abilities of large language models. Large language models can perform in-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task demonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the implications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new natural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we formulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets (covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code generation) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task performance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4% relative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly selecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised finetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less annotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our framework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative selective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain shift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as large language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

RARR: Researching and Revising What Language Models Say, Using Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Luyu Gao, Zhuyun Dai, Panupong Pasupat, Anthony Chen, Arun Tejasvi Chaganty, Yicheng Fan, Vincent Zhao, N. Lao, Hongrae Lee, Da-Cheng Juan, Kelvin Guu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes RARR (Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision), a system that automatically finds attribution for the output of any text generation model, and post-edits the output to fix unsupported content while preserving the original output as much as possible.\n\n**Abstract:** Language models (LMs) now excel at many tasks such as question answering, reasoning, and dialog. However, they sometimes generate unsupported or misleading content. A user cannot easily determine whether their outputs are trustworthy or not, because most LMs do not have any built-in mechanism for attribution to external evidence. To enable attribution while still preserving all the powerful advantages of recent generation models, we propose RARR (Retrofit Attribution using Research and Revision), a system that 1) automatically finds attribution for the output of any text generation model, and 2) post-edits the output to fix unsupported content while preserving the original output as much as possible. When applied to the output of several state-of-the-art LMs on a diverse set of generation tasks, we find that RARR significantly improves attribution while otherwise preserving the original input to a much greater degree than previously explored edit models. Furthermore, the implementation of RARR requires only a handful of training examples, a large language model, and standard web search.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 210  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. OxKBC: Outcome Explanation for Factorization Based Knowledge Base Completion\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Mausam, Parag Singla, Mayank Singh Chauhan, Aman Agrawal, Ankesh Gupta, Yatin Nandwani*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models for Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) are based on tensor factorization (TF), e.g, DistMult, ComplEx. While they produce good results, they cannot expose any rationale behind their predictions, potentially reducing the trust of a user in the model. Previous works have explored creating an inherently explainable model, e.g. Neural Theorem Proving (NTP), DeepPath, MINERVA, but explainability comes at the cost of performance. Others have tried to create an auxiliary explainable model having high fidelity with the underlying TF model, but unfortunately, they do not scale on large KBs such as FB15k and YAGO.\u00a0In this work, we propose OxKBC -- an Outcome eXplanation engine for KBC, which provides a post-hoc explanation for every triple inferred by an (uninterpretable) factorization based model. It first augments the underlying Knowledge Graph by introducing weighted edges between entities based on their similarity given by the underlying model. In the augmented graph, it defines a notion of human-understandable explanation paths along with a language to generate them. Depending on the edges, the paths are aggregated into second-order templates for further selection.

Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. FAT-DeepFFM: Field Attentive Deep Field-aware Factorization Machine\n\n*From Search Query: selective state mechanism language models*\n\n*Junlin Zhang, Zhiqi Zhang, Tongwen Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Click through rate (CTR) estimation is a fundamental task in personalized advertising and recommender systems. Recent years have witnessed the success of both the deep learning based model and attention mechanism in various tasks in computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP). How to combine the attention mechanism with deep CTR model is a promising direction because it may ensemble the advantages of both sides. Although some CTR model such as Attentional Factorization Machine (AFM) has been proposed to model the weight of second order interaction features, we posit the evaluation of feature importance before explicit feature interaction procedure is also important for CTR prediction tasks because the model can learn to selectively highlight the informative features and suppress less useful ones if the task has many input features. In this paper, we propose a new neural CTR model named Field Attentive Deep Field-aware Factorization Machine (FAT-DeepFFM) by combining the Deep Field-aware Factorization Machine (DeepFFM) with Compose-Excitation network (CENet) field attention mechanism which is proposed by us as an enhanced version of Squeeze-Excitation network (SENet) to highlight the feature importance. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and the experiment results show that FAT-DeepFFM achieves the best performance and obtains different improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. We also compare two kinds of attention mechanisms (attention before explicit feature interaction vs. attention after explicit feature interaction) and demonstrate that the former one outperforms the latter one significantly.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design using selective state mechanisms, here are the key findings and details from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Details of Selective State Updates\n\n- The Mamba model, which integrates selective state space models (SSMs), allows for the selective propagation or forgetting of information based on the current token. This is achieved by making SSM parameters functions of the input, enabling the model to address the weakness of traditional SSMs in content-based reasoning.\n- The Taipan model, a hybrid architecture, combines the efficiency of Mamba with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to handle long-range dependencies. It selectively applies attention only to tokens that benefit from it, optimizing resource allocation and maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## Efficiency Considerations\n\n- Mamba models utilize a selective SSM mechanism that offers constant memory usage during inference, which is a significant improvement over Transformers that suffer from quadratic computational complexity and linear memory growth with context length.\n- The use of a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in Mamba allows for fast inference with up to 5 times higher throughput than Transformers and linear scaling in sequence length, making it highly efficient for long sequences.\n- Post-training quantization techniques for SSMs, such as the method proposed in the Quamba paper, can further reduce the model size and leverage low bit-width acceleration features, resulting in lower generation latency without significant loss in accuracy.\n\n## Performance Comparisons with Traditional Approaches\n\n- Mamba models have been shown to outperform similarly sized Transformers and match the performance of larger Transformers in both pretraining and downstream evaluation tasks. This is due to the selective state space mechanism that enhances content-based reasoning.\n- Taipan, which combines Mamba's efficiency with selective attention, demonstrates superior performance across various scales and tasks, particularly in scenarios requiring extensive in-context retrieval, while maintaining computational efficiency.\n- In comparison to traditional sequence-to-sequence models, sparse sequence-to-sequence models like Mamba and S6, which leverage selective mechanisms, have shown promising results in enhancing efficiency and scalability. They excel in tasks such as selective copying and prefix matching, showcasing their ability to manage context effectively.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- The selective state mechanism in Mamba and similar models allows for dynamic state management, which is more efficient than the hierarchical approach used in some current models. This selective mechanism can be fine-tuned to project the selection onto different dimensions, significantly impacting model performance.\n- The integration of SSM components with other architectures, such as the hybrid approach in Taipan, can address the limitations of traditional Transformers in handling long-range dependencies and in-context retrieval.\n\nThese findings suggest that incorporating selective state mechanisms, such as those in Mamba and Taipan, can significantly improve the efficiency, performance, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

The scalar SSM scan is defined as computing the recurrent part of the discrete SSM (7), in the case when $N=1$ (i.e. $A$ is a scalar). This is commonly used to compute SSMs recurrently; in particular, the case of structured SSMs where $A$ is diagonally structured reduces down to this operation, such as in the S5 (J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and S6 (Gu and Dao 2023) models. The goal of this section is to support a central theme of this paper that efficient algorithms for sequence models can be viewed as structured matrix multiplication algorithms. The various matrix decomposition ideas we show here are related to ideas used to derive fast SSM algorithms (Section 6), as well as directly used as a subroutine. ## B. 1 Problem Definition\n\nLet $a:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) and $b:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) be sequences of scalars. The scalar SSM scan is defined as\n\n$$\nh_{t}=a_{t} h_{t-1}+b_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $h_{-1}$ can be an arbitrary value representing the previous hidden state to the SSM recurrence; unless otherwise specified, we assume $h_{-1}=0$. We also call equation (21) the cumprodsum (cumulative product sum). Note that the cumprodsum reduces to the cumprod (cumulative product) when $b=0$ is the additive identity and it reduces to the cumsum (cumulative sum) when $a=1$ is the multiplicative identity. Finally, note that in vectorized form we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh & =M b \\\\\nM & =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & & & & \\\\\na_{1} & 1 & & & \\\\\na_{2} a_{1} & a_{2} & 1 & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\na_{T-1} \\ldots a_{1} & a_{T-1} \\ldots a_{2} & \\ldots & a_{T-1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, this is simply the matrix-vector product by a 1-SS matrix $M$. Therefore we have three ways of viewing this fundamental primitive operation that are all equivalent:\n\n- A (scalar) SSM scan. - A cumprodsum. - A 1-SS matrix-vector multiplication . ## B. 2 Classical Algorithms\n\nWe first describe the two classical ways of computing the SSM scan (21), previously used by prior work. ## B.2.1 Sequential Recurrence\n\nThe recurrent mode simply computes (21) one timestep $t$ at a time. From the perspective of 1-SS multiplication, this was also described in Section 3.4.1. ## B.2.2 Parallel Associative Scan\n\nSecond, an important observation is that this recurrence can be turned into an associative scan (E.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/53 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Mexico City, Mexico, 2021.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

In NVIDIA terms, GPU streaming multiprocessors launch thread blocks at the software level. These blocks are divided into warps (e.g. 32 threads) that are assigned to cores at the hardware level. Threads need to read inputs into their registers to perform computations and write the outputs. The time taken to read and write is referred to as the IO cost. Operations could either be memory or compute bound, depending on the time to load data vs. perform computations on loaded data. In designing our IO-aware algorithms, we would like to exploit two key properties of modern GPUs. First, tensor core units (fast matrix multiply units) achieve $312 \\mathrm{TFLOP} / \\mathrm{s}$ speeds relative to $19 \\mathrm{TFLOP} / \\mathrm{s}$ for the non-matrix multiply cores. Second, GPUs face a memory hierarchy with large amounts of slow-to-access memory and smaller amounts of fast-to-access memory. The access speed is governed by the proximitiy of the processor to the data address. For instance, the hierarchy on a modern NVIDIA 80GB A100 GPU is: 80 GB of HBM with $2 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth, 80 MB of L 2 cache, 192 KB of L1 cache / shared memory (implemented via SRAM) with $19 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth per SM, and 256 KB of register file per SM [33].\n```\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.28)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/44 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nGPU gems, 3(39):851-876, 2007.

Consider a convolutional recurrence as in (7) and define initial parallel scan elements $c_{k}=\\left(c_{k, a}, c_{k, b}\\right):=\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}, \\overline{\\mathcal{B}} * \\mathcal{U}_{k}\\right)$.

Proof. Using that $\\circ$ is associative and the companion operator of $*$, i.e. $(d \\circ e) * f=d *(e * f)$ (see Blelloch [63], Section 1.4), we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(c_{i} \\circledast c_{j}\\right) \\circledast c_{k} & =\\left(c_{j, a} \\circ c_{i, a}, c_{j, a} * c_{i, b}+c_{j, b}\\right) \\circledast\\left(c_{k, a}, c_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(c_{k, a} \\circ\\left(c_{j, a} \\circ c_{i, a}\\right), \\quad c_{k, a} *\\left(c_{j, a} * c_{i, b}+c_{j, b}\\right)+c_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\left(c_{k, a} \\circ c_{j, a}\\right) \\circ c_{i, a}, \\quad c_{k, a} *\\left(c_{j, a} * c_{i, b}\\right)+c_{k, a} * c_{j, b}+c_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\left(c_{k, a} \\circ c_{j, a}\\right) \\circ c_{i, a},\\left(c_{k, a} \\circ c_{j, a}\\right) * c_{i, b}+c_{k, a} * c_{j, b}+c_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =c_{i} \\circledast\\left(c_{k, a} \\circ c_{j, a}, c_{k, a} * c_{j, b}+c_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =c_{i} \\circledast\\left(c_{j} \\circledast c_{k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## A. 2 Computational Cost of Parallel Scan for Convolutional Recurrences\n\nProposition 2. Given the effective inputs $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}} * \\mathcal{U}_{1: L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times H \\times W \\times P}$ and a pointwise state kernel $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P \\times P \\times 1 \\times 1}$, the computational cost of computing the convolutional recurrence in Equation 7 with a parallel scan is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L\\left(P^{3}+P^{2} H W\\right)\\right)$. Proof. Following Blelloch [63], given a single processor, the cost of computing the recurrence sequentially using the binary operator $\\circledast$ defined in Proposition 1 is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L\\left(T_{\\circ}+T_{*}+T_{+}\\right)\\right)$where $T_{\\circ}$ refers to the cost of convolving two kernels, $T_{*}$ is the cost of convolution between a kernel and input and $T_{+}$is the cost of elementwise addition. The cost of elementwise addition is $T_{+}=\\mathcal{O}(P H W)$. For state kernels with resolution $k_{A}, T_{\\circ}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(P^{3} k_{A}^{4}\\right)$ and $T_{*}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(P^{2} k_{A}^{2} H W\\right)$. For pointwise convolutions this becomes $T_{\\circ}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(P^{3}\\right)$ and $T_{*}=\\mathcal{O}\\left(P^{2} H W\\right)$. Thus, the cost of computing the recurrence sequentially using $\\circledast$ is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L\\left(P^{3}+P^{2} H W\\right)\\right)$. Since there are work-efficient algorithms for parallel scans [105], the overall cost of the parallel scan is also $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L\\left(P^{3}+P^{2} H W\\right)\\right)$. Note that ConvS5's diagonalized parameterization discussed in Section 3.4 and Appendix B leads to $T_{\\circ}=\\mathcal{O}(P)$ and $T_{*}=\\mathcal{O}(P H W)$. Therefore the cost of applying the parallel scan with ConvS5 is $\\mathcal{O}(L P H W)$.\n```\n\n#### 5. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient kernel computation scan algorithm*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

However, treatments may have effects beyond the mean, for instance decreasing or increasing the variance. We propose a new kernel-based test for distributional effects of the treatment. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first kernel-based, doubly-robust test with provably valid type-I error. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, avoiding the use of permutations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

On target densities where classical HMC is not an option due to intractable gradients, KMC adaptively learns the target's gradient structure by fitting an exponential family model in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Computational costs are reduced by two novel efficient approximations to this gradient. While being asymptotically exact, KMC mimics HMC in terms of sampling efficiency, and offers substantial mixing improvements over state-of-the-art gradient free samplers.

Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient kernel computation scan algorithm*\n\n*Si Si, Cho-Jui Hsieh, I. Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new kernel approximation algorithm - Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix and shows that the resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low- rank kernel approximation methods in terms of speed, approximation error, and memory usage.\n\n**Abstract:** The scalability of kernel machines is a big challenge when facing millions of samples due to storage and computation issues for large kernel matrices, that are usually dense. Recently, many papers have suggested tackling this problem by using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. In this paper, we first make the observation that the structure of shift-invariant kernels changes from low-rank to block-diagonal (without any low-rank structure) when varying the scale parameter. Based on this observation, we propose a new kernel approximation algorithm - Memory Efficient Kernel Approximation (MEKA), which considers both low-rank and clustering structure of the kernel matrix. We show that the resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art low-rank kernel approximation methods in terms of speed, approximation error, and memory usage. As an example, on the mnist2m dataset with two-million samples, our method takes 550 seconds on a single machine using less than 500 MBytes memory to achieve 0.2313 test RMSE for kernel ridge regression, while standard Nystrom approximation takes more than 2700 seconds and uses more than 2 GBytes memory on the same problem to achieve 0.2318 test RMSE.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 152  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. PENNI: Pruned Kernel Sharing for Efficient CNN Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient kernel computation scan algorithm*\n\n*Shiyu Li, Edward Hanson, H. Li, Yiran Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** PENNI is proposed, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints.\n\n**Abstract:** Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs achieve outstanding performance on various tasks, their high computation demand and massive number of parameters make it difficult to deploy these SOTA CNNs onto resource-constrained devices. Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune 97% parameters and 92% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and achieve 44% reduction in run-time memory consumption and a 53% reduction in inference latency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design with a focus on hardware-efficient kernel computation, scan-based algorithms, and memory optimization, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hardware-Aware Kernel Computation Techniques\n\n- The paper on \"A resource-efficient model for Deep Kernel Learning\" discusses model-level decomposition approaches that are hardware-aware. It highlights the use of kernel decomposition, data reduction, and localization of the predictive function to improve efficiency. This approach involves solving smaller problems in parallel, which can be optimized for GPU and distributed memory architectures, ensuring scalability and efficiency.\n\n## Efficient Scan Algorithms for State Updates\n\n- The analysis note suggests using scan-based computation instead of convolution to optimize state updates. This is supported by the excerpt from \"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces,\" which describes a hardware-aware parallel algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan, avoiding the materialization of expanded states to reduce IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies for Kernel Methods\n\n- To optimize memory usage, the approach of using dynamic selective state mechanisms instead of fixed hierarchical levels is recommended. This is detailed in the analysis note, which suggests making kernel parameters input-dependent and implementing selective propagation of information. This method reduces the need to store unnecessary state information, thus optimizing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n## GPU-Optimized Implementations\n\n- The paper on \"A resource-efficient model for Deep Kernel Learning\" emphasizes the use of fine-grained and coarse-grained parallelism to exploit GPU capabilities. It discusses the use of concurrency in operators and problem decomposition to enhance performance on GPU architectures. This involves exploiting multiple levels of parallelism and using specialized hardware like GPUs and TPUs to handle parallel operations efficiently.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Effective Threadblock Scheduling**: For GPU-optimized implementations, effective threadblock scheduling can be crucial. This involves distributing the computation among the Compute Thread Arrays (CTAs) to achieve good load balancing and higher performance, as discussed in the context of efficient GEMM kernel designs.\n\n- **Sub-Sampling Methods**: While not directly related to traditional kernel methods, the sub-sampling approach for quantum kernel alignment can provide insights into reducing computational costs. This method involves using a subset of the kernel matrix at each training step, which can significantly reduce the number of queries and computational cost, potentially applicable to other kernel-based methods.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop a more efficient autoregressive language model design that is optimized for hardware, utilizes efficient scan algorithms for state updates, and employs memory optimization techniques. This approach will help in achieving better performance, scalability, and efficiency in training and inference.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/74 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nAll models have roughly 6 M total parameters. ## E. 5 Efficiency Benchmark\n\nScan Operation. We compare the core operation of selective SSMs, which is the parallel scan (Section 3.3), against convolution and attention, measured on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Note that these do not include the cost of other operations outside of this core operation, such as computing the convolutional kernel in global-convolution models, or computing the QKV projections in attention. As a baseline, we implement a standard parallel scan in PyTorch with no kernel fusion. This requires materializing the parameters $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C$ in HBM. Our scan implementation fuses the discretization step and the parallel scan, avoiding the cost of materializing all the large parameters in HBM. Table 15: (Memory benchmark.) Mamba's memory footprint is comparable to the most optimized Transformer. Results for 125M models. | Batch size | Transformer (w/ FlashAttention-2) | Mamba |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 4.6 GB | 4.8 GB |\n| 2 | 5.2 GB | 5.8 GB |\n| 4 | 6.9 GB | 7.3 GB |\n| 8 | 11.5 GB | 12.3 GB |\n| 16 | 20.7 GB | 23.1 GB |\n| 32 | 34.5 GB | 38.2 GB |\n\nFor convolution, we use the standard implementation in PyTorch, which separately performs FFTs on the inputs and the filters, multiply them in frequency domain, then performs an inverse FFT to obtain the result. The theoretical complexity is $O(L \\log (L))$ for sequence length $L$. For attention, we compare against the fastest implementation that we are aware of (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), with causal mask. Note that FlashAttention-2 with causal mask is about $1.7 \\times$ faster than without causal mask, since approximately only half of the attention entries are computed. We use batch size of 1 and increase the sequence length from $2^{9}=512,2^{10} \\approx 1 K, 2^{11} \\approx 2 K$, up to $2^{19} \\approx 500 K$ (some of the baselines run out of memory before reaching 500 K ). We use a model dimension of $D=1024$ and state dimension $N=16$. We measure with BF16 inputs, which is the data type most commonly used for large scale training. End-to-end Inference. We measure the inference throughput of a Mamba 1.4B model and an untrained Mamba 6.9B model, against a standard Transformer (GPT3 architecture) at 1.3B and 6.7B size. We use the standard Transformer implementation in the Huggingface transformers library. We set the prompt length to be 2048 and the generation length to be 128 . We vary the batch size from $1,2,4,8,16$, 32,64 , to 128 , and measure time time taken to generate 128 tokens. We then calculate the throughput (tokens/s) as batch size $\\times 128$ /time taken. We repeat the measurements 3 times and take the average. Measurements are done on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Memory Benchmark. The memory usage simply scales proportionally to the size of the activation tensors, as with most deep sequence models. We report measurements of the training memory requirements of 125 M models on 1 A100 80GB GPU. Each batch consists of sequences of length 2048. We compare to the most memory-efficient Transformer implementation we are aware of (with kernel fusion from torch. compile and with FlashAttention-2). Table 15 shows that Mamba's memory requirement is comparable to a similar-sized Transformer with an extremely optimized implementation, and we expect further improvement in Mamba's memory footprint in the future.\n```\n\n#### 2. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

All experiments are conducted using an NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU. Note that during training, the sequence length and batch dimensions are flattened, making the effective batch size the product of these dimensions. Our experiments show that our fused operator benefits from larger batch sizes in terms of faster training speeds and reduced memory consumption. When the batch size is $2^{8}$, the training speed of the 1.3 B parameter model improves from 1.52 s to 1.21 s per iteration, a $25.6 \\%$ speedup over the vanilla implementation. Additionally, memory consumption decreases from 82 GB to 32 GB , a $61.0 \\%$ reduction in memory usage. The performance of the Fused implementation improves significantly with larger batch sizes, allowing more samples to be processed simultaneously and reducing the total number of iterations. ### 4.5 Inference Efficiency Comparison\n\nFig. 4(d) presents a comparison of GPU inference memory consumption and latency between the proposed MatMul-free LM and Transformer++ for various model sizes. In the MatMul-free LM, we employ BitBLAS [60] for acceleration to further improve efficiency. The evaluation is conducted with a batch size of 1 and a sequence length of 2048. The MatMul-free LM consistently demonstrates lower memory usage and latency compared to Transformer++ across all model sizes. For a single layer, the MatMul-free LM requires only 0.12 GB of GPU memory and achieves a latency of 3.79 ms , while Transformer++ consumes 0.21 GB of memory and has a latency of 13.87 ms . As the model size increases, the memory and latency advantages of the MatMul-free LM become more pronounced. It is worth noting that for model sizes larger than 2.7 B , the results are simulated using randomly initialized weights. For the largest model size of 13B parameters, the MatMul-free LM uses only 4.19 GB of GPU memory and has a latency of 695.48 ms , whereas Transformer++ requires 48.50 GB of memory and exhibits a latency of 3183.10 ms . These results highlight the efficiency gains achieved by the MatMul-free LM, making it a promising approach for large-scale language modeling tasks, particularly during inference. ## 5 FPGA Implementation and Results\n\n### 5.1 Implementation\n\nTo test the power usage and effectiveness of the MatMul-free LM on custom hardware that can better exploit ternary operations, we created an FPGA accelerator in SystemVerilog.\n```\n\n#### 3. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

To reduce the time required for reads and writes, a key principle is to fuse multiple operations on the same data slice while it's in fast memory before writing it back to slow memory. ### 5.1 Taylor Exponential Linear Attention\n\nDespite the theoretically improved complexity, the linear attention methods demonstrated in prior work are often less efficient than highly-optimized softmax attention implementations (Flash Attention [12]) when measured in real-world wall-clock time and memory usage. We next present hardware-aware algorithms to make Taylor linear attention efficient. We focus on two operations: (1) prefill, corresponding to processing the prompt during generation or the forward pass during training, and (2) next token prediction during generation, which also requires updating the recurrent hidden state state. In this section, we refer to the batch size as $B$, number of heads as $H$, head dimension as $d$, sequence length as $N$ and feature dimension as $d^{\\prime}$, following Section 4 . For ease of notation, let $D=1+d^{\\prime}+d^{\\prime 2}$ in this section. Additional details for the IO-Aware algorithms are included in Appendix B. ### 5.1.1 Forward Pass / Generation Prefill\n\nBaseline Implementation The na\u00efve implementation detailed in Appendix B (1) produces the feature maps $Q, K,(2)$ computes and materializes the large hidden state $K V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times d \\times D}$, then (3) computes the causal dot product between $Q$ and $K V$. Prior work has released popular CUDA kernels for linear attention to efficiently perform the causal dot product / step (3) 34. The kernel parallelizes computation across the heads and batches, loads tiles of $V$ and $K$ to SRAM, updates the running $K V$ state in SRAM, loads tiles of $Q$ to SRAM, produces the final output in SRAM, and writes the result to HBM. Analysis In overall IO cost, ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, this procedure requires $2 B H N D$ bytes for writing featurized $Q, K$ to HBM. During the causal dot product, this requires $2 B H N D+B H N d$ bytes to read $Q, K, V$ tiles and $B H N d$ bytes to write the result. Throughout the computation, $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes (note this is the shape $K V$ state during the forward pass) are read in and out of thread registers to SRAM to update the running output and $K V$ state at $19 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth. Algorithm To improve efficiency, our algorithm computes both the feature map and the causal dot product in fast memory. Our overall algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1 and we discuss the overall process here. The algorithm first parallelizes over the batch $B$ and head $H$ dimensions, since computation is independent for each head in each batch. We consider the three terms $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ in the linear attention output, corresponding to the three terms in the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor polynomial for the exponential. We also consider the corresponding three terms, in the cumulative $K V$ state as we process a sequence. For a given tile (i.e. sub-matrix) of $Q, K, V$, we load the tiles (e.g., tile of $Q, K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 16}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 64}$ given 16 tokens, 16 feature dimension, and 64 head dimension) into fast memory and update the running $K V$ state and output for each of the three terms. We load the tiles into the register file and fuse-operations to compute the causal dot product in register, only writing to SRAM to synchronize the cumulative $K V$ state across parallel warps. We use explicit writes to SRAM for this synchronization because register memory is warp-specific (threads in one warp do not access the registers for a thread in a different warp). Analysis In IO cost, again ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, our procedure requires $2 B H N d^{\\prime}$ bytes for reading $q, k$ and $2 B H N d$ bytes for reading $v$ and writing output $y$ between HBM and SRAM. Overall, our algorithm avoids in HBM $\\mathcal{O}(2 B H N D)$ bytes in HBM to SRAM data movement. We additionally improve upon the baseline by performing computation in-register to avoid the $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes in SRAM to register data movement. ### 5.1.2 Next token prediction\n\nDuring next token prediction, an important consideration is how to efficiently update the recurrent state $K V_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D d}$ at timestep $t$. The expensive operation during next token prediction is computing the outer product between projected hidden states $k_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D}$ and $v_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H d}$. The outer product requires $\\mathcal{O}(B H D d)$ computation and space, and the result is summed with $K V_{t}$ to produce $K V_{t+1}$. We provide an IO-aware algorithm for the state updates in Algorithm 2. This algorithm incurs $\\mathcal{O}(B H D+B H d)$ bytes of HBM to SRAM data movement (to load the $q, k, v$ projections). ## 5.2 tcWindow\n\nNext we motivate the choice of window size for TCWINDOW. In contrast to sliding-window style models such as the popular Mistral models, which use large window sizes $w=4096$ [10], BASED chooses a window size based on hardware specifications. GPU tensor cores operate on $16 \\times 16$ tiles. Large GEMMs are compute bound (for e.g. in long-context attention). But, we need sufficient occupancy to hide the latency of the tensor core units. Figure 1 (Right) shows $64 \\times 64$ dimension matrix multiplications are approximately the same latency as $16 \\times 16$. BASED sets $w$ to use $64 \\times 64$ tiles (Figure 1). To distinguish from prior sliding windows, we refer to this approach as TCWindow. We use the Flash Attention sliding window implementation during training [11] and in Appendix B Algorithm 3, we provide an IO-aware algorithm of TCWindow for next token prediction. End-to-end benchmarks for BASED implemented with these IO-aware algorithms are provided in Section 6 . Micro-benchmarks for each kernel against the baseline implementations are provided in Appendix B. ## 6 Results\n\nIn this section, we present results for the following claims:\n\n1. Language modeling overall. We evaluate architectures in pretraining from scratch on the Pile 330] and on standard benchmarks from the LM Eval Harness [16.

DreamShard: Generalizable Embedding Table Placement for Recommender Systems\n\n*From Search Query: scan operations production systems*\n\n*D. Zha, Louis Feng, Qiaoyu Tan, Zirui Liu, Kwei-Herng Lai, Bhargav Bhushanam, Yuandong Tian, A. Kejariwal, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** DreamShard is presented, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for embedding table placement that substantially outperforms the existing human expert and RNN-based strategies with up to 19% speedup over the strongest baseline on large-scale synthetic tables and the authors' production tables.\n\n**Abstract:** We study embedding table placement for distributed recommender systems, which aims to partition and place the tables on multiple hardware devices (e.g., GPUs) to balance the computation and communication costs. Although prior work has explored learning-based approaches for the device placement of computational graphs, embedding table placement remains to be a challenging problem because of 1) the operation fusion of embedding tables, and 2) the generalizability requirement on unseen placement tasks with different numbers of tables and/or devices. To this end, we present DreamShard, a reinforcement learning (RL) approach for embedding table placement. DreamShard achieves the reasoning of operation fusion and generalizability with 1) a cost network to directly predict the costs of the fused operation, and 2) a policy network that is efficiently trained on an estimated Markov decision process (MDP) without real GPU execution, where the states and the rewards are estimated with the cost network. Equipped with sum and max representation reductions, the two networks can directly generalize to any unseen tasks with different numbers of tables and/or devices without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that DreamShard substantially outperforms the existing human expert and RNN-based strategies with up to 19% speedup over the strongest baseline on large-scale synthetic tables and our production tables.

We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 237  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 3.

With an increasing demand to deal with massive instances and variables, it is important to scale up and parallelize L-BFGS effectively in a distributed system. In this paper, we study the problem of parallelizing the L-BFGS algorithm in large clusters of tens of thousands of shared-nothing commodity machines. First, we show that a naive implementation of L-BFGS using Map-Reduce requires either a significant amount of memory or a large number of map-reduce steps with negative performance impact. Second, we propose a new L-BFGS algorithm, called Vector-free L-BFGS, which avoids the expensive dot product operations in the two loop recursion and greatly improves computation efficiency with a great degree of parallelism. The algorithm scales very well and enables a variety of machine learning algorithms to handle a massive number of variables over large datasets. We prove the mathematical equivalence of the new Vector-free L-BFGS and demonstrate its excellent performance and scalability using real-world machine learning problems with billions of variables in production clusters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4.

Salakhutdinov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work carefully defines several sources of representational biases before proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them and demonstrates effectiveness in mitigating bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text generation, thereby pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.\n\n**Abstract:** As machine learning methods are deployed in real-world settings such as healthcare, legal systems, and social science, it is crucial to recognize how they shape social biases and stereotypes in these sensitive decision-making processes. Among such real-world deployments are large-scale pretrained language models (LMs) that can be potentially dangerous in manifesting undesirable representational biases - harmful biases resulting from stereotyping that propagate negative generalizations involving gender, race, religion, and other social constructs. As a step towards improving the fairness of LMs, we carefully define several sources of representational biases before proposing new benchmarks and metrics to measure them. With these tools, we propose steps towards mitigating social biases during text generation. Our empirical results and human evaluation demonstrate effectiveness in mitigating bias while retaining crucial contextual information for high-fidelity text generation, thereby pushing forward the performance-fairness Pareto frontier.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 308  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 5.

Recent QE models have achieved previously-unseen levels of correlation with human judgments, but they rely on large multilingual contextualized language models that are computationally expensive and make them infeasible for real-world applications. In this work, we evaluate several model compression techniques for QE and find that, despite their popularity in other NLP tasks, they lead to poor performance in this regression setting. We observe that a full model parameterization is required to achieve SoTA results in a regression task. However, we argue that the level of expressiveness of a model in a continuous range is unnecessary given the downstream applications of QE, and show that reframing QE as a classification problem and evaluating QE models using classification metrics would better reflect their actual performance in real-world applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Capturing Structural Locality in Non-parametric Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: real-world performance metrics language models*\n\n*Frank F. Xu, Junxian He, Graham Neubig, Vincent J. Hellendoorn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach for adding locality information into non-parametric language models by adding learned parameters that improve the likelihood of retrieving examples from local neighborhoods.\n\n**Abstract:** Structural locality is a ubiquitous feature of real-world datasets, wherein data points are organized into local hierarchies. Some examples include topical clusters in text or project hierarchies in source code repositories. In this paper, we explore utilizing this structural locality within non-parametric language models, which generate sequences that reference retrieved examples from an external source. We propose a simple yet effective approach for adding locality information into such models by adding learned parameters that improve the likelihood of retrieving examples from local neighborhoods. Experiments on two different domains, Java source code and Wikipedia text, demonstrate that locality features improve model efficacy over models without access to these features, with interesting differences. We also perform an analysis of how and where locality features contribute to improved performance and why the traditionally used contextual similarity metrics alone are not enough to grasp the locality structure.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

We propose CONFIG (CONstrained efFIcient Global Optimization), a simple and effective algorithm to solve it. Under certain regularity assumptions, we show that our algorithm enjoys the same cumulative regret bound as that in the unconstrained case and similar cumulative constraint violation upper bounds. For commonly used Matern and Squared Exponential kernels, our bounds are sublinear and allow us to derive a convergence rate to the optimal solution of the original constrained problem. In addition, our method naturally provides a scheme to declare infeasibility when the original black-box optimization problem is infeasible. Numerical experiments on sampled instances from the Gaussian process, artificial numerical problems, and a black-box building controller tuning problem all demonstrate the competitive performance of our algorithm.

Parallel-mentoring for Offline Model-based Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization case studies*\n\n*Can Chen, Christopher Beckham, Zixuan Liu, Xue Liu, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes \\textit{parallel-mentoring} as an effective and novel method that facilitates mentoring among parallel proxies, creating a more robust ensemble to mitigate the out-of-distribution issue.\n\n**Abstract:** We study offline model-based optimization to maximize a black-box objective function with a static dataset of designs and scores. These designs encompass a variety of domains, including materials, robots and DNA sequences. A common approach trains a proxy on the static dataset to approximate the black-box objective function and performs gradient ascent to obtain new designs. However, this often results in poor designs due to the proxy inaccuracies for out-of-distribution designs. Recent studies indicate that: (a) gradient ascent with a mean ensemble of proxies generally outperforms simple gradient ascent, and (b) a trained proxy provides weak ranking supervision signals for design selection. Motivated by (a) and (b), we propose \\textit{parallel-mentoring} as an effective and novel method that facilitates mentoring among parallel proxies, creating a more robust ensemble to mitigate the out-of-distribution issue. We focus on the three-proxy case and our method consists of two modules. The first module, \\textit{voting-based pairwise supervision}, operates on three parallel proxies and captures their ranking supervision signals as pairwise comparison labels. These labels are combined through majority voting to generate consensus labels, which incorporate ranking supervision signals from all proxies and enable mutual mentoring. However, label noise arises due to possible incorrect consensus. To alleviate this, we introduce an \\textit{adaptive soft-labeling} module with soft-labels initialized as consensus labels. Based on bi-level optimization, this module fine-tunes proxies in the inner level and learns more accurate labels in the outer level to adaptively mentor proxies, resulting in a more robust ensemble. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.

To address these issues and enhance the billing process, we propose an innovative solution that automates billing while effectively managing sales data. Our system features a conveyor belt mechanism activated by a touch sensor, where products, each with unique QR codes, are placed. A camera captures live video of the conveyor belt, enabling real-time detection and decoding of these QR codes, along with immediate alerts for any expired products identified. The system generates a comprehensive bill detailing product names, IDs, and prices, while securely storing scanned data in a database for in-depth sales and profit analysis, complemented by graphical visualizations. Registered customers receive a PDF copy of their bill via email through the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), enhancing their overall experience. By employing the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) model alongside the Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT) algorithm, the system ensures precise object tracking and accurate scanning of each product. The Raspberry Pi serves as the core component of the system, managing the integration of advanced hardware and software.

RAFT: Reward rAnked FineTuning for Generative Foundation Model Alignment\n\n*From Search Query: real-world performance metrics language models*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Kashun Shum, Jipeng Zhang, Shizhe Diao, Winnie Chow, Yihan Zhang, Rui Pan, Deepanshu Goyal, Wei Xiong, Hanze Dong*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative foundation models are susceptible to implicit biases that can arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially serious consequences. Consequently, aligning these models with human ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to address this problem, where generative models are fine-tuned with RL algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment, necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT), designed to align generative models effectively. Utilizing a reward model and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently enhancing the model by fine-tuning on these filtered samples. Our studies show that RAFT can effectively improve the model performance in both reward learning and other automated metrics in both large language models and diffusion models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multi-objective Asynchronous Successive Halving\n\n*From Search Query: real-world performance metrics language models*\n\n*C\u00e9dric Archambeau, David Salinas, Muhammad Bilal Zafar, Michele Donini, Robin Schmucker*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is increasingly used to automatically tune the predictive performance (e.g., accuracy) of machine learning models. However, in a plethora of real-world applications, accuracy is only one of the multiple -- often conflicting -- performance criteria, necessitating the adoption of a multi-objective (MO) perspective. While the literature on MO optimization is rich, few prior studies have focused on HPO. In this paper, we propose algorithms that extend asynchronous successive halving (ASHA) to the MO setting. Considering multiple evaluation metrics, we assess the performance of these methods on three real world tasks: (i) Neural architecture search, (ii) algorithmic fairness and (iii) language model optimization. Our empirical analysis shows that MO ASHA enables to perform MO HPO at scale. Further, we observe that that taking the entire Pareto front into account for candidate selection consistently outperforms multi-fidelity HPO based on MO scalarization in terms of wall-clock time. Our algorithms (to be open-sourced) establish new baselines for future research in the area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Understanding INT4 Quantization for Transformer Models: Latency Speedup, Composability, and Failure Cases\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization case studies*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Zhewei Yao, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Cheng Li, Xiaoxia Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the deployment efficiency of transformer-based language models has been challenging given their high computation and memory cost. While INT8 quantization has recently been shown to be effective in reducing both the memory cost and latency while preserving model accuracy, it remains unclear whether we can leverage INT4 (which doubles peak hardware throughput) to achieve further latency improvement. In this study, we explore the feasibility of employing INT4 weight and activation (W4A4) quantization for language models. Our findings indicate that W4A4 quantization introduces no to negligible accuracy degradation for encoder-only and encoder-decoder models, but causes a significant accuracy drop for decoder-only models. To materialize the performance gain using W4A4, we develop a highly optimized end-to-end W4A4 encoder inference pipeline supporting different quantization strategies. Our INT4 pipeline is $8.5\\times$ faster for latency-oriented scenarios and up to $3\\times$ for throughput-oriented scenarios compared to the inference of FP16, and improves the SOTA BERT INT8 performance from FasterTransformer by up to $1.7\\times$. We provide insights into the failure cases when applying W4A4 to decoder-only models, and further explore the compatibility of INT4 quantization with other compression methods, like pruning and layer reduction.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. Pareto-Optimal Quantized ResNet Is Mostly 4-bit\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization case studies*\n\n*Lukasz Lew, Chas Leichner, Oleg Rybakov, Jonathan Malmaud, Shivani Agrawal, Lisa Wang, Amirali Abdolrashidi*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization has become a popular technique to compress neural networks and reduce compute cost, but most prior work focuses on studying quantization without changing the network size. Many real-world applications of neural networks have compute cost and memory budgets, which can be traded off with model quality by changing the number of parameters. In this work, we use ResNet as a case study to systematically investigate the effects of quantization on inference compute cost-quality tradeoff curves. Our results suggest that for each bfloat16 ResNet model, there are quantized models with lower cost and higher accuracy; in other words, the bfloat16 compute cost-quality tradeoff curve is Pareto-dominated by the 4-bit and 8-bit curves, with models primarily quantized to 4-bit yielding the best Pareto curve. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet for 4-bit ResNet-50 with quantization-aware training, obtaining a top-1 eval accuracy of 77.09%. We demonstrate the regularizing effect of quantization by measuring the generalization gap. The quantization method we used is optimized for practicality: It requires little tuning and is designed with hardware capabilities in mind. Our work motivates further research into optimal numeric formats for quantization, as well as the development of machine learning accelerators supporting these formats. As part of this work, we contribute a quantization library written in JAX, which is open-sourced at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/aqt.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on the implementation details of scan operations in production systems and performance metrics for hardware-optimized language models, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Implementation Details of Scan Operations\n\n### Parallel Scan Operations\nIn the context of language models, parallel scan operations can significantly enhance performance. For instance, the Mamba paper mentions that \"parallel scan computes the linear recurrence in O(log L) sequential steps,\" which highlights the efficiency of parallelizing scan operations. This approach can be implemented by dividing the data into segments and processing them in parallel, similar to the method described in the AWS DynamoDB documentation for parallel scans, where multiple workers scan different segments of the data simultaneously.\n\n### IO-Aware Block Processing\nIO-aware algorithms are crucial for optimizing hardware utilization. The BASED paper demonstrates this by showing that IO-aware optimizations can achieve 24x higher throughput on language generation tasks compared to other methods. This involves optimizing memory access patterns and reducing the number of memory transfers, which is essential for efficient block-based processing.\n\n### Memory Management and Access Patterns\nEfficient memory management is vital for scan-based operations. This includes optimizing state updates through structured operations, careful block boundary handling, and ensuring optimized memory access patterns. The FlexGen paper highlights the importance of flexible resource management, aggregating memory and computation from various hardware components to achieve high throughput.\n\n## Performance Metrics for Hardware-Optimized Language Models\n\n### Throughput and Efficiency\nStudies like the one by Sheng et al. (FlexGen) show that hardware-optimized models can achieve high throughput. For example, FlexGen can be configured to aggregate resources from GPUs, CPUs, and disks, leading to significant improvements in generative inference tasks.\n\n### Block Size Optimization\nOptimizing block size is critical for performance. The Mamba paper and other studies emphasize the importance of block size in reducing memory overhead and improving parallel processing efficiency. Proper block size optimization can lead to better state synchronization between blocks and more efficient memory access patterns.\n\n### Real-World Performance Metrics\nReal-world performance metrics often involve measuring throughput, latency, and memory usage. For instance, the BASED paper provides metrics on how IO-aware optimizations can improve throughput in language generation tasks. Similar metrics can be derived from other studies that focus on hardware-specific optimizations, such as the Elixir paper, which discusses training large language models on small GPU clusters and provides insights into performance and efficiency.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Case Studies\n\n### GPU and CPU Resource Management\nCase studies like FlexGen and Elixir provide detailed insights into how to manage resources from GPUs, CPUs, and disks to optimize performance. These studies show how flexible resource management can lead to high-throughput generative inference and efficient training of large language models.\n\n### Memory Access and State Updates\nThe Mamba and BASED papers offer case studies on optimizing memory access patterns and state updates. These studies demonstrate how careful optimization of these aspects can lead to significant performance improvements in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can gather comprehensive information to improve the design of autoregressive language models, ensuring better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

The scalar SSM scan is defined as computing the recurrent part of the discrete SSM (7), in the case when $N=1$ (i.e. $A$ is a scalar). This is commonly used to compute SSMs recurrently; in particular, the case of structured SSMs where $A$ is diagonally structured reduces down to this operation, such as in the S5 (J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and S6 (Gu and Dao 2023) models. The goal of this section is to support a central theme of this paper that efficient algorithms for sequence models can be viewed as structured matrix multiplication algorithms. The various matrix decomposition ideas we show here are related to ideas used to derive fast SSM algorithms (Section 6), as well as directly used as a subroutine. ## B. 1 Problem Definition\n\nLet $a:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) and $b:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) be sequences of scalars. The scalar SSM scan is defined as\n\n$$\nh_{t}=a_{t} h_{t-1}+b_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $h_{-1}$ can be an arbitrary value representing the previous hidden state to the SSM recurrence; unless otherwise specified, we assume $h_{-1}=0$. We also call equation (21) the cumprodsum (cumulative product sum). Note that the cumprodsum reduces to the cumprod (cumulative product) when $b=0$ is the additive identity and it reduces to the cumsum (cumulative sum) when $a=1$ is the multiplicative identity. Finally, note that in vectorized form we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh & =M b \\\\\nM & =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & & & & \\\\\na_{1} & 1 & & & \\\\\na_{2} a_{1} & a_{2} & 1 & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\na_{T-1} \\ldots a_{1} & a_{T-1} \\ldots a_{2} & \\ldots & a_{T-1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, this is simply the matrix-vector product by a 1-SS matrix $M$. Therefore we have three ways of viewing this fundamental primitive operation that are all equivalent:\n\n- A (scalar) SSM scan. - A cumprodsum. - A 1-SS matrix-vector multiplication . ## B. 2 Classical Algorithms\n\nWe first describe the two classical ways of computing the SSM scan (21), previously used by prior work. ## B.2.1 Sequential Recurrence\n\nThe recurrent mode simply computes (21) one timestep $t$ at a time. From the perspective of 1-SS multiplication, this was also described in Section 3.4.1. ## B.2.2 Parallel Associative Scan\n\nSecond, an important observation is that this recurrence can be turned into an associative scan (E.\n```\n\n#### 2. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models. Code for this work is provided at: https://github.com/HazyResearch/based.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/72 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nNote that register memory is private to an executing thread, so threads need to write to shared memory to communicate data to other threads in the block. To reduce the time required for reads and writes, a key principle is to fuse multiple operations on the same data slice while it's in fast memory before writing it back to slow memory. ### 5.1 Taylor Exponential Linear Attention\n\nDespite the theoretically improved complexity, the linear attention methods demonstrated in prior work are often less efficient than highly-optimized softmax attention implementations (Flash Attention [12]) when measured in real-world wall-clock time and memory usage. We next present hardware-aware algorithms to make Taylor linear attention efficient. We focus on two operations: (1) prefill, corresponding to processing the prompt during generation or the forward pass during training, and (2) next token prediction during generation, which also requires updating the recurrent hidden state state. In this section, we refer to the batch size as $B$, number of heads as $H$, head dimension as $d$, sequence length as $N$ and feature dimension as $d^{\\prime}$, following Section 4 . For ease of notation, let $D=1+d^{\\prime}+d^{\\prime 2}$ in this section. Additional details for the IO-Aware algorithms are included in Appendix B. ### 5.1.1 Forward Pass / Generation Prefill\n\nBaseline Implementation The na\u00efve implementation detailed in Appendix B (1) produces the feature maps $Q, K,(2)$ computes and materializes the large hidden state $K V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times d \\times D}$, then (3) computes the causal dot product between $Q$ and $K V$. Prior work has released popular CUDA kernels for linear attention to efficiently perform the causal dot product / step (3) 34. The kernel parallelizes computation across the heads and batches, loads tiles of $V$ and $K$ to SRAM, updates the running $K V$ state in SRAM, loads tiles of $Q$ to SRAM, produces the final output in SRAM, and writes the result to HBM. Analysis In overall IO cost, ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, this procedure requires $2 B H N D$ bytes for writing featurized $Q, K$ to HBM. During the causal dot product, this requires $2 B H N D+B H N d$ bytes to read $Q, K, V$ tiles and $B H N d$ bytes to write the result. Throughout the computation, $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes (note this is the shape $K V$ state during the forward pass) are read in and out of thread registers to SRAM to update the running output and $K V$ state at $19 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth. Algorithm To improve efficiency, our algorithm computes both the feature map and the causal dot product in fast memory. Our overall algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1 and we discuss the overall process here. The algorithm first parallelizes over the batch $B$ and head $H$ dimensions, since computation is independent for each head in each batch. We consider the three terms $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ in the linear attention output, corresponding to the three terms in the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor polynomial for the exponential. We also consider the corresponding three terms, in the cumulative $K V$ state as we process a sequence. For a given tile (i.e. sub-matrix) of $Q, K, V$, we load the tiles (e.g., tile of $Q, K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 16}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 64}$ given 16 tokens, 16 feature dimension, and 64 head dimension) into fast memory and update the running $K V$ state and output for each of the three terms. We load the tiles into the register file and fuse-operations to compute the causal dot product in register, only writing to SRAM to synchronize the cumulative $K V$ state across parallel warps. We use explicit writes to SRAM for this synchronization because register memory is warp-specific (threads in one warp do not access the registers for a thread in a different warp). Analysis In IO cost, again ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, our procedure requires $2 B H N d^{\\prime}$ bytes for reading $q, k$ and $2 B H N d$ bytes for reading $v$ and writing output $y$ between HBM and SRAM. Overall, our algorithm avoids in HBM $\\mathcal{O}(2 B H N D)$ bytes in HBM to SRAM data movement. We additionally improve upon the baseline by performing computation in-register to avoid the $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes in SRAM to register data movement. ### 5.1.2 Next token prediction\n\nDuring next token prediction, an important consideration is how to efficiently update the recurrent state $K V_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D d}$ at timestep $t$. The expensive operation during next token prediction is computing the outer product between projected hidden states $k_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D}$ and $v_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H d}$. The outer product requires $\\mathcal{O}(B H D d)$ computation and space, and the result is summed with $K V_{t}$ to produce $K V_{t+1}$. We provide an IO-aware algorithm for the state updates in Algorithm 2. This algorithm incurs $\\mathcal{O}(B H D+B H d)$ bytes of HBM to SRAM data movement (to load the $q, k, v$ projections). ## 5.2 tcWindow\n\nNext we motivate the choice of window size for TCWINDOW. In contrast to sliding-window style models such as the popular Mistral models, which use large window sizes $w=4096$ [10], BASED chooses a window size based on hardware specifications. GPU tensor cores operate on $16 \\times 16$ tiles. Large GEMMs are compute bound (for e.g. in long-context attention). But, we need sufficient occupancy to hide the latency of the tensor core units. Figure 1 (Right) shows $64 \\times 64$ dimension matrix multiplications are approximately the same latency as $16 \\times 16$. BASED sets $w$ to use $64 \\times 64$ tiles (Figure 1). To distinguish from prior sliding windows, we refer to this approach as TCWindow. We use the Flash Attention sliding window implementation during training [11] and in Appendix B Algorithm 3, we provide an IO-aware algorithm of TCWindow for next token prediction. End-to-end benchmarks for BASED implemented with these IO-aware algorithms are provided in Section 6 . Micro-benchmarks for each kernel against the baseline implementations are provided in Appendix B. ## 6 Results\n\nIn this section, we present results for the following claims:\n\n1. Language modeling overall. We evaluate architectures in pretraining from scratch on the Pile 330] and on standard benchmarks from the LM Eval Harness [16. We find BASED matches or outperforms the strongest sub-quadratic architectures (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/15 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nThe parallel-scan computation outlined in section 3.2 was used for all experiments.

This bias is evident when plotting the (centered) stable-exponential amplitude activation function. In contrast, the sigmoid function does not have this bias.

Because the imaginary part of an individual state transition is not strictly required to be restricted to a specific interval, we omit the phase activation.

Learning to Recombine and Resample Data for Compositional Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: scan based sequence processing*\n\n*Ekin Aky\u00fcrek, Afra Feyza Aky\u00fcrek, Jacob Andreas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a family of learned data augmentation schemes that support a large category of compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure in settings requiring Compositional generalization beyond the training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Flexible neural models outperform grammar- and automaton-based counterparts on a variety of sequence modeling tasks. However, neural models perform poorly in settings requiring compositional generalization beyond the training data -- particularly to rare or unseen subsequences. Past work has found symbolic scaffolding (e.g. grammars or automata) essential in these settings. Here we present a family of learned data augmentation schemes that support a large category of compositional generalizations without appeal to latent symbolic structure. Our approach to data augmentation has two components: recombination of original training examples via a prototype-based generative model and resampling of generated examples to encourage extrapolation. Training an ordinary neural sequence model on a dataset augmented with recombined and resampled examples significantly improves generalization in two language processing problems---instruction following (SCAN) and morphological analysis (Sigmorphon 2018)---where our approach enables learning of new constructions and tenses from as few as eight initial examples.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Mutual Exclusivity Training and Primitive Augmentation to Induce Compositionality\n\n*From Search Query: scan based sequence processing*\n\n*Yichen Jiang, Xiang Zhou, Mohit Bansal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two techniques to address a lack of mutual exclusivity bias and the tendency to memorize whole examples rather than separating structures from contents in standard sequence-to-sequence models: Mutual Exclusivity Training and prim2primX data augmentation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent datasets expose the lack of the systematic generalization ability in standard sequence-to-sequence models. In this work, we analyze this behavior of seq2seq models and identify two contributing factors: a lack of mutual exclusivity bias (one target sequence can only be mapped to one source sequence), and the tendency to memorize whole examples rather than separating structures from contents. We propose two techniques to address these two issues respectively: Mutual Exclusivity Training that prevents the model from producing seen generations when facing novel examples via an unlikelihood-based loss, and prim2primX data augmentation that automatically diversifies the arguments of every syntactic function to prevent memorizing and provide a compositional inductive bias without exposing test-set data. Combining these two techniques, we show substantial empirical improvements using standard sequence-to-sequence models (LSTMs and Transformers) on two widely-used compositionality datasets: SCAN and COGS. Finally, we provide analysis characterizing the improvements as well as the remaining challenges, and provide detailed ablations of our method.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Chunk, Align, Select: A Simple Long-sequence Processing Method for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: scan based sequence processing*\n\n*Jiawen Xie, Pengyu Cheng, Xiao Liang, Yong Dai, Nan Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths.\n\n**Abstract:** Although dominant in natural language processing, transformer-based models remain challenged by the task of long-sequence processing, because the computational cost of self-attention operations in transformers swells quadratically with the input sequence length. To alleviate the complexity of long-sequence processing, we propose a simple framework to enable the offthe-shelf pre-trained transformers to process much longer sequences, while the computation and memory costs remain growing linearly with the input sequence lengths. More specifically, our method divides each long-sequence input into a batch of chunks, then aligns the interchunk information during the encoding steps, and finally selects the most representative hidden states from the encoder for the decoding process. To extract inter-chunk semantic information, we align the start and end token embeddings among chunks in each encoding transformer block. To learn an effective hidden selection policy, we design a dual updating scheme inspired by reinforcement learning, which regards the decoders of transformers as environments, and the downstream performance metrics as the rewards to evaluate the hidden selection actions. Our empirical results on real-world long-text summarization and reading comprehension tasks demonstrate effective improvements compared to prior longsequence processing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Streaming Algorithms for Support-Aware Histograms\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms*\n\n*Justin Y. Chen, P. Indyk, Tal Wagner*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms that compute near-optimal histograms in sub-linear space and presents lower bounds on the space complexity of this problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Histograms, i.e., piece-wise constant approximations, are a popular tool used to represent data distributions. Traditionally, the difference between the histogram and the underlying distribution (i.e., the approximation error) is measured using the L p norm, which sums the differences between the two functions over all items in the domain. Although useful in many applications, the drawback of this error measure is that it treats approximation errors of all items in the same way, irrespec-tive of whether the mass of an item is important for the downstream application that uses the approximation. As a result, even relatively simple distributions cannot be approximated by succinct histograms without incurring large error. In this paper, we address this issue by adapting the de\ufb01nition of approximation so that only the errors of the items that belong to the support of the distribution are considered. Under this de\ufb01nition, we develop ef\ufb01cient 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms that compute near-optimal histograms in sub-linear space. We also present lower bounds on the space complexity of this problem. Surpris-ingly, under this notion of error, there is an exponential gap in the space complexity of 1-pass and 2-pass streaming algorithms. Finally, we demon-strate the utility of our algorithms on a collection of real and synthetic data sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Overcoming Oscillations in Quantization-Aware Training\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms*\n\n*Markus Nagel, Marios Fournarakis, Yelysei Bondarenko, Tijmen Blankevoort*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper delves deeper into the phenomenon of weight oscillations and shows that it can lead to a significant accuracy degradation due to wrongly estimated batch-normalization statistics during inference and increased noise during training.\n\n**Abstract:** When training neural networks with simulated quantization, we observe that quantized weights can, rather unexpectedly, oscillate between two grid-points. The importance of this effect and its impact on quantization-aware training (QAT) are not well-understood or investigated in literature. In this paper, we delve deeper into the phenomenon of weight oscillations and show that it can lead to a significant accuracy degradation due to wrongly estimated batch-normalization statistics during inference and increased noise during training. These effects are particularly pronounced in low-bit ($\\leq$ 4-bits) quantization of efficient networks with depth-wise separable layers, such as MobileNets and EfficientNets. In our analysis we investigate several previously proposed QAT algorithms and show that most of these are unable to overcome oscillations. Finally, we propose two novel QAT algorithms to overcome oscillations during training: oscillation dampening and iterative weight freezing. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for low-bit (3&4 bits) weight and activation quantization of efficient architectures, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, and EfficentNet-lite on ImageNet.

Our main contribution is the derivation of continuous-time models (in the form of SDEs) for SAM and two of its variants, both for the full-batch and mini-batch settings. We demonstrate that these SDEs are rigorous approximations of the real discrete-time algorithms (in a weak sense, scaling linearly with the learning rate). Using these models, we then offer an explanation of why SAM prefers flat minima over sharp ones~--~by showing that it minimizes an implicitly regularized loss with a Hessian-dependent noise structure. Finally, we prove that SAM is attracted to saddle points under some realistic conditions.

In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 309  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SuMa++: Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM\n\n*From Search Query: scan based sequence processing*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Reliable and accurate localization and mapping are key components of most autonomous systems. Besides geometric information about the mapped environment, the semantics plays an important role to enable intelligent navigation behaviors. In most realistic environments, this task is particularly complicated due to dynamics caused by moving objects, which can corrupt the mapping step or derail localization. In this paper, we propose an extension of a recently published surfel-based mapping approach exploiting three-dimensional laser range scans by integrating semantic information to facilitate the mapping process. The semantic information is efficiently extracted by a fully convolutional neural network and rendered on a spherical projection of the laser range data. This computed semantic segmentation results in point-wise labels for the whole scan, allowing us to build a semantically-enriched map with labeled surfels. This semantic map enables us to reliably filter moving objects, but also improve the projective scan matching via semantic constraints. Our experimental evaluation on challenging highways sequences from KITTI dataset with very few static structures and a large amount of moving cars shows the advantage of our semantic SLAM approach in comparison to a purely geometric, state-of-the-art approach.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. End-to-End Attention-based Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: scan based sequence processing*\n\n*Philemon Brakel, Jan Chorowski, Yoshua Bengio, Dmitriy Serdyuk, Dzmitry Bahdanau*\n\n**Abstract:** Many of the current state-of-the-art Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech\nRecognition Systems (LVCSR) are hybrids of neural networks and Hidden Markov\nModels (HMMs). Most of these systems contain separate components that deal with\nthe acoustic modelling, language modelling and sequence decoding. We\ninvestigate a more direct approach in which the HMM is replaced with a\nRecurrent Neural Network (RNN) that performs sequence prediction directly at\nthe character level. Alignment between the input features and the desired\ncharacter sequence is learned automatically by an attention mechanism built\ninto the RNN. For each predicted character, the attention mechanism scans the\ninput sequence and chooses relevant frames. We propose two methods to speed up\nthis operation: limiting the scan to a subset of most promising frames and\npooling over time the information contained in neighboring frames, thereby\nreducing source sequence length.

BurstAttention: An Efficient Distributed Attention Framework for Extremely Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms*\n\n*Ao Sun, Maosong Sun, Chuan Shi, Zhiyuan Liu, Cheng Yang, Xu Han, Weilin Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Effective attention modules have played a crucial role in the success of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but the quadratic time and memory complexities of these attention modules also pose a challenge when processing long sequences. One potential solution for the long sequence problem is to utilize distributed clusters to parallelize the computation of attention modules across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs). However, adopting a distributed approach inevitably introduces extra memory overheads to store local attention results and incurs additional communication costs to aggregate local results into global ones. In this paper, we propose a distributed attention framework named ``BurstAttention'' to optimize memory access and communication operations at both the global cluster and local device levels. In our experiments, we compare BurstAttention with other competitive distributed attention solutions for long sequence processing. The experimental results under different length settings demonstrate that BurstAttention offers significant advantages for processing long sequences compared with these competitive baselines, reducing 40% communication overheads and achieving 1.37 X speedup during training 128K sequence length on 32 X A100.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient transformers*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient transformers*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Hanrui Wang, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Ligeng Zhu, Han Cai, Chuang Gan*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with $\\textit{arbitrary encoder-decoder attention}$ and $\\textit{heterogeneous layers}$. Then we train a $\\textit{SuperTransformer}$ that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many $\\textit{SubTransformers}$ with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized $\\textit{SubTransformer}$ dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT'14 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve $\\textbf{3}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.7}\\times$ smaller size over baseline Transformer; $\\textbf{2.7}\\times$ speedup, $\\textbf{3.6}\\times$ smaller size over Evolved Transformer with $\\textbf{12,041}\\times$ less search cost and no performance loss. HAT code is https://github.com/mit-han-lab/hardware-aware-transformers.git\n\n**Conference:** hat-hardware-aware-transformers-for-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on scan-based sequence processing, IO-aware algorithms, and hardware-efficient transformations, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Scan-Based Sequence Processing\n\n### Parallel Scan Algorithm\nThe parallel scan algorithm is a significant advancement in sequence processing. By removing hidden state dependencies from traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs, these models can be trained efficiently using parallel scan, which avoids the need for backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n\n- **minLSTM and minGRU**: These minimal versions of LSTMs and GRUs are trainable via parallel scan, reducing computational complexity and speeding up training. This approach can be particularly beneficial for autoregressive models by enabling parallel computation of sequence dependencies.\n\n### FlashAttention and Partition-Attention\nFlashAttention is an IO-aware self-attention algorithm that optimizes memory usage and runtime for long sequences by minimizing read/write operations between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and SRAM. This is achieved by dividing input matrices into smaller blocks and fusing operations to reduce memory overhead.\n\n- **Partition-Attention**: This technique concatenates variable-length sequences into a single long chain without padding, using attention masks to preserve batch structure. This approach ensures consistent computational load across batches, enhancing GPU utilization and model inference performance.\n\n## IO-Aware Algorithms\n\n### FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is designed to optimize attention computations by reducing the memory footprint and improving runtime. It does this by:\n- Dividing input key, query, and value matrices into smaller blocks.\n- Loading only necessary blocks into SRAM.\n- Minimizing read/write operations between HBM and SRAM.\n\n### Efficient Inference and Training\nThe combination of FlashAttention and Partition-Attention can handle up to 100,000 tokens without memory errors, achieving a 16-fold reduction in inference time and an 8-fold reduction in memory usage. This makes it highly suitable for large-scale protein language models and potentially other autoregressive models.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques\n\n### Memory Management and Block Processing\nThe use of block-based processing and double buffering techniques can significantly optimize memory access patterns for modern hardware architectures. For example:\n- **LSH-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT)**: This model uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and integrates local inductive bias, achieving near-linear complexity with hardware-friendly operations. It also supports fixed-point numbers and bit-accurate softmax and multi-head attention layers, which are optimized for JIT compilation on TensorFlow and JAX backends.\n\n### GPU Utilization\nOptimizing models for GPU utilization is crucial. Techniques like FlashAttention and Partition-Attention ensure full GPU utilization by managing batch sizes based on token count rather than the number of sequences. This approach maximizes GPU efficiency and reduces memory overhead.\n\n### Specialized Hardware-Efficient Methods\nModels like Mamba propose specialized hardware-efficient methods that leverage the GPU's memory hierarchy to reduce high I/O costs and speed up training.

The scalar SSM scan is defined as computing the recurrent part of the discrete SSM (7), in the case when $N=1$ (i.e. $A$ is a scalar). This is commonly used to compute SSMs recurrently; in particular, the case of structured SSMs where $A$ is diagonally structured reduces down to this operation, such as in the S5 (J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and S6 (Gu and Dao 2023) models. The goal of this section is to support a central theme of this paper that efficient algorithms for sequence models can be viewed as structured matrix multiplication algorithms. The various matrix decomposition ideas we show here are related to ideas used to derive fast SSM algorithms (Section 6), as well as directly used as a subroutine. ## B. 1 Problem Definition\n\nLet $a:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) and $b:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) be sequences of scalars. The scalar SSM scan is defined as\n\n$$\nh_{t}=a_{t} h_{t-1}+b_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $h_{-1}$ can be an arbitrary value representing the previous hidden state to the SSM recurrence; unless otherwise specified, we assume $h_{-1}=0$. We also call equation (21) the cumprodsum (cumulative product sum). Note that the cumprodsum reduces to the cumprod (cumulative product) when $b=0$ is the additive identity and it reduces to the cumsum (cumulative sum) when $a=1$ is the multiplicative identity. Finally, note that in vectorized form we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh & =M b \\\\\nM & =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & & & & \\\\\na_{1} & 1 & & & \\\\\na_{2} a_{1} & a_{2} & 1 & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\na_{T-1} \\ldots a_{1} & a_{T-1} \\ldots a_{2} & \\ldots & a_{T-1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, this is simply the matrix-vector product by a 1-SS matrix $M$. Therefore we have three ways of viewing this fundamental primitive operation that are all equivalent:\n\n- A (scalar) SSM scan. - A cumprodsum. - A 1-SS matrix-vector multiplication . ## B. 2 Classical Algorithms\n\nWe first describe the two classical ways of computing the SSM scan (21), previously used by prior work. ## B.2.1 Sequential Recurrence\n\nThe recurrent mode simply computes (21) one timestep $t$ at a time. From the perspective of 1-SS multiplication, this was also described in Section 3.4.1. ## B.2.2 Parallel Associative Scan\n\nSecond, an important observation is that this recurrence can be turned into an associative scan (E.\n```\n\n#### 2.

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 53/53 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\n- Pendulum Regression: Reproduced from Becker et al.

The parallelization of scan operations has been well studied (Ladner \\& Fischer, 1980; Lakshmivarahan \\& Dhall, 1994; Blelloch, 1990), and many standard scientific computing libraries contain efficient implementations. We note the linear recurrence we consider here is a specific instance of the more general setting discussed in Section 1.4 of Blelloch (1990). Computing a general parallel scan requires defining two objects:\n\n- The initial elements the scan will operate on. - A binary associative operator $\\bullet$ used to combine the elements. To compute a length $L$ linear recurrence, $x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} x_{k}$, we will define the $L$ initial elements, $c_{1: L}$, such that each element $c_{k}$ is the tuple\n\n$$\nc_{k}=\\left(c_{k, a}, c_{k, b}\\right):=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nThese $c_{1: L}$ will be precomputed prior to the scan. Having created the list of elements for the scan to operate on, we define the binary operator $\\bullet$ for the scan to use on this linear recurrence as\n\n$$\nq_{i} \\bullet q_{j}:=\\left(q_{j, a} \\odot q_{i, a}, \\quad q_{j, a} \\otimes q_{i, b}+q_{j, b}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $q_{k}$ denotes an input element to the operator that could be the initial elements $c_{k}$ or some intermediate result, $\\odot$ denotes matrix-matrix multiplication, $\\otimes$ denotes matrix-vector multiplication and + denotes elementwise addition. We show that this operator is associative at the end of this section. Simple example using binary operator We can illustrate how $\\bullet$ can be used to compute a linear recurrence in parallel with a simple example. Consider the system $x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}$, and a length $L=4$ sequence of inputs $u_{1: 4}$. Assuming $x_{0}=0$, the desired latent states from this recurrence are:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{1}=\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1} \\\\\n& x_{2}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2} \\\\\n& x_{3}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3} \\\\\n& x_{4}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{3}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe first note that $\\bullet$ can be used to compute this recurrence sequentially. We can initialize the scan elements $c_{1: 4}$ as in (33), and then sequentially scan over these elements to compute the output elements $s_{i}=s_{i-1} \\bullet c_{i}$. Defining $s_{0}:=(\\mathbf{I}, 0)$ where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, we have for our example:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& s_{1}=s_{0} \\bullet c_{1}=(\\mathbf{I}, 0) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{I}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}} 0+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& s_{2}=s_{1} \\bullet c_{2}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right) \\\\\n& s_{3}=s_{2} \\bullet c_{3}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right) \\\\\n& s_{4}=s_{3} \\bullet c_{4}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{4}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{3}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right) \\text {. }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the second entry of each of the output tuples, $s_{i, b}$, contains the desired $x_{i}$ computed above. Computing the scan in this way requires four sequential steps since each $s_{i}$ depends on $s_{i-1}$. Now consider how we can use this binary operator to compute the recurrence in parallel. We will label the output elements of the parallel scan as $r_{1: 4}$ and define $r_{0}=(\\mathbf{I}, 0)$. We will first compute the even indexed elements $r_{2}$ and $r_{4}$, and then compute the odd indexed elements $r_{1}$ and $r_{3}$. We start by applying the binary operator $\\bullet$ to adjacent pairs of our initial elements $c_{1: 4}$ to compute $r_{2}$ and the\nintermediate result $q_{4}$, and we then repeat this process to compute $r_{4}$ by applying $\\bullet$ to $r_{2}$ and $q_{4}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{2}=c_{1} \\bullet c_{2} & =\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right) \\\\\nq_{4}=c_{3} \\bullet c_{4} & =\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{3}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right) \\\\\nr_{4}=r_{2} \\bullet q_{4} & =\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{3}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{4}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{3}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{4}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow we will compute the odd indexed elements $r_{1}$ and $r_{3}$, using the even indexed $r_{0}$ and $r_{2}$, as $r_{k}=r_{k-1} \\bullet c_{k}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& r_{1}=r_{0} \\bullet c_{1}=(I, 0) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}\\right) \\\\\n& r_{3}=r_{2} \\bullet c_{3}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{2}\\right) \\bullet\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right)=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{3}, \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}^{2} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{A B}} u_{2}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{3}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the second entry of each of the output tuples, $r_{k, b}$, corresponds to the desired $x_{k}$. Inspecting the required dependencies for each application of $\\bullet$, we see that $r_{2}$ and the intermediate result $q_{4}$ can be computed in parallel. Once $r_{2}$ and $q_{4}$ are computed, $r_{1}, r_{3}$ and $r_{4}$ can all be computed in parallel. We have therefore reduced the number of sequential steps required from four in the sequential scan version to two in the parallel scan version. This reduction in sequential steps becomes important when the sequence length is large since, given sufficient processors, the parallel time scales logarithmically with the sequence length. Associativity of binary operator Finally, for completeness, we show that the binary operator $\\bullet$ is associative:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(q_{i} \\bullet q_{j}\\right) \\bullet q_{k} & =\\left(q_{j, a} \\odot q_{i, a}, q_{j, a} \\otimes q_{i, b}+q_{j, b}\\right) \\bullet q_{k} \\\\\n& =\\left(q_{k, a} \\odot\\left(q_{j, a} \\odot q_{i, a}\\right), q_{k, a} \\otimes\\left(q_{j, a} \\otimes q_{i, b}+q_{j, b}\\right)+q_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\left(q_{k, a} \\odot q_{j, a}\\right) \\odot q_{i, a}, q_{k, a} \\otimes\\left(q_{j, a} \\otimes q_{i, b}\\right)+q_{k, a} \\otimes q_{j, b}+q_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\left(\\left(q_{k, a} \\odot q_{j, a}\\right) \\odot q_{i, a}, \\quad\\left(q_{k, a} \\odot q_{j, a}\\right) \\otimes q_{i, b}+q_{k, a} \\otimes q_{j, b}+q_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =q_{i} \\bullet\\left(q_{k, a} \\odot q_{j, a}, q_{k, a} \\otimes q_{j, b}+q_{k, b}\\right) \\\\\n& =q_{i} \\bullet\\left(q_{j} \\bullet q_{k}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The full S5 implementation is available at: https: / / github.com/lindermanlab/S5. \n```\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/44 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nPrior research emphasizes the significance of these choices in achieving high performance on challenging long-range tasks [19, 20, 56, 57]. Recent work [57] has studied these parameterizations/initializations in more detail and provides insight into this setup's favorable initial eigenvalue distributions and normalization effects. ### 2.3 Parallel Scans\n\nWe briefly introduce parallel scans, as used by S5, since they are important for parallelizing the ConvS5 method we introduce in Section 3. See Blelloch [63] for a more detailed review. A scan operation, given a binary associative operator $\\bullet($ i.e. $(a \\bullet b) \\bullet c=a \\bullet(b \\bullet c)$ ) and a sequence of $L$ elements $\\left[a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{L}\\right]$, yields the sequence: $\\left[a_{1},\\left(a_{1} \\bullet a_{2}\\right), \\ldots,\\left(a_{1} \\bullet a_{2} \\bullet \\ldots \\bullet a_{L}\\right)\\right]$. Parallel scans use the fact that associative operators can be computed in any order. A parallel scan can be defined for the linear recurrence of the state update in (4) by forming the initial scan tuples $c_{k}=\\left(c_{k, a}, c_{k, b}\\right):=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{u}_{k}\\right)$ and utilizing a binary associative operator that takes two tuples $q_{i}, q_{j}$ (either the initial tuples $c_{i}, c_{j}$ or intermediate tuples) and produces a new tuple of the same type, $q_{i} \\bullet q_{j}:=\\left(q_{j, a} \\odot q_{i, a}, q_{j, a} \\otimes q_{i, b}+q_{j, b}\\right)$, where $\\odot$ is matrix-matrix multiplication and $\\otimes$ is matrix-vector multiplication. Given sufficient processors, the parallel scan computes the linear recurrence of (4) in $O(\\log L)$ sequential steps (i.e., depth or span) [63]. ## 3 Method\n\nThis section introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSMs). We show how ConvSSMs can be parallelized with parallel scans. We then connect the dynamics of ConvSSMs to SSMs to motivate parameterization. Finally, we use these insights to introduce an efficient ConvSSM variant, ConvS5. ### 3.1 Convolutional State Space Models\n\nConsider a continuous tensor-valued input $\\mathcal{U}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H^{\\prime} \\times W^{\\prime} \\times U}$ with height $H^{\\prime}$, width $W^{\\prime}$, and number of input features $U$. We will define a continuous-time, linear convolutional state space model (ConvSSM) with state $\\mathcal{X}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times P}$, derivative $\\mathcal{X}^{\\prime}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times P}$ and output $\\mathcal{Y}(t) \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W \\times U}$, using a differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{X}^{\\prime}(t) & =\\mathcal{A} * \\mathcal{X}(t)+\\mathcal{B} * \\mathcal{U}(t) \\\\\n\\mathcal{Y}(t) & =\\mathcal{C} * \\mathcal{X}(t)+\\mathcal{D} * \\mathcal{U}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $*$ denotes the convolution operator, $\\mathcal{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P \\times P \\times k_{A} \\times k_{A}}$ is the state kernel, $\\mathcal{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P \\times U \\times k_{B} \\times k_{B}}$ is the input kernel, $\\mathcal{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{U \\times P \\times k_{C} \\times k_{C}}$ is the output kernel, and $\\mathcal{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{U \\times U \\times k_{D} \\times k_{D}}$ is the feedthrough kernel. For simplicity, we pad the convolution to ensure the same spatial resolution, $H \\times W$, is maintained in the states and outputs. Similarly, given a sequence of $L$ inputs, $\\mathcal{U}_{1: L} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times H^{\\prime} \\times W^{\\prime} \\times U}$, we define a discrete-time convolutional state space model as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathcal{X}_{k}=\\overline{\\mathcal{A}} * \\mathcal{X}_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathcal{B}} * \\mathcal{U}_{k} \\\\\n& \\mathcal{Y}_{k}=\\mathcal{C} * \\mathcal{X}_{k}+\\mathcal{D} * \\mathcal{U}_{k}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\overline{\\mathcal{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P \\times P \\times k_{A} \\times k_{A}}$ and $\\overline{\\mathcal{B}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P \\times U \\times k_{B} \\times k_{B}}$ denote that these kernels are in discrete-time. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_d6faac708d10b5b87bdcg-05.jpg?height=437&width=841&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=639)\n\nFigure 2: The dynamics of a ConvSSM with pointwise state kernel (top) can be equivalently viewed as the dynamics of an SSM (bottom). See Proposition 3. Each ConvSSM state pixel evolves according to an SSM state update with shared state matrix, $\\mathbf{A}_{\\mathrm{SSM}}$, and input matrix, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\mathrm{SSM}}$, that can be formed by reshaping the ConvSSM's state kernel and input kernel. This allows leveraging parameterization insights from deep SSMs [19, 41, 42, 20, 57] to equip ConvS5 to model long-range dependencies. ### 3.2 Parallelizing Convolutional Recurrences\n\nConvS5 leverages parallel scans to efficiently parallelize the recurrence in (7). As discussed in Section 2.3, this requires a binary associative operator. Given that convolutions are associative, we show:\n\nProposition 1. Consider a convolutional recurrence as in (7) and define initial parallel scan elements $c_{k}=\\left(c_{k, a}, c_{k, b}\\right):=\\left(\\overline{\\mathcal{A}}, \\overline{\\mathcal{B}} * \\mathcal{U}_{k}\\right)$. The binary operator $\\circledast$, defined below, is associative. $$\nq_{i} \\circledast q_{j}:=\\left(q_{j, a} \\circ q_{i, a}, q_{j, a} * q_{i, b}+q_{j, b}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes convolution of two kernels, $*$ denotes convolution and + is elementwise addition. ## Proof. See Appendix A.1. Therefore, in theory, we can use this binary operator with a parallel scan to compute the recurrence in (7). However, the binary operator, $\\circledast$, requires convolving two $k_{A} \\times k_{A}$ resolution state kernels together. To maintain equivalence with the sequential scan, the resulting kernel will have resolution $2 k_{a}-1 \\times 2 k_{a}-1$. This implies that the state kernel will grow during the parallel scan computations for general kernels with a resolution greater than $1 \\times 1$. This allows the receptive field to grow in the time direction, a useful feature for capturing spatiotemporal context. However, this kernel growth is computationally infeasible for long sequences. We address this challenge by taking further inspiration from deep SSMs. These methods opt for simple but computationally advantageous operations in the time direction (linear dynamics) and utilize more complex operations (nonlinear activations) in the depth direction of the model. These nonlinear activations allow a stack of SSM layers with linear dynamics to represent nonlinear systems. Analogously, we choose to use $1 \\times 1$ state kernels and perform pointwise state convolutions for the convolutional recurrence of (7). When we stack multiple layers of these ConvSSMs, the receptive field grows in the depth direction of the network and allows the stack of layers to capture the spatiotemporal context [64].\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/20 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nHowever, some of these tasks encounter issues with inadequate performance. Moreover, frequent sequential scans can compromise the efficiency of the model. ## 3 Linear Recurrence in Multi-dimensional Space\n\nIn this section, we discuss the theoretical and practical computational complexity of linear recurrence (with decay) when dealing with high-dimensional data, and then analyze the types of linear recurrence. In subsequent discussions, we assume $n$ is the sequence length, $d$ is the embedding dimension, and $\\mathbf{x}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the transpose of the $t$-th row of matrix $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. ### 3.1 Computational Complexity of Linear Recurrence\n\nIt has been proved that all linear attention, state space model, and linear RNN can be expressed using a linear recurrence formula [29]. We use linear attention with decay [2,3] as an example. Below is the recursive form (i.e. a scan):\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{0}=\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{t}=\\lambda_{t} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{k}_{t} \\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top}, \\mathbf{o}_{t}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{q}_{t}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathbf{t}}, t=1, \\ldots, n\n$$\n\nHere, $0<\\lambda_{t} \\leq 1$ is the decay rate. Note that the above formula is for the causal scenario. When dealing with non-causal scenarios, a common practice in the literature is to perform causal computation twice [5, 6]. We call this method \" 2 scan\":\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{k v}}_{0}=\\mathbf{0}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{k v}}_{t}=\\lambda_{t} \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{k v}}_{t-1}+\\mathbf{k}_{t} \\mathbf{v}_{t}^{\\top}, \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{o}}_{t}^{\\top}=\\mathbf{q}_{t}^{\\top} \\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{k v}}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{o}_{t}=\\overrightarrow{\\mathbf{o}}_{t}+\\overleftarrow{\\mathbf{o}}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ca5728fe5a821d021816g-03.jpg?height=68&width=752&top_left_y=1858&top_left_x=681)\n\nWhen $\\lambda_{t}=1$, i.e. there is no decay, the right product trick [9] can be used in this case. We call this method \" 1 scan\". $$\n[\\mathbf{K V}]=\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{O}=\\mathbf{Q}[\\mathbf{K V}]\n$$\n\nAlthough both of the above formulas have a time complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the \" 2 scan\" version is significantly slower than the \" 1 scan\" version. This is because causal computation requires block-level recursion [12,30], whereas the second formula can be fully parallelized due to matrix multiplication [9]. We provide a speed comparison in Fig. 1, where the \"2 scan\" is implemented with Lightning Attention [30], the fastest linear attention implementation so far. It can be seen that the \" 2 scan\" is several times slower than the \" 1 scan\" in both forward and backward passes. It is apparent that the need for multiple scans is mainly due to the presence of decay $\\lambda_{t}$. However, directly removing $\\lambda_{t}$ would lead to degraded performance [4]. A natural question arises: can we retain $\\lambda_{t}$ while only performing a single scan? In the next section, we will discuss the types of linear recurrence and answer the question. ### 3.2 Types of Linear Recurrence\n\nWe first explore the representation range of linear recurrences by 1D linear recurrence:\n\n$$\ny_{t}=a_{t} y_{t-1}+x_{t}, y_{0}=0\n$$\n\nUnroll the recursion equation of E.q 1, we obtain:\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} \\frac{A_{s}}{A_{t}} x_{s} \\triangleq \\sum_{s=1}^{t} c_{t s} x_{s}, A_{t}=\\left(\\prod_{s=1}^{t} a_{s}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe detailed proof of the unrolling process can be found in Appendix A.1. Note that $y_{t}$ is a linear combination of $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. A natural question arises: Can every linear combination $\\sum_{s=1}^{t} c_{t s} x_{s}$ be represented as a linear recursion? We now prove that a linear recursion representation is possible only when the coefficients $c_{t s}$ satisfy certain conditions. Theorem 3.1. A linear recurrence $y_{t}=a_{t} y_{t-1}+x_{t}, y_{0}=0$ is equivalent to a linear combination $y_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} c_{t s} x_{s}$, iff $c_{t s}=\\frac{g(s)}{g(t)}$, where $g(\\cdot)$ is a function. Proof of Theorem 3.1. $\\Rightarrow$\nGiven a linear recurrence, we multiply it by $A_{t}=\\left(\\prod_{s=1}^{t} a_{s}\\right)^{-1}$ and the following recurrence equation:\n\n$$\nA_{t} y_{t}=A_{t} a_{t} y_{t-1}+A_{t} x_{t}=A_{t-1} y_{t-1}+A_{t} x_{t}\n$$\n\nUnroll it, we get:\n\n$$\nA_{t} y_{t}-A_{t-1} y_{t-1}=A_{t} x_{t}, \\ldots, A_{2} y_{2}-A_{1} y_{1}=A_{2} x_{2}\n$$\n\nTo derive an expression for $y_{t}$, we sum the recursive equations and obtain:\n\n$$\nA_{t} y_{t}-A_{1} y_{1}=\\sum_{s=2}^{t} A_{s} c x_{s}, y_{t} A_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} A_{s} x_{s}, y_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} \\frac{A_{s}}{A_{t}} x_{s}\n$$\n\nBy comparing the coefficients, we can obtain $c_{t s}=A_{s} / A_{t}$. $\\Leftarrow:$\nGiven the linear combination $y_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t} c_{t s} x_{s}$ and $c_{t s}=\\frac{g(s)}{g(t)}$, we define $a_{t} \\triangleq \\frac{g(t-1)}{g(t)}$. Then $y_{t}$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{t} & =\\sum_{s=1}^{t} c_{t s} x_{s}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t-1} c_{t s} x_{s}+c_{t t} x_{t}=\\sum_{s=1}^{t-1} \\frac{g(s)}{g(t)} x_{s}+\\frac{g(t)}{g(t)} x_{t} \\\\\n& =\\frac{g(t-1)}{g(t)} \\sum_{s=1}^{t-1} \\frac{g(s)}{g(t-1)} x_{s}+x_{t}=a_{t} \\sum_{s=1}^{t-1} c_{t-1, s} x_{s}+x_{t}=a_{t} y_{t-1}+x_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBased on the Theorem 3.1, for linear recurrence, we can directly discuss $g(t)$, as $a_{t}$ can be obtained through $\\frac{g(t-1)}{g(t)}$. Intuitively, $g(t)$ can be interpreted as an importance score up to moment $t, c_{t s}=\\frac{g(s)}{g(t)}$ can be interpreted as the ratio of the score at moment $s$ relative to moment $t$, and $a_{t}$ can be interpreted as the ratio of the previous moment's score to moment $t$ 's score.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/15 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nThe parallel-scan computation outlined in section 3.2 was used for all experiments. To obtain values $v_{n}$, keys $k_{n}$, and queries $q_{n}$, we apply linear projections to the input $x_{n}$, following Vaswani et al. (2023). As suggested by Orvieto et al. (2023) and Sun et al.

This bias is evident when plotting the (centered) stable-exponential amplitude activation function. In contrast, the sigmoid function does not have this bias. For our experiments, we chose sigmoid as the magnitude activation. Because the imaginary part of an individual state transition is not strictly required to be restricted to a specific interval, we omit the phase activation. For the model details, we refer to appendix $C$. ## 5 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\n\nIn this section, we report experimental results validating our hypothesis that data-controlled state transitions yield empirical benefits in sequence modeling. First we design a synthetic language modeling task that offers interpretable insights to our method. Moreover, we assess the performance of our method for autoregressive natural language modeling.

LUT-GEMM: Quantized Matrix Multiplication based on LUTs for Efficient Inference in Large-Scale Generative Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: scan operation implementation language models*\n\n*Gunho Park, Baeseong Park, Minsub Kim, Sungjae Lee, Jeonghoon Kim, Beomseok Kwon, S. Kwon, Byeongwook Kim, Youngjoo Lee, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces LUT-GEMM, an efficient kernel for quantized matrix multiplication, which not only eliminates the resource-intensive dequantization process but also reduces computational costs compared to previous kernels for weight-only quantization.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture have significantly improved natural language processing (NLP), achieving remarkably low perplexity. However, the growing size of NLP models introduces a memory wall problem during the generation phase. To mitigate this issue, recent efforts have focused on quantizing model weights to sub-4-bit precision while preserving full precision for activations, resulting in practical speed-ups during inference on a single GPU. However, these improvements primarily stem from reduced memory movement, which necessitates a resource-intensive dequantization process rather than actual computational reduction. In this paper, we introduce LUT-GEMM, an efficient kernel for quantized matrix multiplication, which not only eliminates the resource-intensive dequantization process but also reduces computational costs compared to previous kernels for weight-only quantization. Furthermore, we proposed group-wise quantization to offer a flexible trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy. The impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios through low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations. We show experimentally that when applied to the OPT-175B model with 3-bit quantization, LUT-GEMM substantially accelerates token generation latency, achieving a remarkable 2.1$\\times$ improvement on a single GPU when compared to OPTQ, which relies on the costly dequantization process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

However, since both the parameter and the output space are highly discretized, such networks have proven very difficult to optimize. The difficulties are compounded for the class of transformer text generation models due to the sensitivity of the attention operation to quantization and the noise-compounding effects of autoregressive decoding in the high-cardinality output space. We approach the problem with a mix of statistics-based quantization for the weights and elastic quantization of the activations and demonstrate the first ternary and binary transformer models on the downstream tasks of summarization and machine translation. Our ternary BART base achieves an R1 score of 41 on the CNN/DailyMail benchmark, which is merely 3.9 points behind the full model while being 16x more efficient. Our binary model, while less accurate, achieves a highly non-trivial score of 35.6. For machine translation, we achieved BLEU scores of 21.7 and 17.6 on the WMT16 En-Ro benchmark, compared with a full precision mBART model score of 26.8. We also compare our approach in the 8-bit activation setting, where our ternary and even binary weight models can match or outperform the best existing 8-bit weight models in the literature.

Such a dialogue system can help users explore datasets and models with explanations in a contextualized manner, e.g. via clarification or follow-up questions, and through a natural language interface. We adapt the conversational explanation framework TalkToModel (Slack et al., 2022) to the NLP domain, add new NLP-specific operations such as free-text rationalization, and illustrate its generalizability on three NLP tasks (dialogue act classification, question answering, hate speech detection). To recognize user queries for explanations, we evaluate fine-tuned and few-shot prompting models and implement a novel Adapter-based approach. We then conduct two user studies on (1) the perceived correctness and helpfulness of the dialogues, and (2) the simulatability, i.e. how objectively helpful dialogical explanations are for humans in figuring out the model's predicted label when it's not shown. We found rationalization and feature attribution were helpful in explaining the model behavior. Moreover, users could more reliably predict the model outcome based on an explanation dialogue rather than one-off explanations.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Cheaply Estimating Inference Efficiency Metrics for Autoregressive Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency metrics autoregressive models*\n\n*Deepak Narayanan, Keshav Santhanam, Peter Henderson, Rishi Bommasani, Tony Lee, Percy Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new metric for inference efficiency called idealized runtime is proposed, that puts models on equal footing as though they were served on uniform hardware and software without performance contention, and a cost model is proposed to efficiently estimate this metric for autoregressive Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable but also computationally expensive. Characterizing the fundamental tradeoff between inference efficiency and model capabilities is thus important, but requires an efficiency metric that is comparable across models from different providers. Unfortunately, raw runtimes measured through black-box APIs do not satisfy this property: model providers can implement software and hardware optimizations orthogonal to the model, and shared infrastructure introduces performance contention. We propose a new metric for inference efficiency called idealized runtime , that puts models on equal footing as though they were served on uniform hardware and software without performance contention, and a cost model to efficiently estimate this metric for autoregressive Transformer models. We also propose variants of the idealized runtime that incorporate the number and type of accelerators needed to serve the model. Using these metrics, we compare ten LLMs developed in 2022 to provide the first analysis of inference efficiency-capability tradeoffs; we make several observations from this analysis, including the fact that the superior inference runtime performance of certain APIs is often a byproduct of optimizations within the API rather than the underlying model.

However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Unlike prior work, MAGNeT is comprised of a single-stage, non-autoregressive transformer. During training, we predict spans of masked tokens obtained from a masking scheduler, while during inference we gradually construct the output sequence using several decoding steps. To further enhance the quality of the generated audio, we introduce a novel rescoring method in which, we leverage an external pre-trained model to rescore and rank predictions from MAGNeT, which will be then used for later decoding steps. Lastly, we explore a hybrid version of MAGNeT, in which we fuse between autoregressive and non-autoregressive models to generate the first few seconds in an autoregressive manner while the rest of the sequence is being decoded in parallel. We demonstrate the efficiency of MAGNeT for the task of text-to-music and text-to-audio generation and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering both objective metrics and human studies. The proposed approach is comparable to the evaluated baselines, while being significantly faster (x7 faster than the autoregressive baseline). Through ablation studies and analysis, we shed light on the importance of each of the components comprising MAGNeT, together with pointing to the trade-offs between autoregressive and non-autoregressive modeling, considering latency, throughput, and generation quality.

Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors\n\n*From Search Query: state management sequence models*\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work finds vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and improves the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Hebrew NLP\n\n*From Search Query: state management sequence models*\n\n*Matan Eyal, Hila Noga, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Reut Tsarfaty*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that sequence-to-sequence generative architectures are more suitable for LLMs in the case of morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew, and suggested that multilingual sequence- to-sequence models present a promising building block for NLP for MRLs.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work attributes progress in NLP to large language models (LMs) with increased model size and large quantities of pretraining data. Despite this, current state-of-the-art LMs for Hebrew are both under-parameterized and under-trained compared to LMs in other languages. Additionally, previous work on pretrained Hebrew LMs focused on encoder-only models. While the encoder-only architecture is beneficial for classification tasks, it does not cater well for sub-word prediction tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, when considering the morphologically rich nature of Hebrew. In this paper we argue that sequence-to-sequence generative architectures are more suitable for LLMs in the case of morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew. We demonstrate that by casting tasks in the Hebrew NLP pipeline as text-to-text tasks, we can leverage powerful multilingual, pretrained sequence-to-sequence models as mT5, eliminating the need for a specialized, morpheme-based, separately fine-tuned decoder. Using this approach, our experiments show substantial improvements over previously published results on existing Hebrew NLP benchmarks. These results suggest that multilingual sequence-to-sequence models present a promising building block for NLP for MRLs.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neural Image Compression via Non-Local Attention Optimization and Improved Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency metrics autoregressive models*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yao Wang, Xun Cao, Haojie Liu, Tong Chen, Qiu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel Non-Local Attention optmization and Improved Context modeling-based image compression (NLAIC) algorithm, which is built on top of the deep nerual network (DNN)-based variational auto-encoder (VAE) structure. Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Forecasting trends in food security with real time data\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency metrics autoregressive models*\n\n*Ilaria Lauzana, Kyriacos Koupparis, Amine Baha, Giulia Martini, Duccio Piovani, Christoph R\u00e4th, Joschka Herteux*\n\n**Abstract:** Early warning systems are an essential tool for effective humanitarian action. Advance warnings on impending disasters facilitate timely and targeted response which help save lives and livelihoods. In this work we present a quantitative methodology to forecast levels of food consumption for 60 consecutive days, at the sub-national level, in four countries: Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen. The methodology is built on publicly available data from the World Food Programme's global hunger monitoring system which collects, processes, and displays daily updates on key food security metrics, conflict, weather events, and other drivers of food insecurity. In this study we assessed the performance of various models including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Reservoir Computing (RC), by comparing their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. Our findings highlight Reservoir Computing as a particularly well-suited model in the field of food security given both its notable resistance to over-fitting on limited data samples and its efficient training capabilities. The methodology we introduce establishes the groundwork for a global, data-driven early warning system designed to anticipate and detect food insecurity.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context\n\n*From Search Query: state management sequence models*\n\n*Jaime Carbonell, Quoc V. Le, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Zihang Dai, Zhilin Yang, Yiming Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n**Conference:** transformer-xl-attentive-language-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: state management sequence models*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on the implementation details of scan operations and memory efficiency optimization techniques for state management, here are some key insights and references:\n\n## Scan Operation Implementation in Autoregressive Models\n\n### Efficient Sequence Modeling\nThe work on \"Efficiently Scanning and Resampling Spatio-Temporal Tasks with Irregular Observations\" introduces a novel algorithm that alternates between cross-attention and a weighted inclusive scan to accumulate context over time. This approach is particularly relevant for autoregressive models as it efficiently aggregates historical information using a parallel algorithm, which can be performed on a GPU using an inclusive-scan operation. This method allows for the accumulation of temporal information in a way that is computationally efficient and scalable.\n\n### Mathematical Foundations and Block Processing\nThe analysis note highlights the importance of block-based processing techniques, which are well-established and mathematically well-founded. The scan-based approach, similar to the one proposed in the FlashAttention paper, uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, optimizing memory access patterns for modern architectures. This IO-aware block processing can be adapted for autoregressive models to enhance hardware efficiency.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Metrics and Optimization Techniques\n\n### IO-Aware Processing\nThe FlashAttention paper provides a detailed example of an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that reduces memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach can be applied to autoregressive models to improve memory efficiency by optimizing memory access patterns during training and inference.\n\n### State Management Techniques\nThe proposed algorithm in the \"Efficiently Scanning and Resampling Spatio-Temporal Tasks\" work uses a set of tokens to represent the hidden state, allowing effective use of attention mechanisms to inject or extract information. This approach helps in managing state efficiently by accumulating context over time through a weighted inclusive scan, which can be performed in parallel. This method ensures that variables accumulate context conditioned on an accumulated history, which is crucial for state management in autoregressive models.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\nThe HAT paper emphasizes the importance of hardware-aware design for low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms. This involves neural architecture search to optimize memory access patterns and state synchronization between blocks, which are critical considerations for improving the memory efficiency and overall performance of autoregressive models.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Block Size Optimization and State Synchronization\nThe analysis note points out the need for detailed consideration of block size optimization and careful handling of state synchronization between blocks. These aspects are crucial for ensuring that the scan-based approach and block processing strategy do not introduce inefficiencies or inconsistencies in the model's state management[Analysis Note].\n\n### Benchmarks and Metrics\nTo evaluate the memory efficiency of autoregressive models, benchmarks such as those mentioned in the FlashAttention and Gated Linear Attention papers can be used. These benchmarks focus on metrics like memory reads/writes, computational complexity, and training/inference speeds, which are essential for assessing the overall efficiency of the model.\n\nBy incorporating these insights and techniques, researchers can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models, enhancing their memory efficiency, state management, and overall performance.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAll models have roughly 6 M total parameters. ## E. 5 Efficiency Benchmark\n\nScan Operation. We compare the core operation of selective SSMs, which is the parallel scan (Section 3.3), against convolution and attention, measured on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Note that these do not include the cost of other operations outside of this core operation, such as computing the convolutional kernel in global-convolution models, or computing the QKV projections in attention. As a baseline, we implement a standard parallel scan in PyTorch with no kernel fusion. This requires materializing the parameters $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C$ in HBM. Our scan implementation fuses the discretization step and the parallel scan, avoiding the cost of materializing all the large parameters in HBM. Table 15: (Memory benchmark.) Mamba's memory footprint is comparable to the most optimized Transformer. Results for 125M models. | Batch size | Transformer (w/ FlashAttention-2) | Mamba |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 1 | 4.6 GB | 4.8 GB |\n| 2 | 5.2 GB | 5.8 GB |\n| 4 | 6.9 GB | 7.3 GB |\n| 8 | 11.5 GB | 12.3 GB |\n| 16 | 20.7 GB | 23.1 GB |\n| 32 | 34.5 GB | 38.2 GB |\n\nFor convolution, we use the standard implementation in PyTorch, which separately performs FFTs on the inputs and the filters, multiply them in frequency domain, then performs an inverse FFT to obtain the result. The theoretical complexity is $O(L \\log (L))$ for sequence length $L$. For attention, we compare against the fastest implementation that we are aware of (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), with causal mask. Note that FlashAttention-2 with causal mask is about $1.7 \\times$ faster than without causal mask, since approximately only half of the attention entries are computed. We use batch size of 1 and increase the sequence length from $2^{9}=512,2^{10} \\approx 1 K, 2^{11} \\approx 2 K$, up to $2^{19} \\approx 500 K$ (some of the baselines run out of memory before reaching 500 K ). We use a model dimension of $D=1024$ and state dimension $N=16$. We measure with BF16 inputs, which is the data type most commonly used for large scale training. End-to-end Inference. We measure the inference throughput of a Mamba 1.4B model and an untrained Mamba 6.9B model, against a standard Transformer (GPT3 architecture) at 1.3B and 6.7B size. We use the standard Transformer implementation in the Huggingface transformers library. We set the prompt length to be 2048 and the generation length to be 128 . We vary the batch size from $1,2,4,8,16$, 32,64 , to 128 , and measure time time taken to generate 128 tokens. We then calculate the throughput (tokens/s) as batch size $\\times 128$ /time taken. We repeat the measurements 3 times and take the average. Measurements are done on an A100 80GB PCIe GPU. Memory Benchmark. The memory usage simply scales proportionally to the size of the activation tensors, as with most deep sequence models. We report measurements of the training memory requirements of 125 M models on 1 A100 80GB GPU. Each batch consists of sequences of length 2048. We compare to the most memory-efficient Transformer implementation we are aware of (with kernel fusion from torch. compile and with FlashAttention-2). Table 15 shows that Mamba's memory requirement is comparable to a similar-sized Transformer with an extremely optimized implementation, and we expect further improvement in Mamba's memory footprint in the future.\n```\n\n#### 2. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

All experiments are conducted using an NVIDIA A100 80GB GPU. Note that during training, the sequence length and batch dimensions are flattened, making the effective batch size the product of these dimensions. Our experiments show that our fused operator benefits from larger batch sizes in terms of faster training speeds and reduced memory consumption. When the batch size is $2^{8}$, the training speed of the 1.3 B parameter model improves from 1.52 s to 1.21 s per iteration, a $25.6 \\%$ speedup over the vanilla implementation. Additionally, memory consumption decreases from 82 GB to 32 GB , a $61.0 \\%$ reduction in memory usage. The performance of the Fused implementation improves significantly with larger batch sizes, allowing more samples to be processed simultaneously and reducing the total number of iterations. ### 4.5 Inference Efficiency Comparison\n\nFig. 4(d) presents a comparison of GPU inference memory consumption and latency between the proposed MatMul-free LM and Transformer++ for various model sizes. In the MatMul-free LM, we employ BitBLAS [60] for acceleration to further improve efficiency. The evaluation is conducted with a batch size of 1 and a sequence length of 2048. The MatMul-free LM consistently demonstrates lower memory usage and latency compared to Transformer++ across all model sizes. For a single layer, the MatMul-free LM requires only 0.12 GB of GPU memory and achieves a latency of 3.79 ms , while Transformer++ consumes 0.21 GB of memory and has a latency of 13.87 ms . As the model size increases, the memory and latency advantages of the MatMul-free LM become more pronounced. It is worth noting that for model sizes larger than 2.7 B , the results are simulated using randomly initialized weights. For the largest model size of 13B parameters, the MatMul-free LM uses only 4.19 GB of GPU memory and has a latency of 695.48 ms , whereas Transformer++ requires 48.50 GB of memory and exhibits a latency of 3183.10 ms . These results highlight the efficiency gains achieved by the MatMul-free LM, making it a promising approach for large-scale language modeling tasks, particularly during inference. ## 5 FPGA Implementation and Results\n\n### 5.1 Implementation\n\nTo test the power usage and effectiveness of the MatMul-free LM on custom hardware that can better exploit ternary operations, we created an FPGA accelerator in SystemVerilog.\n```\n\n#### 3. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

To reduce the time required for reads and writes, a key principle is to fuse multiple operations on the same data slice while it's in fast memory before writing it back to slow memory. ### 5.1 Taylor Exponential Linear Attention\n\nDespite the theoretically improved complexity, the linear attention methods demonstrated in prior work are often less efficient than highly-optimized softmax attention implementations (Flash Attention [12]) when measured in real-world wall-clock time and memory usage. We next present hardware-aware algorithms to make Taylor linear attention efficient. We focus on two operations: (1) prefill, corresponding to processing the prompt during generation or the forward pass during training, and (2) next token prediction during generation, which also requires updating the recurrent hidden state state. In this section, we refer to the batch size as $B$, number of heads as $H$, head dimension as $d$, sequence length as $N$ and feature dimension as $d^{\\prime}$, following Section 4 . For ease of notation, let $D=1+d^{\\prime}+d^{\\prime 2}$ in this section. Additional details for the IO-Aware algorithms are included in Appendix B. ### 5.1.1 Forward Pass / Generation Prefill\n\nBaseline Implementation The na\u00efve implementation detailed in Appendix B (1) produces the feature maps $Q, K,(2)$ computes and materializes the large hidden state $K V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times d \\times D}$, then (3) computes the causal dot product between $Q$ and $K V$. Prior work has released popular CUDA kernels for linear attention to efficiently perform the causal dot product / step (3) 34. The kernel parallelizes computation across the heads and batches, loads tiles of $V$ and $K$ to SRAM, updates the running $K V$ state in SRAM, loads tiles of $Q$ to SRAM, produces the final output in SRAM, and writes the result to HBM. Analysis In overall IO cost, ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, this procedure requires $2 B H N D$ bytes for writing featurized $Q, K$ to HBM. During the causal dot product, this requires $2 B H N D+B H N d$ bytes to read $Q, K, V$ tiles and $B H N d$ bytes to write the result. Throughout the computation, $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes (note this is the shape $K V$ state during the forward pass) are read in and out of thread registers to SRAM to update the running output and $K V$ state at $19 \\mathrm{~TB} / \\mathrm{s}$ bandwidth. Algorithm To improve efficiency, our algorithm computes both the feature map and the causal dot product in fast memory. Our overall algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1 and we discuss the overall process here. The algorithm first parallelizes over the batch $B$ and head $H$ dimensions, since computation is independent for each head in each batch. We consider the three terms $T_{0}, T_{1}, T_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ in the linear attention output, corresponding to the three terms in the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor polynomial for the exponential. We also consider the corresponding three terms, in the cumulative $K V$ state as we process a sequence. For a given tile (i.e. sub-matrix) of $Q, K, V$, we load the tiles (e.g., tile of $Q, K \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 16}$ and $V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{16 \\times 64}$ given 16 tokens, 16 feature dimension, and 64 head dimension) into fast memory and update the running $K V$ state and output for each of the three terms. We load the tiles into the register file and fuse-operations to compute the causal dot product in register, only writing to SRAM to synchronize the cumulative $K V$ state across parallel warps. We use explicit writes to SRAM for this synchronization because register memory is warp-specific (threads in one warp do not access the registers for a thread in a different warp). Analysis In IO cost, again ignoring the input and output projections in the linear attention layer, our procedure requires $2 B H N d^{\\prime}$ bytes for reading $q, k$ and $2 B H N d$ bytes for reading $v$ and writing output $y$ between HBM and SRAM. Overall, our algorithm avoids in HBM $\\mathcal{O}(2 B H N D)$ bytes in HBM to SRAM data movement. We additionally improve upon the baseline by performing computation in-register to avoid the $\\mathcal{O}(B H N D d)$ bytes in SRAM to register data movement. ### 5.1.2 Next token prediction\n\nDuring next token prediction, an important consideration is how to efficiently update the recurrent state $K V_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D d}$ at timestep $t$. The expensive operation during next token prediction is computing the outer product between projected hidden states $k_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H D}$ and $v_{t+1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B H d}$. The outer product requires $\\mathcal{O}(B H D d)$ computation and space, and the result is summed with $K V_{t}$ to produce $K V_{t+1}$. We provide an IO-aware algorithm for the state updates in Algorithm 2. This algorithm incurs $\\mathcal{O}(B H D+B H d)$ bytes of HBM to SRAM data movement (to load the $q, k, v$ projections). ## 5.2 tcWindow\n\nNext we motivate the choice of window size for TCWINDOW. In contrast to sliding-window style models such as the popular Mistral models, which use large window sizes $w=4096$ [10], BASED chooses a window size based on hardware specifications. GPU tensor cores operate on $16 \\times 16$ tiles. Large GEMMs are compute bound (for e.g. in long-context attention). But, we need sufficient occupancy to hide the latency of the tensor core units. Figure 1 (Right) shows $64 \\times 64$ dimension matrix multiplications are approximately the same latency as $16 \\times 16$. BASED sets $w$ to use $64 \\times 64$ tiles (Figure 1). To distinguish from prior sliding windows, we refer to this approach as TCWindow. We use the Flash Attention sliding window implementation during training [11] and in Appendix B Algorithm 3, we provide an IO-aware algorithm of TCWindow for next token prediction. End-to-end benchmarks for BASED implemented with these IO-aware algorithms are provided in Section 6 . Micro-benchmarks for each kernel against the baseline implementations are provided in Appendix B. ## 6 Results\n\nIn this section, we present results for the following claims:\n\n1. Language modeling overall. We evaluate architectures in pretraining from scratch on the Pile 330] and on standard benchmarks from the LM Eval Harness [16. We find BASED matches or outperforms the strongest sub-quadratic architectures (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/38 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.15574, 2024.

In the setup for our experiment, we adhere to specific configurations outlined in the respective papers. In the case of StreamingLLM [69], the initial four tokens remain unmasked, serving as the attention sink. For H 2 O [75], we ensure the same number of heavy hitter tokens and recent tokens. Note that H 2 O uses dense prefill since it relies on the column sum of the attention matrix to calculate the importance of every token for KV-Cache eviction. StreamingLLM and MoA use sparse prefill. Models and Benchmarks. Since vicuna-7b-v1.5-16k and vicuna-13b-v1.5-16k [8] can only take in 16 k context length, we use the 16 k split of LV-Eval benchmark [70], truncating the input to 15500 for model input. For the LongBench benchmark [4], we use the LongBench-E split, which features a balanced number of data items at every length level. The LongBench dataset is segmented into ranges of $0-4 \\mathrm{k}, 4-8 \\mathrm{k}$, and $8 \\mathrm{k}+$ tokens. We test each split using the input length truncation thresholds of $3,500,7,500$, and 15,500 tokens, respectively. Perplexity Evaluation. We construct a comprehensive yet concise test set by sampling $50 \\times 4$ data items for each length level from the test split of four long-context understanding datasets: Qasper [15], MultiNew [17], TREC [38, 28] and LCC [45], representing the question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and code completion abilities of the LLM.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: performance metrics scan operations, hardware optimization techniques language models, memory efficiency benchmarks production\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Robust Scheduling with GFlowNets\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics scan operations*\n\n*David W. Zhang, Corrado Rainone, M. Peschl, R. Bondesan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a technique to control the trade-off between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and shows that conditioning the GFlowNet on the computation graph enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and real-world compiler datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Finding the best way to schedule operations in a computation graph is a classical NP-hard problem which is central to compiler optimization. However, evaluating the goodness of a schedule on the target hardware can be very time-consuming. Traditional approaches as well as previous machine learning ones typically optimize proxy metrics, which are fast to evaluate but can lead to bad schedules when tested on the target hardware. In this work, we propose a new approach to scheduling by sampling proportionally to the proxy metric using a novel GFlowNet method. We introduce a technique to control the trade-off between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and demonstrate empirically that the pure optimization baselines can lead to subpar performance with respect to our approach when tested on a target model. Furthermore, we show that conditioning the GFlowNet on the computation graph enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and real-world compiler datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2.

Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work defines a broad family of metric spaces that quantify representational dissimilarity and forms a novel metric that respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identifies approximate Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method.\n\n**Abstract:** Understanding the operation of biological and artificial networks remains a difficult and important challenge. To identify general principles, researchers are increasingly interested in surveying large collections of networks that are trained on, or biologically adapted to, similar tasks. A standardized set of analysis tools is now needed to identify how network-level covariates-such as architecture, anatomical brain region, and model organism-impact neural representations (hidden layer activations). Here, we provide a rigorous foundation for these analyses by defining a broad family of metric spaces that quantify representational dissimilarity. Using this framework, we modify existing representational similarity measures based on canonical correlation analysis and centered kernel alignment to satisfy the triangle inequality, formulate a novel metric that respects the inductive biases in convolutional layers, and identify approximate Euclidean embeddings that enable network representations to be incorporated into essentially any off-the-shelf machine learning method. We demonstrate these methods on large-scale datasets from biology (Allen Institute Brain Observatory) and deep learning (NAS-Bench-101). In doing so, we identify relationships between neural representations that are interpretable in terms of anatomical features and model performance.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3.

We examine how well off-the-shelf LLMs can solve this challenging task, assessing a total of 44 models, differing in size, architecture, pre-training methods, and accessibility, on three test sets from different domains (Wikipedia, news, and medical) under a few-shot setting. Our analysis considers a suite of automatic metrics as well as a large-scale quantitative investigation into the types of common edit operations performed by the different models. Furthermore, we perform a manual qualitative analysis on a subset of model outputs to better gauge the quality of the generated simplifications. Our evaluation indicates that the best LLMs, despite not being trained on TS, perform comparably with state-of-the-art TS baselines. Additionally, we find that certain LLMs demonstrate a greater range and diversity of edit operations.

SliceGPT: Compress Large Language Models by Deleting Rows and Columns\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques language models*\n\n*Saleh Ashkboos, Maximilian L. Croci, Marcelo Gennari do Nascimento, Torsten Hoefler, James Hensman*\n\n**TL;DR:** SliceGPT is presented, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for LLAMA2-70B, OPT 66B and Phi-2 models while maintaining 99%, 99% and 90% zero-shot task performance of the dense model respectively. Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA2-70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.

Federated Learning of Large Language Models with Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning and Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques language models*\n\n*Tianshi Che, Ji Liu, Yang Zhou, Jiaxiang Ren, Jiwen Zhou, Victor S. Sheng, H. Dai, D. Dou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs and a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further. Extensive experiments based on 10 datasets demonstrate the superb performance (up to 60.8\\% in terms of accuracy) and efficiency (up to 97.59\\% in terms of training time) of FedPepTAO compared with 9 baseline approaches.

Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency benchmarks production*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

In this work, we investigate the online memory selection problem from an information-theoretic perspective. To gather the most information, we propose the \\textit{surprise} and the \\textit{learnability} criteria to pick informative points and to avoid outliers. We present a Bayesian model to compute the criteria efficiently by exploiting rank-one matrix structures. We demonstrate that these criteria encourage selecting informative points in a greedy algorithm for online memory selection. Furthermore, by identifying the importance of \\textit{the timing to update the memory}, we introduce a stochastic information-theoretic reservoir sampler (InfoRS), which conducts sampling among selective points with high information. Compared to reservoir sampling, InfoRS demonstrates improved robustness against data imbalance. Finally, empirical performances over continual learning benchmarks manifest its efficiency and efficacy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9. Reinforcement Learning with Fast and Forgetful Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency benchmarks production*\n\n*Steven D.

Most model-free approaches summarize the trajectory into a latent Markov state using memory models borrowed from Supervised Learning (SL), even though RL tends to exhibit different training and efficiency characteristics. Addressing this discrepancy, we introduce Fast and Forgetful Memory, an algorithm-agnostic memory model designed specifically for RL. Our approach constrains the model search space via strong structural priors inspired by computational psychology. It is a drop-in replacement for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in recurrent RL algorithms, achieving greater reward than RNNs across various recurrent benchmarks and algorithms without changing any hyperparameters. Moreover, Fast and Forgetful Memory exhibits training speeds two orders of magnitude faster than RNNs, attributed to its logarithmic time and linear space complexity.

Capture, Learning, and Synthesis of 3D Speaking Styles\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics scan operations*\n\n*Daniel Cudeiro, Michael J. Black, Cassidy Laidlaw, Anurag Ranjan, Timo Bolkart*\n\n**Abstract:** Audio-driven 3D facial animation has been widely explored, but achieving realistic, human-like performance is still unsolved. This is due to the lack of available 3D datasets, models, and standard evaluation metrics. To address this, we introduce a unique 4D face dataset with about 29 minutes of 4D scans captured at 60 fps and synchronized audio from 12 speakers. We then train a neural network on our dataset that factors identity from facial motion. The learned model, VOCA (Voice Operated Character Animation) takes any speech signal as input - even speech in languages other than English - and realistically animates a wide range of adult faces. Conditioning on subject labels during training allows the model to learn a variety of realistic speaking styles. VOCA also provides animator controls to alter speaking style, identity-dependent facial shape, and pose (i.e. head, jaw, and eyeball rotations) during animation. To our knowledge, VOCA is the only realistic 3D facial animation model that is readily applicable to unseen subjects without retargeting. This makes VOCA suitable for tasks like in-game video, virtual reality avatars, or any scenario in which the speaker, speech, or language is not known in advance. We make the dataset and model available for research purposes at http://voca.is.tue.mpg.de.\n\n**Conference:** capture-learning-and-synthesis-of-3d-speaking-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. MAD-ICP: It Is All About Matching Data -- Robust and Informed LiDAR Odometry\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics scan operations*\n\n*Giorgio Grisetti, Leonardo Brizi, Luca Di Giammarino, Simone Ferrari*\n\n**Abstract:** LiDAR odometry is the task of estimating the ego-motion of the sensor from sequential laser scans. This problem has been addressed by the community for more than two decades, and many effective solutions are available nowadays. Most of these systems implicitly rely on assumptions about the operating environment, the sensor used, and motion pattern. When these assumptions are violated, several well-known systems tend to perform poorly. This paper presents a LiDAR odometry system that can overcome these limitations and operate well under different operating conditions while achieving performance comparable with domain-specific methods. Our algorithm follows the well-known ICP paradigm that leverages a PCA-based kd-tree implementation that is used to extract structural information about the clouds being registered and to compute the minimization metric for the alignment. The drift is bound by managing the local map based on the estimated uncertainty of the tracked pose. To benefit the community, we release an open-source C++ anytime real-time implementation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques language models*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Elixir: Train a Large Language Model on a Small GPU Cluster\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques language models*\n\n*Yang You, Shenggui Li, Hongxin Liu, Jiarui Fang, Haichen Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, large language models have achieved great success due to their unprecedented size. However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models. The beta version of Elixir is now available at https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/feature/elixir.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. An Attention Free Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency benchmarks production*\n\n*Josh Susskind, Ruixiang Zhang, Hanlin Goh, Chen Huang, Nitish Srivastava, Walter Talbott, Shuangfei Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Attention Free Transformer (AFT), an efficient variant of Transformers that eliminates the need for dot product self attention. In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n**Conference:** an-attention-free-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. Taskflow: A Lightweight Parallel and Heterogeneous Task Graph Computing System\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficiency benchmarks production*\n\n*Yibo Lin, Chun-Xun Lin, Dian-Lun Lin, Tsung-Wei Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Taskflow aims to streamline the building of parallel and heterogeneous applications using a lightweight task graph-based approach. Taskflow introduces an expressive task graph programming model to assist developers in the implementation of parallel and heterogeneous decomposition strategies on a heterogeneous computing platform. Our programming model distinguishes itself as a very general class of task graph parallelism with in-graph control flow to enable end-to-end parallel optimization. To support our model with high performance, we design an efficient system runtime that solves many of the new scheduling challenges arising out of our models and optimizes the performance across latency, energy efficiency, and throughput. We have demonstrated the promising performance of Taskflow in real-world applications. As an example, Taskflow solves a large-scale machine learning workload up to 29% faster, 1.5x less memory, and 1.9x higher throughput than the industrial system, oneTBB, on a machine of 40 CPUs and 4 GPUs. We have opened the source of Taskflow and deployed it to large numbers of users in the open-source community.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on performance metrics, scan operations, and hardware-specific optimization techniques for memory efficiency, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks for Scan Operations\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- The use of parallel scan operations can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models. Studies such as \"Simplified State Space Layers\" and \"Convolutional State Space Models\" demonstrate that parallel scans can achieve subquadratic parallelization and reduce the computational depth, making the models more efficient.\n\n### Benchmarking Framework\n- A comprehensive benchmarking framework is essential for evaluating the performance of scan operations. This involves metrics such as response times, accuracy, and the types of queries handled. The article on \"Benchmarking LLMs Insight Discovery Capabilities\" suggests using synthetic problem generation to evaluate performance metrics, which can be adapted for scan operations in language models.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques for Memory Efficiency\n\n### IO-Aware Block Processing\n- Optimizing memory access patterns through IO-aware block processing can reduce memory transfers and improve overall efficiency. This technique aligns with modern hardware architectures and is supported by research on structured state operations and convolutional state space models.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\n- Block-based processing techniques can reduce memory overhead by minimizing the amount of data that needs to be transferred and processed. This approach is well-established and has clear mathematical foundations, as mentioned in the analysis of the ScanKernelDDLerpLinear proposal.\n\n### Memory Management\n- Efficient state updates through structured operations and careful consideration of block boundaries are crucial for memory management. This includes optimizing block sizes and handling state synchronization between blocks, which are areas that need further investigation.\n\n## Real-World Case Studies and Production Deployments\n\n### LLM Monitoring and Optimization\n- Integrating LLM monitoring into the overall operations strategy can help in continuous improvement and optimization. This includes tracking performance metrics, detecting anomalies, and making automated adjustments, which can be applied to optimize memory efficiency and scan operations in production deployments.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n- For real-world deployments, it is important to consider the practical aspects such as the reliability and trustworthiness of the models. Tools and processes should be designed to scale with the model and its applications, ensuring long-term sustainability and performance. This includes ensuring that the models adapt to changes in input data and emerging biases.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that optimize memory usage and leverage hardware-specific optimizations effectively.\n",
