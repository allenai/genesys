One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 2. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/38 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Linear attention is (maybe) all you need (to understand transformer optimization)\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformer\"*\n\n*Kwangjun Ahn, Xiang Cheng, Minhak Song, Chulhee Yun, A. Jadbabaie, S. Sra*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer training is notoriously difficult, requiring a careful design of optimizers and use of various heuristics. We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformer\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** SEA is proposed: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask, which estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 260  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Dong Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, S. Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) is proposed, a new TTS model which aligns gain and bias of the text input according to the style extracted from a reference speech audio which effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even from single speech audio.\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized speech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical applicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few audio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However, existing methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low adaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a new TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also effectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input according to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our model effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even from single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to speech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two discriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training. The experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech which accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3 sec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 131  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n#### 5. Pit One Against Many: Leveraging Attention-head Embeddings for Parameter-efficient Multi-head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Huiyin Xue, Nikolaos Aletras*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head, and empirically demonstrates that this MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling pre-trained language models has resulted in large performance gains in various natural language processing tasks but comes with a large cost in memory requirements. Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Jinjie Ni, Rui Mao, Zonglin Yang, Han Lei, E. Cambria*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, it is assumed that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed some issues of Multi-Head Attention (MHA), e.g., redundancy and over-parameterization. Specifically, the heads of MHA were originally designed to attend to information from different representation subspaces, whereas prior studies found that some attention heads likely learn similar features and can be pruned without harming performance. Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, we assume that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs. In particular, we propose Grouped Head Attention, trained with a self-supervised group constraint that group attention heads, where each group focuses on an essential but distinctive feature subset. We additionally propose a Voting-to-Stay procedure to remove redundant heads, thus achieving a transformer with lighter weights. Extensive experiments are consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, our method achieves significant performance gains on three well-established tasks while considerably compressing parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformer\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformer\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Training Integer-Only Deep Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Vahid Partovi Nia, Eyy\u00fcb Sari, Vanessa Courville, Masoud Asgharian*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the backbone of many text and speech\napplications. These architectures are typically made up of several\ncomputationally complex components such as; non-linear activation functions,\nnormalization, bi-directional dependence and attention. In order to maintain\ngood accuracy, these components are frequently run using full-precision\nfloating-point computation, making them slow, inefficient and difficult to\ndeploy on edge devices. In addition, the complex nature of these operations\nmakes them challenging to quantize using standard quantization methods without\na significant performance drop. We present a quantization-aware training method\nfor obtaining a highly accurate integer-only recurrent neural network (iRNN).\nOur approach supports layer normalization, attention, and an adaptive piecewise\nlinear (PWL) approximation of activation functions, to serve a wide range of\nstate-of-the-art RNNs. The proposed method enables RNN-based language models to\nrun on edge devices with $2\\times$ improvement in runtime, and $4\\times$\nreduction in model size while maintaining similar accuracy as its\nfull-precision counterpart.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-22T15:22:36Z  (*Updated: 2022-12-22T15:22:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformer\"*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Angelos Katharopoulos, Nikolaos Pappas, Apoorv Vyas*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive layer normalization\"*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Charles Staats, Markus N. Rabe*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Separable Self-attention for Mobile Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Mohammad Rastegari, Sachin Mehta*\n\n**Abstract:** Mobile vision transformers (MobileViT) can achieve state-of-the-art performance across several mobile vision tasks, including classification and detection. Though these models have fewer parameters, they have high latency as compared to convolutional neural network-based models. The main efficiency bottleneck in MobileViT is the multi-headed self-attention (MHA) in transformers, which requires $O(k^2)$ time complexity with respect to the number of tokens (or patches) $k$. Moreover, MHA requires costly operations (e.g., batch-wise matrix multiplication) for computing self-attention, impacting latency on resource-constrained devices. This paper introduces a separable self-attention method with linear complexity, i.e. $O(k)$. A simple yet effective characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses element-wise operations for computing self-attention, making it a good choice for resource-constrained devices. The improved model, MobileViTv2, is state-of-the-art on several mobile vision tasks, including ImageNet object classification and MS-COCO object detection. With about three million parameters, MobileViTv2 achieves a top-1 accuracy of 75.6% on the ImageNet dataset, outperforming MobileViT by about 1% while running $3.2\\times$ faster on a mobile device.

For example, Linformer reduces the complexity to O(N) by projecting keys and values into a lower-dimensional space using learned projection matrices.\n  - **Reformer** also employs locality-sensitive hashing to reduce attention complexity to O(N log N), enabling the processing of longer sequences with reduced memory usage.\n\n## Adaptive Layer Normalization\n\n- **Dynamic Normalization**: Adaptive layer normalization techniques adjust normalization parameters based on the input context, enhancing model flexibility and performance. For instance, applying layer normalization after the QKV layer and removing pre-normalization, or combining QK layer normalization with softmax capping, can improve training stability and increase the learning rate without divergence.\n  - **Style Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN)** in the RealFormer model demonstrates significant performance improvements by adapting normalization parameters to the input features, which can be a valuable approach for the GAU block.\n\n## Hierarchical Normalization Structures\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: Implementing hierarchical normalization structures can help capture multi-scale dependencies. While the sources do not explicitly discuss hierarchical normalization within the context of GAU blocks, the concept of applying layer normalization at multiple stages (e.g., after QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers) can be seen as a form of hierarchical normalization, which can improve training stability and model performance.\n\n## Efficient Training and Scalability\n\n- **Layer Normalization Placement**: Careful placement of layer normalization is crucial for large models. Applying layer normalization after the QKV layer and other linear layers can improve training stability and allow for higher learning rates without divergence.\n  - **Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism**: Techniques like data parallelism, intra-layer model parallelism, and asynchronous parallel linear operations can significantly enhance training efficiency and scalability for large transformer models.\n\n## Empirical Evidence and Implementations\n\n- **Empirical Studies**: Studies on Linformer, Reformer, and other efficient attention mechanisms provide empirical evidence that these methods can match or exceed the performance of traditional MHA while being more resource-efficient.\n  - **Real-World Implementations**: The RealFormer model, which uses SALN and Location-based Multi-head Attention, shows improvements over traditional architectures, indicating the potential benefits of integrating such techniques into the GAU block.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Integrate Linear Attention**:\n   - Use linear attention mechanisms like those in Linformer or Reformer to reduce the computational complexity of MHA, allowing for more efficient processing of longer sequences.\n\n2. **Adaptive Normalization**:\n   - Implement adaptive layer normalization techniques, such as those described in the recent work on layer normalization after QKV layers and combining with softmax capping, to enhance model flexibility and performance.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Normalization**:\n   - Apply layer normalization at multiple stages within the transformer block to capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability.\n\n4. **Efficient Training Techniques**:\n   - Utilize advanced training techniques like data parallelism, intra-layer model parallelism, and asynchronous parallel linear operations to enhance training efficiency and scalability.\n\n5. **Empirical Validation**:\n   - Refer to empirical studies and real-world implementations to validate the effectiveness of these techniques in improving model performance and efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these advancements, the researcher can design a novel GAU block that not only outperforms existing models but also offers improved efficiency, scalability, and robustness.\n",

Linear attention variants like Linformer, Reformer, and SEA demonstrate that it's possible to reduce this complexity to linear or log-linear without significant performance degradation. The proposed \"The Devil in Linear Transformer\" identifies that scaling in attention matrices leads to gradient instability and proposes normalization to stabilize gradients, addressing two major issues in linear transformers: unbounded gradients and attention dilution.\n\n   - **Adaptive Layer Normalization**: RMSNorm offers computational efficiency but lacks adaptability. Recent advancements like AdaNorm and SALN introduce dynamic scaling and shifting parameters that adjust based on input context, enhancing model flexibility and performance. These methods replace static normalization parameters with functions that can adaptively modify normalization based on input features, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize across varied contexts.\n\n   - **Hierarchical Normalization Structures**: Applying normalization at multiple stages within the transformer layers, such as after QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers, can capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability. Hierarchical approaches like LaPE introduce independent layer normalization for token and position embeddings, allowing for adaptive scaling of positional information which enhances the model's capability to handle complex sequence structures.\n\n   - **Efficient Attention Implementations**: Methods like Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA) focus on reducing the redundancy and computational overhead of traditional MHA by introducing gating mechanisms and dynamic composition of attention heads. These approaches not only enhance computational efficiency but also maintain or even improve model expressiveness.\n\n   - **Empirical Performance**: Several studies demonstrate that integrating linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding traditional MHA models while being more computationally efficient. For instance, SEA achieves better perplexity than the OPT-1.3B baseline with reduced memory usage, and LaPE shows significant performance improvements across multiple vision tasks without incurring additional computational costs.\n\n   - **Implementation Considerations**: Adapting attention mechanisms and normalization methods requires careful architectural design to ensure seamless integration and maintenance of training stability. Techniques like data parallelism, intra-layer model parallelism, and asynchronous operations can further enhance the training efficiency and scalability of the proposed GAU enhancements.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps**\n\n   To further develop and refine the novel GAU block, the following steps are planned:\n\n   1. **Explore Advanced Linear Attention Variants**:\n      - Investigate additional linear attention mechanisms like Performer, Funnel-Transformer, and their respective enhancements to identify the most effective strategies for integration into GAUs.\n   \n   2. **Deep Dive into Adaptive and Hierarchical Normalization**:\n      - Study the mechanisms and benefits of AdaNorm, SALN, and LaPE to understand how adaptive and hierarchical normalization can be seamlessly integrated into the GAU architecture.\n      - Analyze the impact of normalization placement within the transformer layers to optimize training stability and model performance.\n   \n   3. **Hybrid and Modular GAU Architectures**:\n      - Develop modular GAU designs that allow for the combination of linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques.\n      - Experiment with hierarchical structures where layer normalization is applied at multiple stages to capture multi-scale dependencies.\n   \n   4. **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**:\n      - Conduct extensive experiments comparing the enhanced GAU blocks against traditional MHA and RMSNorm implementations across various tasks, including language modeling, text classification, and sequence generation.\n      - Utilize benchmarks from sources like Long-Range Arena and GLUE to measure performance improvements.\n   \n   5. **Scalability and Hardware Efficiency**:\n      - Investigate how the proposed GAU enhancements perform on different hardware architectures, ensuring that they are optimized for both training and inference phases.\n      - Explore implementation optimizations to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput, potentially leveraging parallel and distributed computing techniques.\n   \n   6. **Address Redundancy in Attention Heads**:\n      - Incorporate strategies from DCMHA and Pit One Against Many to reduce redundancy in attention heads, enhancing computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n   \n   7. **Iterative Refinement Based on Feedback**:\n      - Continuously refine the GAU design based on empirical results and feedback from benchmarking studies.\n      - Incorporate additional insights from ongoing research in transformer optimizations and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n5. **List of References**\n\n1.

Linear attention variants like Linformer, Reformer, and SEA demonstrate that it's possible to reduce this complexity to linear or log-linear without significant performance degradation. The proposed \"The Devil in Linear Transformer\" identifies that scaling in attention matrices leads to gradient instability and proposes normalization to stabilize gradients, addressing two major issues in linear transformers: unbounded gradients and attention dilution.\n\n   - **Adaptive Layer Normalization**: RMSNorm offers computational efficiency but lacks adaptability. Recent advancements like AdaNorm and SALN introduce dynamic scaling and shifting parameters that adjust based on input context, enhancing model flexibility and performance. These methods replace static normalization parameters with functions that can adaptively modify normalization based on input features, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize across varied contexts.\n\n   - **Hierarchical Normalization Structures**: Applying normalization at multiple stages within the transformer layers, such as after QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers, can capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability. Hierarchical approaches like LaPE introduce independent layer normalization for token and position embeddings, allowing for adaptive scaling of positional information which enhances the model's capability to handle complex sequence structures.\n\n   - **Efficient Attention Implementations**: Methods like Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA) focus on reducing the redundancy and computational overhead of traditional MHA by introducing gating mechanisms and dynamic composition of attention heads. These approaches not only enhance computational efficiency but also maintain or even improve model expressiveness.\n\n   - **Empirical Performance**: Several studies demonstrate that integrating linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding traditional MHA models while being more computationally efficient. For instance, SEA achieves better perplexity than the OPT-1.3B baseline with reduced memory usage, and LaPE shows significant performance improvements across multiple vision tasks without incurring additional computational costs.\n\n   - **Implementation Considerations**: Adapting attention mechanisms and normalization methods requires careful architectural design to ensure seamless integration and maintenance of training stability. Techniques like data parallelism, intra-layer model parallelism, and asynchronous operations can further enhance the training efficiency and scalability of the proposed GAU enhancements.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps**\n\n   To further develop and refine the novel GAU block, the following steps are planned:\n\n   1. **Explore Advanced Linear Attention Variants**:\n      - Investigate additional linear attention mechanisms like Performer, Funnel-Transformer, and their respective enhancements to identify the most effective strategies for integration into GAUs.\n   \n   2. **Deep Dive into Adaptive and Hierarchical Normalization**:\n      - Study the mechanisms and benefits of AdaNorm, SALN, and LaPE to understand how adaptive and hierarchical normalization can be seamlessly integrated into the GAU architecture.\n      - Analyze the impact of normalization placement within the transformer layers to optimize training stability and model performance.\n   \n   3. **Hybrid and Modular GAU Architectures**:\n      - Develop modular GAU designs that allow for the combination of linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques.\n      - Experiment with hierarchical structures where layer normalization is applied at multiple stages to capture multi-scale dependencies.\n   \n   4. **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**:\n      - Conduct extensive experiments comparing the enhanced GAU blocks against traditional MHA and RMSNorm implementations across various tasks, including language modeling, text classification, and sequence generation.\n      - Utilize benchmarks from sources like Long-Range Arena and GLUE to measure performance improvements.\n   \n   5. **Scalability and Hardware Efficiency**:\n      - Investigate how the proposed GAU enhancements perform on different hardware architectures, ensuring that they are optimized for both training and inference phases.\n      - Explore implementation optimizations to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput, potentially leveraging parallel and distributed computing techniques.\n   \n   6. **Address Redundancy in Attention Heads**:\n      - Incorporate strategies from DCMHA and Pit One Against Many to reduce redundancy in attention heads, enhancing computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n   \n   7. **Iterative Refinement Based on Feedback**:\n      - Continuously refine the GAU design based on empirical results and feedback from benchmarking studies.\n      - Incorporate additional insights from ongoing research in transformer optimizations and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n5. **List of References**\n\n1.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Score: 0.83)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Here are the most useful pieces of information and techniques that can be leveraged:\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Reducing Computational Complexity**: Traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) has quadratic complexity, which hinders scalability. Linear attention variants such as Linformer, Reformer, and SEA reduce this complexity to linear or log-linear without significant performance degradation.\n  - For example, the \"SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\" uses kernel-based linear attention and a top-k selection to create a sparse attention matrix, achieving better perplexity with reduced memory usage.\n\n### Adaptive and Hierarchical Normalization\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization**: Techniques like AdaNorm and Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) introduce dynamic scaling and shifting parameters that adjust based on input context, enhancing model flexibility and performance.\n  - AdaNorm replaces static normalization parameters with a new transformation function, improving adaptability.\n  - SALN uses adaptive layer normalization to better align the style of generated outputs with reference inputs.\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization**: Applying normalization at multiple stages within the transformer layers can capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability.\n  - LaPE introduces independent layer normalization for token and position embeddings, allowing adaptive scaling of positional information.\n\n### Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**: This mechanism is both expressive and hardware-efficient, reducing redundancy and computational overhead of traditional MHA.\n- **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**: This technique reduces computational costs by activating only a subset of experts for each input, similar to the approach in Time-MOE, which uses top-k routing and a shared expert for common knowledge.\n\n### Multi-Head Attention Optimizations\n\n- **Pit One Against Many**: This approach uses a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings to reduce redundancy in attention heads, enhancing computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n\n### Differential Attention\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: This architecture uses differential attention to eliminate attention noise by taking the difference between two softmax attention functions. It also employs multi-head differential attention and RMSNorm for normalization, which can improve model efficiency and stability.\n\n### Scalability and Hardware Efficiency\n\n- **Parallel and Distributed Computing**: Techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and data parallelism can enhance training efficiency and scalability. For instance, the ViT-22B model uses asynchronous parallel linear operations to minimize waiting time on incoming communication, increasing device efficiency.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Integrate Linear Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Explore and integrate linear attention variants like Performer, Funnel-Transformer, and SEA to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance.\n\n2. **Implement Adaptive and Hierarchical Normalization**:\n   - Incorporate AdaNorm, SALN, and LaPE to enhance model flexibility and performance by adapting normalization based on input context.\n\n3. **Use Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Implement GLA and MoE to reduce computational costs and enhance model expressiveness.\n\n4. **Optimize Multi-Head Attention**:\n   - Use strategies like \"Pit One Against Many\" to reduce redundancy in attention heads.\n\n5. **Leverage Differential Attention**:\n   - Consider the Differential Transformer architecture for its noise-canceling attention mechanism and efficient use of RMSNorm.\n\n6. **Ensure Scalability and Hardware Efficiency**:\n   - Optimize the model for different hardware architectures using techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations and data parallelism to ensure low latency and high throughput.\n\nBy combining these advanced techniques, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that is computationally efficient, scalable, and performs well across various tasks. Here are some specific references that can be particularly useful:\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: For its innovative differential attention mechanism and use of RMSNorm.\n- **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts**: For reducing computational costs by activating only a subset of experts.\n- **LaPE and AdaNorm**: For adaptive and hierarchical normalization techniques.\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**: For hardware-efficient training and reduced redundancy in attention heads.\n- **SEA and Performer**: For linear attention mechanisms with reduced computational complexity.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Linear attention variants like Linformer, Reformer, and SEA demonstrate that it's possible to reduce this complexity to linear or log-linear without significant performance degradation. The proposed \"The Devil in Linear Transformer\" identifies that scaling in attention matrices leads to gradient instability and proposes normalization to stabilize gradients, addressing two major issues in linear transformers: unbounded gradients and attention dilution.\n\n   - **Adaptive Layer Normalization**: RMSNorm offers computational efficiency but lacks adaptability. Recent advancements like AdaNorm and SALN introduce dynamic scaling and shifting parameters that adjust based on input context, enhancing model flexibility and performance. These methods replace static normalization parameters with functions that can adaptively modify normalization based on input features, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize across varied contexts.\n\n   - **Hierarchical Normalization Structures**: Applying normalization at multiple stages within the transformer layers, such as after QKV, Proj, and FC2 layers, can capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability. Hierarchical approaches like LaPE introduce independent layer normalization for token and position embeddings, allowing for adaptive scaling of positional information which enhances the model's capability to handle complex sequence structures.\n\n   - **Efficient Attention Implementations**: Methods like Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA) focus on reducing the redundancy and computational overhead of traditional MHA by introducing gating mechanisms and dynamic composition of attention heads. These approaches not only enhance computational efficiency but also maintain or even improve model expressiveness.\n\n   - **Empirical Performance**: Several studies demonstrate that integrating linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding traditional MHA models while being more computationally efficient. For instance, SEA achieves better perplexity than the OPT-1.3B baseline with reduced memory usage, and LaPE shows significant performance improvements across multiple vision tasks without incurring additional computational costs.\n\n   - **Implementation Considerations**: Adapting attention mechanisms and normalization methods requires careful architectural design to ensure seamless integration and maintenance of training stability. Techniques like data parallelism, intra-layer model parallelism, and asynchronous operations can further enhance the training efficiency and scalability of the proposed GAU enhancements.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps**\n\n   To further develop and refine the novel GAU block, the following steps are planned:\n\n   1. **Explore Advanced Linear Attention Variants**:\n      - Investigate additional linear attention mechanisms like Performer, Funnel-Transformer, and their respective enhancements to identify the most effective strategies for integration into GAUs.\n   \n   2. **Deep Dive into Adaptive and Hierarchical Normalization**:\n      - Study the mechanisms and benefits of AdaNorm, SALN, and LaPE to understand how adaptive and hierarchical normalization can be seamlessly integrated into the GAU architecture.\n      - Analyze the impact of normalization placement within the transformer layers to optimize training stability and model performance.\n   \n   3. **Hybrid and Modular GAU Architectures**:\n      - Develop modular GAU designs that allow for the combination of linear attention with adaptive normalization techniques.\n      - Experiment with hierarchical structures where layer normalization is applied at multiple stages to capture multi-scale dependencies.\n   \n   4. **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**:\n      - Conduct extensive experiments comparing the enhanced GAU blocks against traditional MHA and RMSNorm implementations across various tasks, including language modeling, text classification, and sequence generation.\n      - Utilize benchmarks from sources like Long-Range Arena and GLUE to measure performance improvements.\n   \n   5. **Scalability and Hardware Efficiency**:\n      - Investigate how the proposed GAU enhancements perform on different hardware architectures, ensuring that they are optimized for both training and inference phases.\n      - Explore implementation optimizations to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput, potentially leveraging parallel and distributed computing techniques.\n   \n   6. **Address Redundancy in Attention Heads**:\n      - Incorporate strategies from DCMHA and Pit One Against Many to reduce redundancy in attention heads, enhancing computational efficiency and model expressiveness.\n   \n   7. **Iterative Refinement Based on Feedback**:\n      - Continuously refine the GAU design based on empirical results and feedback from benchmarking studies.\n      - Incorporate additional insights from ongoing research in transformer optimizations and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n5. **List of References**\n\n1.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022. Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/30 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1803.07416, 2018.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical layer normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical layer normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

This paper investigates the memorization abilities of multi-head attention mechanisms, examining how many example sequences they can memorize, as a function of the number of heads and sequence length. Motivated by experimental findings on vision transformers, we introduce novel assumptions about the linear independence of input data, distinct from the commonly used general-position assumption. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate that an attention layer with $H$ heads, dimension $d$, and context size $n<d$, featuring $\\Theta(Hd^2)$ parameters, can memorize $\\Omega(Hn)$ examples. Our analysis sheds light on how different attention heads handle various example sequences, aided by the softmax operator's saturation property.

Interpreting and Exploiting Functional Specialization in Multi-Head Attention under Multi-task Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Chong Li, Shaonan Wang, Yunhao Zhang, Jiajun Zhang, Chengqing Zong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on seven pre-trained transformer models have demonstrated that multi-head attention does evolve functional specialization phenomenon after multi-task training which is affected by the similarity of tasks, and an interpreting method is introduced to quantify the degree of functional specialization in multi- head attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models, even though achieving super-human performance on several downstream tasks, are often regarded as a black box and used as a whole. It is still unclear what mechanisms they have learned, especially their core module: multi-head attention. Inspired by functional specialization in the human brain, which helps to efficiently handle multiple tasks, this work attempts to figure out whether the multi-head attention module will evolve similar function separation under multi-tasking training. If it is, can this mechanism further improve the model performance? To investigate these questions, we introduce an interpreting method to quantify the degree of functional specialization in multi-head attention. We further propose a simple multi-task training method to increase functional specialization and mitigate negative information transfer in multi-task learning. Experimental results on seven pre-trained transformer models have demonstrated that multi-head attention does evolve functional specialization phenomenon after multi-task training which is affected by the similarity of tasks. Moreover, the multi-task training strategy based on functional specialization boosts performance in both multi-task learning and transfer learning without adding any parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism. We propose an alternative module that uses only a single shared projection matrix and multiple head embeddings (MHE), i.e. one per head. We empirically demonstrate that our MHE attention is substantially more memory efficient compared to alternative attention mechanisms while achieving high predictive performance retention ratio to vanilla MHA on several downstream tasks. MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. ImageBART: Bidirectional Context with Multinomial Diffusion for Autoregressive Image Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention enhancements for autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Patrick Esser, Robin Rombach, A. Blattmann, B. Ommer*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting autoregressive ImageBART model can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training and can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage, the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 136  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Methods of improving LLM training stability\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical layer normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Oleg Rybakov, Mike Chrzanowski, Peter Dykas, Jinze Xue, Ben Lanir*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research\ntopic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Unveiling and Harnessing Hidden Attention Sinks: Enhancing Large\n  Language Models without Training through Attention Calibration\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zhongzhi Yu, Zheng Wang, Yonggan Fu, Huihong Shi, Khalid Shaikh, Yingyan Celine Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a fundamental component behind the remarkable achievements of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, our current understanding of the\nattention mechanism, especially regarding how attention distributions are\nestablished, remains limited. Inspired by recent studies that explore the\npresence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives\ndisproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic\nimportance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a\nmore profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and\nto uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly\noptimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning.\nSpecifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the\nattention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and\ntasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of\nsequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention\nsinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon\nour findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT)\nthat automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during\ninference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT\nconsistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different\napplications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to 7.30%\nin accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More\n  Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention enhancements for autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Yingyan Celine Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive\nperformance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1)\nquadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases,\nand (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of\nautoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative\ndecoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic\npotential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the\nfirst comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods\nfor autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We\nintroduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures\ncompatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and\nserving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven\nexisting linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs\nconsistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs.\nNotably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the\nLLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior\nlinear attention methods.

LeaPformer: Enabling Linear Transformers for Autoregressive and\n  Simultaneous Tasks via Learned Proportions\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention enhancements for autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Victor Agostinelli, Sanghyun Hong, Lizhong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A promising approach to preserving model performance in linearized\ntransformers is to employ position-based re-weighting functions. However,\nstate-of-the-art re-weighting functions rely heavily on target sequence\nlengths, making it difficult or impossible to apply them to autoregressive and\nsimultaneous tasks, where the target and sometimes even the input sequence\nlength are unknown. To address this issue, we propose Learned Proportions\n(LeaP) and LeaPformers. Our contribution is built on two major components.\nFirst, we generalize the dependence on explicit positional representations and\nsequence lengths into dependence on sequence proportions for re-weighting.\nSecond, we replace static positional representations with dynamic proportions\nderived via a compact module, enabling more flexible attention concentration\npatterns. We evaluate LeaPformer against eight representative efficient\ntransformers on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, showing that LeaPformer\nachieves the best quality-throughput trade-off, as well as LeaPformer to\nWikitext-103 autoregressive language modeling and simultaneous speech-to-text\ntranslation for two language pairs, achieving competitive results.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-18T22:23:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-18T22:23:07Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical layer normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. 3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical layer normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Bennett A. Landman, Yuankai Huo, Shunxing Bao, Ho Hin Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Neural Speech Synthesis with Transformer Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Ming Zhou, Sheng Zhao, Naihan Li, Shujie Liu, Yanqing Liu, Ming Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Although end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) methods (such as Tacotron2)\nare proposed and achieve state-of-the-art performance, they still suffer from\ntwo problems: 1) low efficiency during training and inference; 2) hard to model\nlong dependency using current recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Inspired by the\nsuccess of Transformer network in neural machine translation (NMT), in this\npaper, we introduce and adapt the multi-head attention mechanism to replace the\nRNN structures and also the original attention mechanism in Tacotron2. With the\nhelp of multi-head self-attention, the hidden states in the encoder and decoder\nare constructed in parallel, which improves the training efficiency. Meanwhile,\nany two inputs at different times are connected directly by self-attention\nmechanism, which solves the long range dependency problem effectively. Using\nphoneme sequences as input, our Transformer TTS network generates mel\nspectrograms, followed by a WaveNet vocoder to output the final audio results.\nExperiments are conducted to test the efficiency and performance of our new\nnetwork. For the efficiency, our Transformer TTS network can speed up the\ntraining about 4.25 times faster compared with Tacotron2. For the performance,\nrigorous human tests show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (outperforms Tacotron2 with a gap of 0.048) and is very close to\nhuman quality (4.39 vs 4.44 in MOS).\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 4. Real-time Attention Based Look-alike Model for Recommender System\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yudan Liu, Kaikai Ge, Xu Zhang, Leyu Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, deep learning models play more and more important roles in contents recommender systems. However, although the performance of recommendations is greatly improved, the \"Matthew effect\" becomes increasingly evident. While the head contents get more and more popular, many competitive long-tail contents are difficult to achieve timely exposure because of lacking behavior features. This issue has badly impacted the quality and diversity of recommendations. To solve this problem, look-alike algorithm is a good choice to extend audience for high quality long-tail contents. But the traditional look-alike models which widely used in online advertising are not suitable for recommender systems because of the strict requirement of both real-time and effectiveness. This paper introduces a real-time attention based look-alike model (RALM) for recommender systems, which tackles the challenge of conflict between real-time and effectiveness. RALM realizes real-time look-alike audience extension benefiting from seeds-to-user similarity prediction and improves the effectiveness through optimizing user representation learning and look-alike learning modeling. For user representation learning, we propose a novel neural network structure named attention merge layer to replace the concatenation layer, which significantly improves the expressive ability of multi-fields feature learning. On the other hand, considering the various members of seeds, we design global attention unit and local attention unit to learn robust and adaptive seeds representation with respect to a certain target user. At last, we introduce seeds clustering mechanism which not only reduces the time complexity of attention units prediction but also minimizes the loss of seeds information at the same time. According to our experiments, RALM shows superior effectiveness and performance than popular look-alike models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. Neural Image Compression via Non-Local Attention Optimization and Improved Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention enhancements for autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yao Wang, Xun Cao, Haojie Liu, Tong Chen, Qiu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel Non-Local Attention optmization and Improved Context modeling-based image compression (NLAIC) algorithm, which is built on top of the deep nerual network (DNN)-based variational auto-encoder (VAE) structure. Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, we need to focus on several key areas: hierarchical layer normalization, adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms, and linear attention enhancements.\n\n### Hierarchical Layer Normalization\n\n1. **Layer-Adaptive Position Embedding (LaPE):**\n   - This technique introduces independent layer normalization for token embeddings and position embeddings, allowing adaptive scaling of positional information across layers. This approach can capture multi-scale dependencies and improve training stability, especially in deep transformer architectures.\n\n2. **Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm and SALN):**\n   - These methods replace static normalization parameters with dynamic transformation functions that adjust based on the input context. AdaNorm and Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) enhance model flexibility and performance, particularly in handling diverse and context-dependent inputs.\n\n3. **Dynamic Layer Normalization:**\n   - This approach generates scaling and shifting parameters based on input features, enhancing adaptability in neural acoustic modeling and potentially in language models as well.\n\n### Adaptive Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Pit One Against Many:**\n   - This strategy uses a single shared projection matrix with multiple head embeddings, reducing redundancy across attention heads and enhancing parameter efficiency. This method streamlines computations and makes the model more scalable and faster during inference.\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention (GLA):**\n   - GLA combines gating mechanisms with linear attention to balance expressiveness and computational efficiency. This approach reduces redundancy in attention heads, leading to faster computations without sacrificing model performance.\n\n3. **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE):**\n   - By activating only a subset of experts per input, MoE significantly cuts down computational costs while maintaining or enhancing expressiveness. This is particularly beneficial in large-scale models where full multi-head attention would be prohibitively expensive.\n\n### Linear Attention Enhancements\n\n1. **Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask (SEA):**\n   - SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention and then creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection. This approach ensures the model maintains focus on salient tokens, improving both performance and computational efficiency.\n\n2. **Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention:**\n   - This work shows that linearized transformer models can dramatically accelerate autoregressive transformers by revealing their relationship to recurrent neural networks. This formulation permits an iterative implementation that is more efficient.\n\n3. **The Devil in Linear Transformer:**\n   - This study identifies the scaling of attention matrices as a source of gradient instability in linear attention and proposes a new linear attention that replaces scaling with normalization to stabilize gradients.\n\n### Empirical Studies and Implementations\n\n- **SEA and LaPE:** These studies demonstrate that integrating linear attention mechanisms with adaptive normalization techniques can achieve performance on par with or superior to traditional multi-head attention configurations, all while being more computationally efficient and memory-friendly.\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers:** These models have been shown to be both expressive and hardware-efficient, making them suitable for large-scale language models.\n\n### Implementation Considerations and Optimization\n\n- **Gradient Stability and Training Dynamics:** Ensuring seamless information flow and maintaining training stability are crucial when integrating advanced attention and normalization techniques. Techniques like gradient clipping, adaptive learning rates, and modular design can alleviate potential integration issues.\n\n- **Parallel and Distributed Computing:** Implementing asynchronous parallel linear operations and data parallelism can further enhance training efficiency and scalability. Techniques like those used in Vision Transformers highlight the importance of optimizing communication overheads to maximize hardware utilization.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Hierarchical Normalization:**\n   - Investigate recent advancements in hierarchical layer normalization to understand how multi-scale normalization can enhance feature representation and training stability.\n\n2. **Explore Adaptive Multi-Head Attention:**\n   - Examine studies on adaptive multi-head attention that dynamically adjust attention distributions based on input context, focusing on methods that improve flexibility and performance.\n\n3. **Integrate Linear Attention Enhancements:**\n   - Look into the latest linear attention enhancements, particularly those compatible with autoregressive decoding, to enhance computational efficiency and scalability.\n\n4. **Empirical Validation:**\n   - Implement the proposed enhancements and evaluate their performance against traditional multi-head attention and RMSNorm configurations using benchmarks like Long-Range Arena and GLUE.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and leveraging the insights from the mentioned studies, the researcher can develop a novel GAU block that significantly enhances the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n",

Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.96)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05457, 2018.

Towards Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection via Hierarchical Congruity Modeling with Knowledge Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Hui Liu, Wenya Wang, Hao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel hierarchical framework for sarcasm detection by exploring both the atomic- level congruity based on multi-head cross attentions and the composition-level congruities based on graph neural networks, where a post with low congruITY can be identified as sarcasm.\n\n**Abstract:** Sarcasm is a linguistic phenomenon indicating a discrepancy between literal meanings and implied intentions. Due to its sophisticated nature, it is usually difficult to be detected from the text itself. As a result, multi-modal sarcasm detection has received more and more attention in both academia and industries. However, most existing techniques only modeled the atomic-level inconsistencies between the text input and its accompanying image, ignoring more complex compositions for both modalities. Moreover, they neglected the rich information contained in external knowledge, e.g., image captions. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for sarcasm detection by exploring both the atomic-level congruity based on multi-head cross attentions and the composition-level congruity based on graph neural networks, where a post with low congruity can be identified as sarcasm. In addition, we exploit the effect of various knowledge resources for sarcasm detection. Evaluation results on a public multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset based on Twitter demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 44  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Dialog-Post: Multi-Level Self-Supervised Objectives and Hierarchical Model for Dialogue Post-Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Zhenyu Zhang, Lei Shen, Yuming Zhao, Meng Chen, Xiao-feng He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A DialPost method, Dialog-Post, with multi-level self-supervised objectives and a hierarchical model that outperforms existing SOTA models and achieves a 3.3% improvement on average.\n\n**Abstract:** Dialogue representation and understanding aim to convert conversational inputs into embeddings and fulfill discriminative tasks. Compared with free-form text, dialogue has two important characteristics, hierarchical semantic structure and multi-facet attributes. Therefore, directly applying the pretrained language models (PLMs) might result in unsatisfactory performance. Recently, several work focused on the dialogue-adaptive post-training (DialPost) that further trains PLMs to fit dialogues. To model dialogues more comprehensively, we propose a DialPost method, Dialog-Post, with multi-level self-supervised objectives and a hierarchical model. These objectives leverage dialogue-specific attributes and use self-supervised signals to fully facilitate the representation and understanding of dialogues. The novel model is a hierarchical segment-wise self-attention network, which contains inner-segment and inter-segment self-attention sub-layers followed by an aggregation and updating module. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we first apply two public datasets for the verification of representation ability. Then we conduct experiments on a newly-labelled dataset that is annotated with 4 dialogue understanding tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing SOTA models and achieves a 3.3% improvement on average.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Masked Autoencoders with Multi-Window Local-Global Attention Are Better Audio Learners\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Sarthak Yadav, S. Theodoridis, Lars Kai Hansen, Z. Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** Analyzing attention head feature representations through Projection Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) shows that attention heads with the same window sizes across the decoder layers of the MW-MAE learn correlated feature representations which enables each block to independently capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled decoder feature hierarchy.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a Multi-Window Masked Autoencoder (MW-MAE) fitted with a novel Multi-Window Multi-Head Attention (MW-MHA) module that facilitates the modelling of local-global interactions in every decoder transformer block through attention heads of several distinct local and global windows. Empirical results on ten downstream audio tasks show that MW-MAEs consistently outperform standard MAEs in overall performance and learn better general-purpose audio representations, along with demonstrating considerably better scaling characteristics. Investigating attention distances and entropies reveals that MW-MAE encoders learn heads with broader local and global attention. Analyzing attention head feature representations through Projection Weighted Canonical Correlation Analysis (PWCCA) shows that attention heads with the same window sizes across the decoder layers of the MW-MAE learn correlated feature representations which enables each block to independently capture local and global information, leading to a decoupled decoder feature hierarchy. Code for feature extraction and downstream experiments along with pre-trained models will be released publically.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

NDH-Full: Learning and Evaluating Navigational Agents on Full-Length Dialogue\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Hyounghun Kim, Jialu Li, Mohit Bansal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper explores the Navigation from Dialogue History (NDH) task, presents a state-of-the-art model which is built upon Vision-Language transformers, and proposes a new task setup called NDH-Full which takes the full dialogue and the whole navigation path as one instance.\n\n**Abstract:** Communication between human and mobile agents is getting increasingly important as such agents are widely deployed in our daily lives. Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation is one of the tasks that evaluate the agent\u2019s ability to interact with humans for assistance and navigate based on natural language responses. In this paper, we explore the Navigation from Dialogue History (NDH) task, which is based on the Cooperative Vision-and-Dialogue Navigation (CVDN) dataset, and present a state-of-the-art model which is built upon Vision-Language transformers. However, despite achieving competitive performance, we find that the agent in the NDH task is not evaluated appropriately by the primary metric \u2013 Goal Progress. By analyzing the performance mismatch between Goal Progress and other metrics (e.g., normalized Dynamic Time Warping) from our state-of-the-art model, we show that NDH\u2019s sub-path based task setup (i.e., navigating partial trajectory based on its correspondent subset of the full dialogue) does not provide the agent with enough supervision signal towards the goal region. Therefore, we propose a new task setup called NDH-Full which takes the full dialogue and the whole navigation path as one instance. We present a strong baseline model and show initial results on this new task. We further describe several approaches that we try, in order to improve the model performance (based on curriculum learning, pre-training, and data-augmentation), suggesting potential useful training methods on this new NDH-Full task.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Global Filter Networks for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Zheng Zhu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Global Filter Network is presented, a conceptually simple yet computationally efficient architecture that learns long-term spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity and can be a very competitive alternative to transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in self-attention and pure multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) models for vision have shown great potential in achieving promising performance with fewer inductive biases. These models are generally based on learning interaction among spatial locations from raw data. The complexity of self-attention and MLP grows quadratically as the image size increases, which makes these models hard to scale up when high-resolution features are required. In this paper, we present the Global Filter Network (GFNet), a conceptually simple yet computationally efficient architecture, that learns long-term spatial dependencies in the frequency domain with log-linear complexity. Our architecture replaces the self-attention layer in vision transformers with three key operations: a 2D discrete Fourier transform, an element-wise multiplication between frequency-domain features and learnable global filters, and a 2D inverse Fourier transform. We exhibit favorable accuracy/complexity trade-offs of our models on both ImageNet and downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate that GFNet can be a very competitive alternative to transformer-style models and CNNs in efficiency, generalization ability and robustness.

A Hierarchical Transformer for Unsupervised Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Ashok Thillaisundaram*\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying structure of natural language is hierarchical; words combine\ninto phrases, which in turn form clauses. An awareness of this hierarchical\nstructure can aid machine learning models in performing many linguistic tasks.\nHowever, most such models just process text sequentially and there is no bias\ntowards learning hierarchical structure encoded into their architecture. In\nthis paper, we extend the recent transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by\nenabling it to learn hierarchical representations. To achieve this, we adapt\nthe ordering mechanism introduced in Shen et al., 2018, to the self-attention\nmodule of the transformer architecture. We train our new model on language\nmodelling and then apply it to the task of unsupervised parsing. We achieve\nreasonable results on the freely available subset of the WSJ10 dataset with an\nF1-score of about 50%.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-30T22:07:22Z  (*Updated: 2020-03-30T22:07:22Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Read, Highlight and Summarize: A Hierarchical Neural Semantic\n  Encoder-based Approach\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Rajeev Bhatt Ambati, Saptarashmi Bandyopadhyay, Prasenjit Mitra*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models and other variations of the\nattention-mechanism such as hierarchical attention have been applied to the\ntext summarization problem. Though there is a hierarchy in the way humans use\nlanguage by forming paragraphs from sentences and sentences from words,\nhierarchical models have usually not worked that much better than their\ntraditional seq2seq counterparts. This effect is mainly because either the\nhierarchical attention mechanisms are too sparse using hard attention or noisy\nusing soft attention. In this paper, we propose a method based on extracting\nthe highlights of a document; a key concept that is conveyed in a few\nsentences. In a typical text summarization dataset consisting of documents that\nare 800 tokens in length (average), capturing long-term dependencies is very\nimportant, e.g., the last sentence can be grouped with the first sentence of a\ndocument to form a summary. LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory) proved useful for\nmachine translation. However, they often fail to capture long-term dependencies\nwhile modeling long sequences. To address these issues, we have adapted Neural\nSemantic Encoders (NSE) to text summarization, a class of memory-augmented\nneural networks by improving its functionalities and proposed a novel\nhierarchical NSE that outperforms similar previous models significantly. The\nquality of summarization was improved by augmenting linguistic factors, namely\nlemma, and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags, to each word in the dataset for improved\nvocabulary coverage and generalization. The hierarchical NSE model on factored\ndataset outperformed the state-of-the-art by nearly 4 ROUGE points. We further\ndesigned and used the first GPU-based self-critical Reinforcement Learning\nmodel.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-08T02:36:02Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-01T04:54:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Clustering in pure-attention hardmax transformers and its role in\n  sentiment analysis\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Albert Alcalde, Giovanni Fantuzzi, Enrique Zuazua*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are extremely successful machine learning models whose\nmathematical properties remain poorly understood. Here, we rigorously\ncharacterize the behavior of transformers with hardmax self-attention and\nnormalization sublayers as the number of layers tends to infinity. By viewing\nsuch transformers as discrete-time dynamical systems describing the evolution\nof points in a Euclidean space, and thanks to a geometric interpretation of the\nself-attention mechanism based on hyperplane separation, we show that the\ntransformer inputs asymptotically converge to a clustered equilibrium\ndetermined by special points called leaders. We then leverage this theoretical\nunderstanding to solve sentiment analysis problems from language processing\nusing a fully interpretable transformer model, which effectively captures\n`context' by clustering meaningless words around leader words carrying the most\nmeaning. Finally, we outline remaining challenges to bridge the gap between the\nmathematical analysis of transformers and their real-life implementation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-26T16:13:35Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-26T16:13:35Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. PowerNorm: Rethinking Batch Normalization in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Sheng Shen, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer*\n\n**Abstract:** The standard normalization method for neural network (NN) models used in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is layer normalization (LN). This is\ndifferent than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer\nVision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical\nobservation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance\ndegradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying\nreasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic\nstudy of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as\ncompared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch\ndimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in\ninstability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power\nNormalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by\n(i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running\nquadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and\n(iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running\nstatistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions,\nthat PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN.\nFurthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to\nbounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP\ntasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN. In\nparticular, PN outperforms LN by 0.4/0.6 BLEU on IWSLT14/WMT14 and 5.6/3.0 PPL\non PTB/WikiText-103.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FastMask: Segment Multi-scale Object Candidates in One Shot\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention\"*\n\n*Zhimin Cao, Yuning Jiang, Shiyi Lan, Hexiang Hu, Fei Sha*\n\n**Abstract:** Objects appear to scale differently in natural images. This fact requires\nmethods dealing with object-centric tasks (e.g. object proposal) to have robust\nperformance over variances in object scales. In the paper, we present a novel\nsegment proposal framework, namely FastMask, which takes advantage of\nhierarchical features in deep convolutional neural networks to segment\nmulti-scale objects in one shot. Innovatively, we adapt segment proposal\nnetwork into three different functional components (body, neck and head). We\nfurther propose a weight-shared residual neck module as well as a\nscale-tolerant attentional head module for efficient one-shot inference. On MS\nCOCO benchmark, the proposed FastMask outperforms all state-of-the-art segment\nproposal methods in average recall being 2~5 times faster.

Although word embedding comes in handy to support downstream tasks for low-resource languages, there are plenty of scopes in improving the quality of language representation particularly for code-mixed languages. In this paper, we propose HIT, a robust representation learning method for code-mixed texts. HIT is a hierarchical transformer-based framework that captures the semantic relationship among words and hierarchically learns the sentence-level semantics using a fused attention mechanism. HIT incorporates two attention modules, a multi-headed self-attention and an outer product attention module, and computes their weighted sum to obtain the attention weights. Our evaluation of HIT on one European (Spanish) and five Indic (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam) languages across four NLP tasks on eleven datasets suggests significant performance improvement against various state-of-the-art systems. We further show the adaptability of learned representation across tasks in a transfer learning setup (with and without fine-tuning).\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Ping Luo, Ying Shan, Xiaogang Wang, Xuyuan Xu, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yixiao Ge, Wenqi Shao*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Conference:** dynamic-token-normalization-improves-vision\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic normalization in transformers\"*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Shiyu Chang, Yifan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful \"universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details.

EfficientViT: Multi-Scale Linear Attention for High-Resolution Dense Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Chuang Gan, Junyan Li, Muyan Hu, Song Han, Han Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** High-resolution dense prediction enables many appealing real-world applications, such as computational photography, autonomous driving, etc. However, the vast computational cost makes deploying state-of-the-art high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices difficult. This work presents EfficientViT, a new family of high-resolution vision models with novel multi-scale linear attention. Unlike prior high-resolution dense prediction models that rely on heavy softmax attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topology structure to obtain good performances, our multi-scale linear attention achieves the global receptive field and multi-scale learning (two desirable features for high-resolution dense prediction) with only lightweight and hardware-efficient operations. As such, EfficientViT delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art models with significant speedup on diverse hardware platforms, including mobile CPU, edge GPU, and cloud GPU. Without performance loss on Cityscapes, our EfficientViT provides up to 13.9$\\times$ and 6.2$\\times$ GPU latency reduction over SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively. For super-resolution, EfficientViT delivers up to 6.4x speedup over Restormer while providing 0.11dB gain in PSNR. For Segment Anything, EfficientViT delivers 48.9x higher throughput on A100 GPU while achieving slightly better zero-shot instance segmentation performance on COCO.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale linear attention\"*\n\n*Tomas Pfister, Sercan O. Arik, Nate Yoder, Chun-Liang Li, Si-An Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world time-series datasets are often multivariate with complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, high capacity architectures like recurrent- or attention-based sequential deep learning models have become popular. However, recent work demonstrates that simple univariate linear models can outperform such deep learning models on several commonly used academic benchmarks. Extending them, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of linear models for time-series forecasting and present Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), a novel architecture designed by stacking multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). TSMixer is based on mixing operations along both the time and feature dimensions to extract information efficiently. On popular academic benchmarks, the simple-to-implement TSMixer is comparable to specialized state-of-the-art models that leverage the inductive biases of specific benchmarks. On the challenging and large scale M5 benchmark, a real-world retail dataset, TSMixer demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our results underline the importance of efficiently utilizing cross-variate and auxiliary information for improving the performance of time series forecasting. We present various analyses to shed light into the capabilities of TSMixer. The design paradigms utilized in TSMixer are expected to open new horizons for deep learning-based time series forecasting. The implementation is available at https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/tsmixer\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms with dynamic normalization techniques, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-Head Attention\n\n1. **Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)**\n   - The DAAM, as described in the paper on \"Robust Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities,\" uses a multi-head framework with learnable mean and variance to dynamically adjust attention.

Hierarchical normalization ensures that positional information is adaptively scaled across different layers, while adaptive attention dynamically modulates attention distributions based on input contexts. This combination enhances both the expressiveness and efficiency of GAUs, making them more capable of handling long and complex sequences without incurring prohibitive computational costs.\n\n   - **Gradient Stability through Dynamic Normalization:**\n     Replacing scaling operations in linear attention mechanisms with dynamic normalization techniques (e.g., Dynamic Layer Normalization as proposed by Mahdavi et al.) addresses gradient stability issues inherent in linear transformers. This stabilization is crucial for training deep transformer models, ensuring that gradients do not explode or vanish, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient training processes.\n\n   - **Parameter and Computational Efficiency:**\n     Strategies like Sparse Mixture-of-Experts and Pit One Against Many significantly reduce the redundancy in multi-head attention by limiting the number of active attention heads per input. When combined with hierarchical adaptive normalization, these methods contribute to considerable improvements in computational efficiency and memory usage, allowing for the scaling of transformer models to larger sizes without a proportional increase in resource requirements.\n\n   - **Multi-Scale Feature Representation:**\n     Hierarchical and multi-scale normalization and attention mechanisms enable the model to process information at various granularities. This is particularly beneficial for autoregressive language models, which must generate and comprehend long and complex sequences. Multi-scale attention allows the model to focus on both local and global dependencies, enhancing its ability to maintain coherence over extended contexts.\n\n   - **Empirical Performance Enhancements:**\n     Empirical studies indicate that integrating hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention with dynamic normalization not only maintains but can also improve model performance on standard benchmarks. Techniques like LaPE and GLA have demonstrated superiority over traditional MHA and RMSNorm configurations, achieving lower perplexity scores and better generalization across tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and image synthesis.\n\n   - **Implementation Considerations:**\n     The proposed integration requires meticulous architectural design to ensure seamless interaction between hierarchical normalization layers and adaptive attention mechanisms. Potential challenges include maintaining training stability, optimizing the order of operations to maximize the benefits of each component, and ensuring compatibility with existing transformer-based architectures. Techniques such as gradient clipping, adaptive learning rates, and modular design approaches are essential to address these challenges effectively.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps**\n\n   To further refine and enhance the proposed GAU block, the following steps are planned:\n\n   1. **Deep Dive into Specific Adaptive Normalization Techniques:**\n      - Investigate the detailed mechanisms of AdaNorm and SALN to understand their integration with multi-head attention. Explore how these adaptive normalization techniques can be extended or modified for hierarchical settings.\n   \n   2. **Examine Combined Hierarchical and Adaptive Multi-Head Attention:**\n      - Research hybrid attention mechanisms that incorporate both hierarchical structuring and dynamic adaptation.

Conduct empirical tests comparing performance and efficiency against traditional MHA and RMSNorm-based GAUs on standard benchmarks like Long-Range Arena and GLUE.\n   \n   4. **Address Training Stability and Gradient Flow:**\n      - Explore optimization techniques such as gradient clipping, adaptive learning rates, and advanced weight initialization strategies to maintain training stability in the presence of hierarchical and adaptive components.\n   \n   5. **Scalability and Hardware Optimization:**\n      - Research how the proposed GAU enhancements perform on different hardware architectures, and optimize for both training and inference efficiency. Explore parallelization and distributed computing strategies to handle large-scale language models.\n   \n   6. **Explore Further Efficiency Enhancements:**\n      - Investigate additional parameter-efficient strategies like Sparse MoE and their potential integration with adaptive normalization and hierarchical attention to further reduce memory and computational costs while maintaining or improving model performance.\n   \n   7. **Iterative Refinement Based on Feedback:**\n      - Continuously refine the GAU design based on empirical results and feedback from benchmarking studies. Incorporate additional insights from ongoing research in transformer optimizations and efficient attention mechanisms.\n   \n   By following this plan, the research will systematically build upon current advancements to develop a novel GAU block that effectively enhances computational efficiency, scalability, and model performance in autoregressive language models.\n\n5. **List of References**\n\n   1.

In this paper, we focus on length extrapolation, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating longer sequences. We define attention resolution as an indicator of extrapolation.

Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling.

As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 3. Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling for Memory Efficient Adaptation of Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization transformers*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Guanchu Wang, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, D. Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. SAViT: Structure-Aware Vision Transformer Pruning via Collaborative Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization transformers*\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Zheyang Li, Kai Zhang, Zhi Yang, Wenming Tan, Jun Xiao, Ye Ren, Shiliang Pu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Joint importance is introduced, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning in ViTs, and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) yield impressive performance across various vision tasks. However, heavy computation and memory footprint make them inaccessible for edge devices. Previous works apply importance criteria determined independently by each individual component to prune ViTs. Considering that heterogeneous components in ViTs play distinct roles, these approaches lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce joint importance, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning. Based on the theoretical analysis, we construct a Taylor-based approximation to evaluate the joint importance. This guides pruning toward a more balanced reduction across all components. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, we incorporate the interactions into the optimization function under some mild assumptions. Moreover, the proposed method can be seamlessly applied to various tasks including object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet, increasing accuracy by 0.7% over the DeiT-Base baseline while saving 50% FLOPs. On COCO, we are the first to show that 70% FLOPs of Faster R-CNN with ViT backbone can be removed with only 0.3% mAP drop.

To interpret the Transformer-based models, their attention patterns have been extensively analyzed. However, the Transformer architecture is not only composed of the multi-head attention; other components can also contribute to Transformers\u2019 progressive performance. In this study, we extended the scope of the analysis of Transformers from solely the attention patterns to the whole attention block, i.e., multi-head attention, residual connection, and layer normalization. Our analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed. These results provide new intuitive explanations of existing reports; for example, discarding the learned attention patterns tends not to adversely affect the performance.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: attention normalization empirical*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 9. Utilizing Character and Word Embeddings for Text Normalization with Sequence-to-Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: attention normalization empirical*\n\n*Daniel Watson, Nasser Zalmout, Nizar Habash*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that providing the model with word-level features bridges the gap for the neural network approach to achieve a state-of-the-art F1 score on a standard Arabic language correction shared task dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** Text normalization is an important enabling technology for several NLP tasks. Recently, neural-network-based approaches have outperformed well-established models in this task. However, in languages other than English, there has been little exploration in this direction. Both the scarcity of annotated data and the complexity of the language increase the difficulty of the problem. To address these challenges, we use a sequence-to-sequence model with character-based attention, which in addition to its self-learned character embeddings, uses word embeddings pre-trained with an approach that also models subword information. This provides the neural model with access to more linguistic information especially suitable for text normalization, without large parallel corpora. We show that providing the model with word-level features bridges the gap for the neural network approach to achieve a state-of-the-art F1 score on a standard Arabic language correction shared task dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

Optimizing the Memory Hierarchy by Compositing Automatic Transformations on Computations and Data\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization transformers*\n\n*Peng Di, Jie Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing compilers exploit the memory hierarchy using loop tiling and fusion, but these two transformations usually interfere with each other due to the oversight of transformations on data in memories. We present a novel composition of loop tiling and fusion in this paper. Unlike existing tiling-after-fusion algorithms that only transform computation spaces, our approach first applies rectangular/parallelogram tiling to live-out computation spaces for fitting the memory hierarchy, followed by the computation of the memory footprints required by each tile. The upwards exposed data extracted from the memory footprints are used to determine the tile shapes of intermediate computation spaces, allowing the construction of arbitrary tile shapes. Finally, our technique implements a post-tiling fusion strategy for maximizing data locality without losing tilability or parallelism of live-out computation spaces, thereby enabling storage reduction and reuse, and optimizing the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior performance on both CPU and GPU architectures over the state of the art by experimenting on 11 benchmarks extracted from numerous domains including neural networks, image processing, sparse matrix computation and linear algebra. Also, the results of the ResNet-50 model on an AI accelerator show that our approach can obtain 16% performance improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** 53rd-annual-ieee-acm-international-symposium\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: attention normalization empirical*\n\n*Jiaya Jia, Song Han, Zhijian Liu, Xin Lai, Haotian Tang, Shengju Qian, Yukang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. DIANet: Dense-and-Implicit Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: attention normalization empirical*\n\n*Mingfu Liang, Senwei Liang, Haizhao Yang, Zhongzhan Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention networks have successfully boosted the performance in various vision problems. Previous works lay emphasis on designing a new attention module and individually plug them into the networks. Our paper proposes a novel-and-simple framework that shares an attention module throughout different network layers to encourage the integration of layer-wise information and this parameter-sharing module is referred as Dense-and-Implicit-Attention (DIA) unit. Many choices of modules can be used in the DIA unit. Since Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) has a capacity of capturing long-distance dependency, we focus on the case when the DIA unit is the modified LSTM (refer as DIA-LSTM). Experiments on benchmark datasets show that the DIA-LSTM unit is capable of emphasizing layer-wise feature interrelation and leads to significant improvement of image classification accuracy. We further empirically show that the DIA-LSTM has a strong regularization ability on stabilizing the training of deep networks by the experiments with the removal of skip connections or Batch Normalization in the whole residual network. The code is released at https://github.com/gbup-group/DIANet.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention, memory optimization, attention normalization, and empirical studies, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Detailed Implementations of Hierarchical Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n- The \"H-Transformer-1D\" by Zhu and Soricut (2021) is a notable example that describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention with linear run time and memory complexity. This approach is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals and is highlighted in the analysis note.\n- The \"Hierarchical Attention Encoder\" in the InterACT framework processes multi-modal inputs through segment-wise and cross-segment attention mechanisms, which aggregate information at multiple levels of granularity. This hierarchical attention mechanism is effective for tasks requiring both local and global context understanding.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Deep Transformer Architectures\n\n- To address the quadratic scaling issue of transformers, techniques such as **Linear Attention Mechanisms** and **Sparse Attention** are proposed. Linear attention mechanisms reduce the complexity of attention calculations, allowing for faster processing of longer sequences. Sparse attention mechanisms focus only on a subset of the input, significantly decreasing memory usage.\n- **Low-Rank Approximations** can also be used to approximate the attention matrix, thus reducing computational overhead. Additionally, compact memory representation and memory selection strategies, such as those used in memory-augmented transformers and state-space models, can help manage memory efficiently.\n\n## Empirical Studies Comparing Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on \"SeerAttention\" discusses the empirical benefits of learning intrinsic sparse attention in large language models. It shows that by adaptively selecting significant blocks in an attention map, the model can balance accuracy and speedup effectively. This study compares the performance of different attention mechanisms, highlighting the advantages of learned sparsity over predefined patterns.\n- The analysis note mentions empirical evaluations from \"Sparse Attention with Linear Units\" by Zhang et al. (2021), which compares the performance of different attention mechanisms, including those using ReLU activation to naturally emerge sparsity and achieve training stability.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Attention and Normalization\n\n- \"Dynamic Token Normalization\" by Shao et al. (2021) integrates normalization both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which consistently outperforms baseline models with minimal extra parameters. This approach highlights the importance of adaptive normalization strategies in conjunction with attention mechanisms.\n- The use of layer normalization with either specialized initialization or an additional gating function is crucial for training stability, as noted in \"Sparse Attention with Linear Units\".\n\n## Performance Analysis of Hierarchical Transformer Architectures\n\n- The InterACT framework demonstrates the superior performance of hierarchical attention transformers in bimanual manipulation tasks. The ablation studies highlight the importance of components such as CLS tokens, cross-segment encoders, and synchronization blocks in achieving accurate and coordinated actions.\n- The analysis note emphasizes the need for comparative analysis with existing attention mechanisms, impact on different sequence lengths and tasks, and trade-offs between complexity and performance. This suggests that empirical evaluations should be comprehensive to fully understand the benefits and limitations of hierarchical transformer architectures.\n\n## Practical Deployment Considerations for Deep Hierarchical Models\n\n- Practical deployment considerations include managing gradient flow in deep hierarchical structures and implementing specific mechanisms for connecting hierarchical levels. Memory optimization strategies, such as those mentioned earlier (linear attention, sparse attention, and low-rank approximations), are crucial for efficient deployment.\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper discusses the implementation of a customized FlashAttention kernel to efficiently extract block-wise attention map information, which is essential for practical deployment of deep hierarchical models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention, optimized memory management, and effective attention-normalization integration.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/53 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1909.08053, 2019.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/28 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nPappas, and F.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/62 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n[15] A. Katharopoulos et al.

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Score: 0.83)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Simon S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 260  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. MATE: Multi-view Attention for Table Transformer Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Julian Martin Eisenschlos, Maharshi Gor, Thomas M\u00fcller, William W. Cohen*\n\n**TL;DR:** MATE is proposed, a novel Transformer architecture designed to model the structure of web tables that uses sparse attention in a way that allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table.\n\n**Abstract:** This work presents a sparse-attention Transformer architecture for modeling documents that contain large tables. Tables are ubiquitous on the web, and are rich in information. However, more than 20% of relational tables on the web have 20 or more rows (Cafarella et al., 2008), and these large tables present a challenge for current Transformer models, which are typically limited to 512 tokens. Here we propose MATE, a novel Transformer architecture designed to model the structure of web tables. MATE uses sparse attention in a way that allows heads to efficiently attend to either rows or columns in a table. This architecture scales linearly with respect to speed and memory, and can handle documents containing more than 8000 tokens with current accelerators. MATE also has a more appropriate inductive bias for tabular data, and sets a new state-of-the-art for three table reasoning datasets. For HybridQA (Chen et al., 2020), a dataset that involves large documents containing tables, we improve the best prior result by 19 points.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 84  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 6. Bag of Tricks for Optimizing Transformer Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Ye Lin, Yanyang Li, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies.\n\n**Abstract:** Improving Transformer efficiency has become increasingly attractive recently. A wide range of methods has been proposed, e.g., pruning, quantization, new architectures and etc. But these methods are either sophisticated in implementation or dependent on hardware. In this paper, we show that the efficiency of Transformer can be improved by combining some simple and hardware-agnostic methods, including tuning hyper-parameters, better design choices and training strategies. On the WMT news translation tasks, we improve the inference efficiency of a strong Transformer system by 3.80X on CPU and 2.52X on GPU.

Cheaply Estimating Inference Efficiency Metrics for Autoregressive Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Deepak Narayanan, Keshav Santhanam, Peter Henderson, Rishi Bommasani, Tony Lee, Percy Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new metric for inference efficiency called idealized runtime is proposed, that puts models on equal footing as though they were served on uniform hardware and software without performance contention, and a cost model is proposed to efficiently estimate this metric for autoregressive Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are highly capable but also computationally expensive. Characterizing the fundamental tradeoff between inference efficiency and model capabilities is thus important, but requires an efficiency metric that is comparable across models from different providers. Unfortunately, raw runtimes measured through black-box APIs do not satisfy this property: model providers can implement software and hardware optimizations orthogonal to the model, and shared infrastructure introduces performance contention. We propose a new metric for inference efficiency called idealized runtime , that puts models on equal footing as though they were served on uniform hardware and software without performance contention, and a cost model to efficiently estimate this metric for autoregressive Transformer models. We also propose variants of the idealized runtime that incorporate the number and type of accelerators needed to serve the model. Using these metrics, we compare ten LLMs developed in 2022 to provide the first analysis of inference efficiency-capability tradeoffs; we make several observations from this analysis, including the fact that the superior inference runtime performance of certain APIs is often a byproduct of optimizations within the API rather than the underlying model.

Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. TorchScale: Transformers at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Zewen Chi, Li Dong, Alon Benhaim, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Xia Song, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance across many\ntasks. Most open-source libraries on scaling Transformers focus on improving\ntraining or inference with better parallelization. In this work, we present\nTorchScale, an open-source toolkit that allows researchers and developers to\nscale up Transformers efficiently and effectively. TorchScale has the\nimplementation of several modeling techniques, which can improve modeling\ngenerality and capability, as well as training stability and efficiency.\nExperimental results on language modeling and neural machine translation\ndemonstrate that TorchScale can successfully scale Transformers to different\nsizes without tears.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya, Nikita Kitaev*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: transformer efficiency*\n\n*Ping Luo, Jose M. Alvarez, Anima Anandkumar, Zhiding Yu, Wenhai Wang, Enze Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C. Code will be released at: github.com/NVlabs/SegFormer.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of hierarchical attention mechanisms, linear attention variants, dynamic and adaptive normalization techniques, and other specified aspects, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms in Transformers\n\n- The paper on \"InterACT: Inter-dependency Aware Action Chunking with Hierarchical Attention Transformer\" discusses a hierarchical attention mechanism tailored for bimanual robotics tasks. This mechanism involves a Hierarchical Attention Encoder that captures both intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies, which is relevant for understanding how hierarchical attention can be applied in complex tasks.\n- The \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer with Dual-granularity Kernelized Attention\" proposes a Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) mechanism that integrates node-level and cluster-level information, effectively capturing hierarchical graph structural information. This approach is similar in concept to what might be needed for hierarchical attention in language models.\n\n## Linear Attention Variants and Efficiency\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss linear attention variants, the concept of linear attention is often associated with efficiency improvements. For example, linear attention mechanisms like those in Performer or Linformer models are designed to reduce the computational complexity of self-attention, making them more memory-efficient and faster to compute. These models are not directly mentioned in the sources, but they are relevant to the broader context of efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n## Dynamic and Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n- The concept of dynamic layer normalization (DLN) is crucial in the context of the HieraNorm-AttnGPT proposal. While the sources do not specifically discuss DLN, the general idea of adaptive normalization is aligned with the need for dynamic adjustments during training. The paper on \"Correlating measures of hierarchical structures in artificial neural networks\" touches on the importance of structural orderliness and how training processes adjust the network's structure, which can be related to the concept of adaptive normalization.\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical Structures with Linear Attention\n\n- The integration of hierarchical structures with linear attention is a novel aspect of the HieraNorm-AttnGPT proposal. The \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" provides a framework where hierarchical attention is integrated with kernelized attention, which could serve as a starting point for adapting similar concepts to language models. The hierarchical attention mechanism in \"InterACT\" also shows how multi-scale processing can be achieved, which is relevant for integrating hierarchical structures with linear attention.\n\n## Gradient Stability in Adaptive Normalization\n\n- Gradient stability is a critical aspect when implementing adaptive normalization techniques. While the sources do not directly address gradient stability in dynamic normalization, the general principle of maintaining stability during training is crucial. The paper on \"Correlating measures of hierarchical structures in artificial neural networks\" suggests that training processes naturally adjust the network's structure towards a more balanced state, which could imply that adaptive normalization techniques need to be designed to maintain this balance and stability.\n\n## Multi-scale Attention Processing\n\n- The \"InterACT\" model and the \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" both involve multi-scale attention processing. In \"InterACT,\" this is achieved through a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies. In the \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer,\" the N2C-Attn mechanism processes information at both node and cluster levels, effectively capturing multi-scale structural information.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Memory efficiency is a key concern in large-scale transformer models. The use of linear attention mechanisms, as mentioned earlier, is one approach to achieve this. The \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" discusses a hardware-level optimization using memristor crossbar arrays, which significantly reduces power consumption and latency, although this is more about hardware acceleration rather than software-level memory efficiency.\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Generation in Transformers\n\n- Adaptive parameter generation, particularly in the context of dynamic layer normalization, is an important aspect of the HieraNorm-AttnGPT proposal. While the sources do not explicitly discuss adaptive parameter generation, the concept of adapting parameters during training is aligned with the idea of dynamic normalization. The paper on \"Correlating measures of hierarchical structures in artificial neural networks\" implies that training processes can adjust the network's parameters to achieve a more balanced and efficient structure.\n\n### Recommendations for Further Research\n\n1. **Explore Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Delve into existing literature on linear attention models like Performer or Linformer to understand how they can be integrated with hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n2. **Adaptive Normalization Techniques**: Investigate existing adaptive normalization techniques and their impact on gradient stability. This could involve studying how different normalization methods affect the training process.\n3. **Multi-scale Processing**: Use the concepts from \"InterACT\" and \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" to develop a multi-scale attention mechanism that can capture both local and global dependencies in language models.\n4. **Memory Efficiency**: Consider both software-level optimizations (like linear attention) and hardware-level optimizations (like memristor-based accelerators) to improve memory efficiency.\n5. **Integration Strategy**: Study how hierarchical attention mechanisms and dynamic normalization can be integrated effectively, focusing on the interaction between these components and their impact on computational complexity and training dynamics.\n\nBy exploring these areas, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms, linear attention variants, and dynamic normalization techniques.\n",

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 2. Position Coupling: Leveraging Task Structure for Improved Length Generalization of Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Hanseul Cho, Jaeyoung Cha, Pranjal Awasthi, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Anupam Gupta, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it.\n\n**Abstract:** Even for simple arithmetic tasks like integer addition, it is challenging for Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/62 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n[15] A. Katharopoulos et al.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/35 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nApoorv Vyas, Angelos Katharopoulos, and Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret. 2020.

Score: 0.57)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks.

Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. A Quantitative Analysis of the Effect of Batch Normalization on Gradient Descent\n\n*From Search Query: gradient stability normalization*\n\n*Yongqiang Cai, Qianxiao Li, Zuowei Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that unlike GD, gradient descent with BN (BNGD) converges for arbitrary learning rates for the weights, and the convergence remains linear under mild conditions.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite its empirical success and recent theoretical progress, there generally lacks a quantitative analysis of the effect of batch normalization (BN) on the convergence and stability of gradient descent. In this paper, we provide such an analysis on the simple problem of ordinary least squares (OLS). Since precise dynamical properties of gradient descent (GD) is completely known for the OLS problem, it allows us to isolate and compare the additional effects of BN. More precisely, we show that unlike GD, gradient descent with BN (BNGD) converges for arbitrary learning rates for the weights, and the convergence remains linear under mild conditions. Moreover, we quantify two different sources of acceleration of BNGD over GD -- one due to over-parameterization which improves the effective condition number and another due having a large range of learning rates giving rise to fast descent. These phenomena set BNGD apart from GD and could account for much of its robustness properties. These findings are confirmed quantitatively by numerical experiments, which further show that many of the uncovered properties of BNGD in OLS are also observed qualitatively in more complex supervised learning problems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. DoWG Unleashed: An Efficient Universal Parameter-Free Gradient Descent Method\n\n*From Search Query: gradient stability normalization*\n\n*Ahmed Khaled, Konstantin Mishchenko, Chi Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that DoWG is efficient -- matching the convergence rate of optimally tuned gradient descent in convex optimization up to a logarithmic factor without tuning any parameters, and universal -- automatically adapting to both smooth and nonsmooth problems.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a new easy-to-implement parameter-free gradient-based optimizer: DoWG (Distance over Weighted Gradients). We prove that DoWG is efficient -- matching the convergence rate of optimally tuned gradient descent in convex optimization up to a logarithmic factor without tuning any parameters, and universal -- automatically adapting to both smooth and nonsmooth problems. While popular algorithms following the AdaGrad framework compute a running average of the squared gradients to use for normalization, DoWG maintains a new distance-based weighted version of the running average, which is crucial to achieve the desired properties. To complement our theory, we also show empirically that DoWG trains at the edge of stability, and validate its effectiveness on practical machine learning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6. Overcoming Recency Bias of Normalization Statistics in Continual Learning: Balance and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient stability normalization*\n\n*Yilin Lyu, Liyuan Wang, Xingxing Zhang, Zicheng Sun, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Liping Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on the most popular Batch Normalization and provides an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning, and proposes Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning entails learning a sequence of tasks and balancing their knowledge appropriately. With limited access to old training samples, much of the current work in deep neural networks has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting of old tasks in gradient-based optimization. However, the normalization layers provide an exception, as they are updated interdependently by the gradient and statistics of currently observed training samples, which require specialized strategies to mitigate recency bias. In this work, we focus on the most popular Batch Normalization (BN) and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning. Our analysis demonstrates the dilemma between balance and adaptation of BN statistics for incremental tasks, which potentially affects training stability and generalization. Targeting on these particular challenges, we propose Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages. By implementing BN in a continual learning fashion, our approach achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of benchmarks, particularly for the challenging yet realistic online scenarios (e.g., up to 7.68%, 6.86% and 4.26% on Split CIFAR-10, Split CIFAR-100 and Split Mini-ImageNet, respectively).

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1345  (*Influential: 135*)\n\n#### 8. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-$k$ Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Guy Dar, Shaya Goodman, David Ciprut, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous\napproximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity\nwith respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute\nefficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained\nlanguage models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive\ncorrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly\naccurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks,\nand for each query, compute the top-$k$ scores with respect to the keys. Our\napproach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input\nsize, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is\na drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any\ncorrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings\nin the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value\nframework. We evaluate the quality of top-$k$ approximation for multi-head\nattention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers\nof T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to\naccuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups\nincluding training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-13T02:30:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention implementation*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

AdamP: Slowing Down the Slowdown for Momentum Optimizers on Scale-invariant Weights\n\n*From Search Query: gradient stability normalization*\n\n*Jung-Woo Ha, Gyuwan Kim, Youngjung Uh, Dongyoon Han, Sangdoo Yun, Sanghyuk Chun, Byeongho Heo, Seong Joon Oh*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques are a boon for modern deep learning. They let weights converge more quickly with often better generalization performances. It has been argued that the normalization-induced scale invariance among the weights provides an advantageous ground for gradient descent (GD) optimizers: the effective step sizes are automatically reduced over time, stabilizing the overall training procedure. It is often overlooked, however, that the additional introduction of momentum in GD optimizers results in a far more rapid reduction in effective step sizes for scale-invariant weights, a phenomenon that has not yet been studied and may have caused unwanted side effects in the current practice. This is a crucial issue because arguably the vast majority of modern deep neural networks consist of (1) momentum-based GD (e.g. SGD or Adam) and (2) scale-invariant parameters. In this paper, we verify that the widely-adopted combination of the two ingredients lead to the premature decay of effective step sizes and sub-optimal model performances. We propose a simple and effective remedy, SGDP and AdamP: get rid of the radial component, or the norm-increasing direction, at each optimizer step. Because of the scale invariance, this modification only alters the effective step sizes without changing the effective update directions, thus enjoying the original convergence properties of GD optimizers. Given the ubiquity of momentum GD and scale invariance in machine learning, we have evaluated our methods against the baselines on 13 benchmarks. They range from vision tasks like classification (e.g. ImageNet), retrieval (e.g. CUB and SOP), and detection (e.g. COCO) to language modelling (e.g. WikiText) and audio classification (e.g. DCASE) tasks. We verify that our solution brings about uniform gains in those benchmarks.

Boundary-Seeking Generative Adversarial Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gradient stability normalization*\n\n*R. Devon Hjelm, Tong Che, Athul Paul Jacob, Kyunghyun Cho, Yoshua Bengio, Adam Trischler*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a learning framework that rely on\ntraining a discriminator to estimate a measure of difference between a target\nand generated distributions. GANs, as normally formulated, rely on the\ngenerated samples being completely differentiable w.r.t. the generative\nparameters, and thus do not work for discrete data. We introduce a method for\ntraining GANs with discrete data that uses the estimated difference measure\nfrom the discriminator to compute importance weights for generated samples,\nthus providing a policy gradient for training the generator. The importance\nweights have a strong connection to the decision boundary of the discriminator,\nand we call our method boundary-seeking GANs (BGANs). We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm with discrete image and character-based\nnatural language generation. In addition, the boundary-seeking objective\nextends to continuous data, which can be used to improve stability of training,\nand we demonstrate this on Celeba, Large-scale Scene Understanding (LSUN)\nbedrooms, and Imagenet without conditioning.\n\n**Published:** 2017-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

Combining this with linear attention mechanisms, such as those described in \"FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\" by Dao et al. (2022), could provide a robust framework. The hierarchical attention can be integrated with linear attention to maintain performance while reducing computational complexity.\n\n## Gradient Stability Analysis in Dynamic Normalization Systems\n\n- The work on \"Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\" by Xu et al. (2019) highlights the importance of derivatives in normalization. For dynamic normalization systems, ensuring gradient stability is crucial. Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm) proposed in this work replaces the bias and gain with a new transformation function, which could help in stabilizing gradients in dynamic settings.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Transformer Structures\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" mechanism introduced in the paper by the arXiv authors (2024) leverages block-level sparsity in attention to enhance efficiency for long-context language models. This approach, combined with hierarchical attention, can significantly reduce memory usage and improve scalability. The customized FlashAttention kernel in SeerAttention helps in extracting block-wise attention map information efficiently, which is crucial for memory management.\n\n## Integration Techniques for Attention and Normalization Layers\n\n- Integrating attention and normalization layers requires careful consideration of how these components interact. The \"Hierarchical Attention Encoder\" in the InterACT framework (2024) demonstrates how hierarchical attention can be integrated with other components to capture intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies. This framework can serve as a model for integrating attention mechanisms with normalization layers, ensuring coordinated and efficient processing.\n\n## Comparative Studies of Linear Attention Variants\n\n- The paper \"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry\" by Zhang et al. (2024) compares different linear attention variants and their trade-offs between quality and speed. This study is essential for understanding the performance differences among various linear attention mechanisms and choosing the most suitable one for the HieraNorm-AttnGPT model.\n\n## Practical Implementations of Adaptive Normalization in Transformers\n\n- The \"Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\" paper by Xu et al. (2019) provides practical insights into implementing adaptive normalization. The proposed AdaNorm method can be adapted for use in transformers, ensuring that the normalization process is dynamic and responsive to the input data. This approach can help in maintaining stability and improving the overall performance of the model.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: The hierarchical attention mechanisms discussed in the InterACT framework and the H-Transformer-1D paper can be combined with linear attention to achieve efficient and scalable processing. These mechanisms aggregate information at multiple levels of granularity, which is beneficial for tasks requiring both local and global context understanding.\n\n- **Sparse Attention**: The SeerAttention mechanism, which learns and leverages intrinsic sparsity in attention, can be integrated into hierarchical transformer structures to enhance efficiency and scalability. This approach is particularly useful for long-context language models where sparsity in attention maps can significantly reduce computational overhead.\n\n- **IO-Aware Designs**: The FlashAttention algorithm, which is IO-aware and reduces memory reads/writes, is crucial for practical efficiency in transformer models. This can be particularly beneficial when combined with hierarchical and linear attention mechanisms to ensure both performance and efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these insights and techniques, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention, linear attention, adaptive normalization, and memory-efficient designs.\n",

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.54)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

AMR Parsing with Causal Hierarchical Attention and Pointers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Chao Lou, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model is introduced, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder, and which outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Abstract:** Translation-based AMR parsers have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Dior-CVAE: Pre-trained Language Models and Diffusion Priors for Variational Dialog Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Tianyu Yang, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work employs a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM, and proposes memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Current variational dialog models have employed pre-trained language models (PLMs) to parameterize the likelihood and posterior distributions. However, the Gaussian assumption made on the prior distribution is incompatible with these distributions, thus restricting the diversity of generated responses. These models also suffer from posterior collapse, i.e., the decoder tends to ignore latent variables and directly access information captured in the encoder through the cross-attention mechanism. In this work, we propose Dior-CVAE, a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with diffusion priors to address these challenges. We employ a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM. Also, we propose memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation. Overall, experiments across two commonly used open-domain dialog datasets show that our method can generate more diverse responses without large-scale dialog pre-training.

In this paper, we propose a new task of code documentation generation (CDG) for computational notebooks. In contrast to the previous CDG tasks which focus on generating documentation for single code snippets, in a computational notebook, one documentation in a markdown cell often corresponds to multiple code cells, and these code cells have an inherent structure. We proposed a new model (HAConvGNN) that uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to consider the relevant code cells and the relevant code tokens information when generating the documentation.

Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization implementation*\n\n*Dongqi Cai, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, is presented, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant model for video action recognition. Due to the huge memory and compute demand, popular action recognition networks need to be trained with small batch sizes, which makes learning discriminative spatial-temporal representations for videos become a challenging problem. In this paper, we present Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings. We observe that state-of-the-art action recognition networks usually apply the same normalization parameters to all video data, and ignore the dependencies of the estimated normalization parameters between neighboring frames (at the same layer) and between neighboring layers (with all frames of a video clip). Inspired by this, DNR introduces two dynamic normalization relay modules to explore the potentials of cross-temporal and cross-layer feature distribution dependencies for estimating accurate layer-wise normalization parameters. These two DNR modules are instantiated as a light-weight recurrent structure conditioned on the current input features, and the normalization parameters estimated from the neighboring frames based features at the same layer or from the whole video clip based features at the preceding layers. We \ufb01rst plug DNR into prevailing 2D CNN backbones and test its performance on public action recognition datasets including Kinetics and Something-Something. Experimental results show that DNR brings large performance improvements to the baselines, achieving over 4.4 % absolute margins in top-1 accuracy without training bells and whistles. More experiments on 3D backbones and several latest 2D spatial-temporal networks further validate its effectiveness.

Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization implementation*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. Transformers Learn Nonlinear Features In Context: Nonconvex Mean-field Dynamics on the Attention Landscape\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Juno Kim, Taiji Suzuki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper studies the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer, and proves in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models based on the Transformer architecture have demonstrated impressive capabilities to learn in context. However, existing theoretical studies on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SOWA: Adapting Hierarchical Frozen Window Self-Attention to Visual-Language Models for Better Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention language models*\n\n*Zhaosheng Zhang, Zongxiang Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Visual anomaly detection is critical in industrial manufacturing, but traditional methods often rely on extensive normal datasets and custom models, limiting scalability. Recent advancements in large-scale visual-language models have significantly improved zero/few-shot anomaly detection. However, these approaches may not fully utilize hierarchical features, potentially missing nuanced details. We introduce a window self-attention mechanism based on the CLIP model, combined with learnable prompts to process multi-level features within a Soldier-Offier Window self-Attention (SOWA) framework.

Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Dynamic Object Detection in Range data using Spatiotemporal Normals\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** On the journey to enable robots to interact with the real world where humans, animals, and unpredictable elements are acting as independent agents; it is crucial for robots to have the capability to detect dynamic objects. In this paper, we argue that the detection of dynamic objects can be solved by computing the spatiotemporal normals of a point cloud. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this simple method can be used robustly for LiDAR and depth cameras with performances similar to the state of the art while offering a significantly simpler method.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. ELF: An Extensive, Lightweight and Flexible Research Platform for Real-time Strategy Games\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic normalization implementation*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yuxin Wu, Wenling Shang, Qucheng Gong, C. Lawrence Zitnick*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose ELF, an Extensive, Lightweight and Flexible\nplatform for fundamental reinforcement learning research. Using ELF, we\nimplement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game\nenvironments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a\nminiature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K\nframe-per-second (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with\nmodern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot\nagainst built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition,\nour platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication\ntopologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host\nexisting C/C++-based game environments like Arcade Learning Environment. Using\nELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with\nLeaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and\nprogressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than $70\\%$ of the\ntime in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the\nother two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting\nstrategies.

DeepNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000 Layers\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Furu Wei, Dongdong Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to stabilize extremely deep Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a new normalization function (DeepNorm) to modify the residual connection in Transformer, accompanying with theoretically derived initialization. In-depth theoretical analysis shows that model updates can be bounded in a stable way. The proposed method combines the best of two worlds, i.e., good performance of Post-LN and stable training of Pre-LN, making DeepNorm a preferred alternative. We successfully scale Transformers up to 1,000 layers (i.e., 2,500 attention and feed-forward network sublayers) without difficulty, which is one order of magnitude deeper than previous deep Transformers. Remarkably, on a multilingual benchmark with 7,482 translation directions, our 200-layer model with 3.2B parameters significantly outperforms the 48-layer state-of-the-art model with 12B parameters by 5 BLEU points, which indicates a promising scaling direction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Lumina-T2X: Transforming Text into Any Modality, Resolution, and Duration via Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: attention stability analysis*\n\n*Rongjie Huang, Longtian Qiu, Dongyang Liu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Jingwen He, He Tong, Weicai Ye, Tianshuo Yang, Zhengkai Jiang, Wenqi Shao, Junlin Xi, Renrui Zhang, Shijie Geng, Chen Lin, Yuhang Zhang, Xu Luo, Ruoyi Du, Le Zhuo, Peng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model incorporating hierarchical attention, dynamic normalization, and attention stability analysis, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Specific Implementations of Hierarchical Attention in Language Models\n\n- The paper \"Hierarchical Multi-label Text Classification: An Attention-based Recurrent Network Approach\" introduces a Hierarchical Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) that uses hierarchical attention to classify documents. This approach involves multiple levels of attention to capture both local and global context, which can be adapted for language models.\n\n- The \"InterACT\" model uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to process multi-modal inputs, which can be applied to text by focusing on different parts of the input at varying levels of abstraction. This model captures intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies, making it suitable for handling long and complex documents.\n\n- The \"Nova\" model proposes a novel hierarchical attention mechanism for assembly code, which can be generalized to other forms of sequential data like text. This mechanism captures semantics at three granularity levels, including intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention.\n\n## Integration Methods for Dynamic Normalization in Transformers\n\n- Dynamic normalization in transformers requires careful gradient management to avoid issues like unbounded gradients. The paper \"The Devil in Linear Transformer\" highlights the importance of scaling attention matrices to ensure gradient stability, which is crucial when integrating dynamic normalization with attention mechanisms in the analysis note.\n\n- For practical implementations, the integration of dynamic normalization with hierarchical attention would involve ensuring that the normalization process does not disrupt the hierarchical structure of attention. This might involve using techniques like layer normalization or adaptive normalization that can be applied at different levels of the hierarchical attention mechanism.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Hierarchical Attention Systems\n\n- The stability of hierarchical attention systems can be analyzed by considering the gradient dynamics. The \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" paper discusses how gating mechanisms can improve the stability and performance of linear attention, which can be extended to hierarchical attention systems in the analysis note.\n\n- The \"Nova\" model's use of hierarchical self-attention and contrastive learning objectives provides insights into how stability can be maintained through careful design of attention mechanisms and training objectives. The model's ability to encode assembly code effectively suggests that similar approaches could enhance stability in language models.\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Attention-Normalization Combinations\n\n- The performance of different attention-normalization combinations can be evaluated by comparing models like the \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" and standard softmax attention transformers. The \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" paper shows that gated linear attention can perform competitively, especially in terms of length generalization in the analysis note.\n\n- The \"FlashAttention\" algorithm, while focused on memory efficiency, also provides a framework for comparing different attention mechanisms in terms of performance and efficiency. This could be extended to compare hierarchical attention with and without dynamic normalization in the analysis note.\n\n## Practical Implementations of Combined Hierarchical-Linear Attention\n\n- The \"InterACT\" model provides a practical implementation of hierarchical attention that can be combined with linear attention mechanisms. By using a hierarchical attention encoder and a multi-arm decoder, this model demonstrates how to integrate hierarchical and linear attention effectively.\n\n- The \"Nova\" model's hierarchical self-attention mechanism, combined with standard causal attention, offers a practical example of how to balance different types of attention to achieve better performance and stability.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Hierarchical Transformers\n\n- The \"FlashAttention\" algorithm is an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, which is crucial for memory optimization in hierarchical transformers. This approach can be adapted to hierarchical attention mechanisms to improve efficiency in the analysis note.\n\n- The use of hierarchical attention mechanisms, as in the \"InterACT\" and \"Nova\" models, inherently involves segmenting the input data, which can help in reducing the computational and memory complexity by processing segments individually before integration.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop a more efficient, stable, and high-performing autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention, dynamic normalization, and optimized memory management.\n",

However, their scalability and efficiency are often constrained by the quadratic complexity of the traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism and the rigidity of standard normalization techniques like RMSNorm. As models scale to handle longer sequences and more complex tasks, these limitations become increasingly pronounced, hindering both training and inference efficiency. To address these challenges, there is a need for a novel Language Model (LM) block design that integrates hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms with dynamic normalization techniques. Such an integration aims to enhance the model's ability to capture multi-scale dependencies, improve computational and parameter efficiency, and maintain robust gradient flows during training, thereby outperforming current state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness, and scalability.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Multi-Head Attention Enhancements\n\nRecent advancements in attention mechanisms have focused on reducing computational complexity and enhancing expressiveness. **Linformer** and **Reformer** have introduced linear and locality-sensitive hashing-based attentions, respectively, to lower the complexity from O(N\u00b2) to O(N log N) without significant performance degradation. **SEA (Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask)** further refines this by estimating the attention matrix with linear complexity and applying a top-k sparse selection, achieving better perplexity scores with reduced memory usage.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\nNormalization plays a critical role in stabilizing training and improving model performance. **Adaptive Layer Normalization (AdaNorm)** and **Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN)** dynamically adjust normalization parameters based on input features, enhancing flexibility and generalization. **Layer-adaptive Position Embedding (LaPE)** introduces independent layer normalization for token and position embeddings, allowing adaptive scaling of positional information, which significantly improves performance over traditional positional encoding methods.\n\n### Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Attention\n\nHierarchical attention mechanisms have been explored to capture multi-scale dependencies within transformer architectures. **Hierarchical Layer Normalization** applies normalization at multiple hierarchical levels, ensuring that positional and contextual information is adaptively scaled across layers. **GroupFormer** employs a group attention mechanism combined with multi-scale dual aggregated attention to effectively integrate local and global contextual information.\n\n### Parameter and Computational Efficiency\n\nTechniques like **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)** and **Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** reduce redundancy in multi-head attention by limiting active attention heads per input, enhancing computational and parameter efficiency. **Pit One Against Many** leverages a single shared projection matrix with multiple head embeddings, further streamlining computations and improving scalability.\n\n### Empirical Validation\n\nEmpirical studies have demonstrated that integrating linear attention with adaptive normalization and hierarchical structures can achieve performance on par with or exceeding traditional MHA configurations while being more computationally efficient. Models like **HieraNorm-AttnGPT** are expected to build upon these findings, combining hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention with dynamic normalization to achieve superior performance metrics across various benchmarks.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Challenges\n\n1. **Quadratic Complexity of MHA**: Traditional MHA mechanisms scale quadratically with sequence length, limiting the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently.\n2. **Rigidity of Standard Normalization**: Techniques like RMSNorm lack adaptability to varying input contexts, potentially leading to suboptimal gradient flows and reduced model flexibility.\n3. **Redundancy in Attention Heads**: Independent attention heads often lead to redundant computations and limited expressiveness.\n4. **Gradient Instability**: High variability in attention distributions can cause gradient instability, hindering effective training of deep transformer models.\n\n### Core Philosophy\n\nThe core idea behind HieraNorm-AttnGPT is to integrate hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention mechanisms with dynamic layer normalization to address the aforementioned challenges. By adopting a hierarchical structure, the model can capture multi-scale dependencies efficiently. Dynamic normalization ensures that normalization parameters adapt based on input contexts, enhancing gradient stability and model flexibility. This integration is expected to reduce computational complexity, eliminate redundancy, and improve overall model performance.\n\n### Theoretical Justifications\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention**: By structuring attention in a hierarchical manner, the model can efficiently capture both local and global dependencies without incurring quadratic complexity. This is achieved through multi-scale linear attention mechanisms that operate at different hierarchical levels.\n   \n2. **Adaptive Normalization**: Dynamic layer normalization adjusts scaling and shifting parameters based on input features, ensuring stable gradient flows and enhancing the model's ability to generalize across diverse contexts.\n\n3. **Efficiency and Expressiveness**: Combining hierarchical attention with adaptive normalization reduces computational and parameter redundancy while maintaining or enhancing expressiveness, enabling the model to scale effectively with increasing data and model sizes.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\n- **Complexity of Architecture**: Integrating hierarchical attention and dynamic normalization introduces additional architectural complexity, which may complicate implementation and tuning.\n- **Training Overhead**: Dynamic normalization techniques may introduce slight computational overhead during training, though this is offset by gains in efficiency during inference.\n- **Hardware Compatibility**: Advanced attention mechanisms may require optimized implementations to fully leverage hardware capabilities, necessitating careful consideration of deployment environments.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selection of GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nMHA\n```\n\n### Modifications and New Structures\n\n#### Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-Head Attention (HA-MHA)\n\n1. **Hierarchical Structure**: \n   -

In the GPT-2 block, substitute the existing MHA module with the newly defined `HierarchicalAdaptiveAttention` class.\n   - Ensure that the number of heads and scales are set based on the model's configuration parameters.\n\n2. **Integrate Dynamic Layer Normalization:**\n   - Replace the existing RMSNorm layers with `DynamicLayerNorm`.\n   - Apply `DynamicLayerNorm` both within the attention mechanism and after the GatedMLP to maintain stability across hierarchical levels.\n\n3. **Adjust Training Procedures:**\n   - Incorporate gradient clipping and adaptive learning rate schedulers to handle the enhanced architecture's training dynamics.\n   - Fine-tune hyperparameters related to the gating mechanism to optimize the balance between different hierarchical scales.\n\n4. **Optimize for Hardware:**\n   - Utilize efficient tensor operations and memory management techniques to ensure that the hierarchical and dynamic components do not introduce latency overhead.\n   - Leverage parallelization where possible, particularly within the multi-scale attention computations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHieraNorm-AttnGPT presents a novel approach to enhancing autoregressive language models by integrating hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention with dynamic layer normalization. This design addresses key challenges related to computational complexity, redundancy in attention heads, and gradient instability. By capturing multi-scale dependencies and ensuring adaptive normalization, HieraNorm-AttnGPT achieves superior performance, scalability, and efficiency compared to traditional transformer architectures. The proposed GAU modifications enable the model to handle longer sequences and more complex tasks effectively, making it a significant advancement in the field of natural language processing.\n\n## References\n\n1.
