Summary of Search Results and Their Implications**\n\nThe proposal aims to enhance the TTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations. The goal is to improve the model's ability to dynamically adapt during test-time training (TTT), effectively capturing both local and global dependencies with improved computational efficiency.\n\n**Implications from Search Results:**\n\n- **Novelty:**\n  - The integration of gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutions into TTTLinear GAUs for autoregressive language models is a novel approach. Existing literature combines gating mechanisms with graph neural networks (GNNs) in other contexts but not specifically within TTTLinear GAUs or for test-time training adaptations.\n  - References such as \"Gated Linear Units (GLU)\" by Dauphin et al. (2017) and \"Graph Convolutions over Constituent Trees for Syntax-Aware Semantic Role Labeling\" by Marcheggiani & Titov (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of gating and graph convolutions individually but do not explore their combined integration into GAUs.\n\n- **Relevance:**\n  - Recent works emphasize enhancing sequence models to capture complex dependencies efficiently. The proposal aligns with current research trends aiming to improve expressiveness and robustness in language models.\n  - Studies on state space models, such as \"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\" (Gu & Dao, 2023), highlight the benefits of data-dependent gating mechanisms for selective information propagation.\n\n- **Feasibility:**\n  - Implementing graph convolutions in autoregressive models presents computational challenges due to potential overhead, especially with long sequences. However, efficient implementation strategies, such as approximate graph convolutions, localized graph operations, or attention-based methods (e.g., Graph Attention Networks), can mitigate these concerns.\n  - Modular design and careful architectural planning can ensure compatibility with TTTLinear's structure, facilitating implementation and optimization.\n\n---\n\n**2. Highlights and Concerns**\n\n**Highlights:**\n\n- **Enhanced Expressiveness:**\n  - The integration of gating mechanisms allows for dynamic control over information flow, improving the model's adaptability during test-time training.\n  - Graph-inspired convolutions enable the modeling of complex global dependencies beyond sequential token relations, enhancing contextual understanding.\n\n- **Theoretical Soundness:**\n  - The proposal is grounded in established concepts from gating mechanisms and graph neural networks, applying them innovatively within the TTTLinear GAU framework.\n  - Mathematical formulations and pseudo-code provided in the proposal demonstrate a clear theoretical foundation and practical implementation plan.\n\n- **Alignment with Research Trends:**\n  - The approach aligns with the ongoing efforts to develop models capable of efficient long-range dependency modeling while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:**\n  - Graph convolutions can introduce significant computational overhead, potentially impacting training and inference times.\n  - The scalability of the model may be affected if efficient computational strategies are not employed.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity:**\n  - Integrating new mechanisms into the existing TTTLinear GAU requires careful architectural design to prevent conflicts and ensure stability.\n  - The proposal may increase the model's complexity, affecting ease of training and potential for errors.\n\n- **Scalability:**\n  - The ability of the enhanced model to scale with larger datasets and longer sequences is uncertain without empirical validation.\n  - Ensuring that computational efficiency is maintained at scale is crucial.\n\n---\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Design**\n\n**Clarity:**\n\nThe proposal is clearly articulated, with well-defined objectives and a detailed plan. It includes mathematical formulations and pseudo-code, aiding in understanding the proposed modifications.\n\n**Innovation:**\n\nThe modification introduces new improvements by uniquely combining gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutions within the TTTLinear GAU for test-time training. This approach is innovative and has not been previously explored in this specific context.\n\n**Feasibility:**\n\nWhile theoretically sound, practical implementation may present challenges due to computational overhead and architectural complexity. Efficient strategies and careful design are required to ensure successful integration.\n\n**Scalability:**\n\nThe design has potential for scalability if computational efficiency can be maintained. Efficient implementation of graph convolutions and gating mechanisms is essential to ensure the model scales with larger datasets and sequences.\n\n**Accuracy and Robustness:**\n\nThe proposed changes are likely to enhance the model's ability to capture complex dependencies, potentially improving accuracy on downstream tasks. Gating mechanisms may improve robustness by allowing dynamic adaptations to varying inputs during test-time training.\n\n**Efficiency:**\n\nThere is a risk of increased computational complexity due to graph convolutions. However, using efficient approximations or localized operations can mitigate this, potentially resulting in a model that remains computationally efficient.\n\n---\n\n**4. Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n- **Optimize Computational Efficiency:**\n  - **Approximate Graph Convolutions:** Utilize attention-based approximations or localized graph operations to reduce computational overhead while capturing essential dependencies.\n  - **Sparse Representations:** Employ sparse adjacency matrices to minimize computations in graph convolutions.\n\n- **Detailed Implementation Plan:**\n  - Provide more specifics on how the adjacency matrices for graph convolutions will be constructed and optimized.\n  - Outline the steps for integrating gating mechanisms without introducing significant computational costs.\n\n- **Empirical Validation:**\n  - Plan experiments to assess the impact of the proposed modifications on model performance and computational efficiency.\n  - Compare the enhanced model with existing baselines on standard benchmarks to quantify improvements.\n\n- **Scalability Testing:**\n  - Evaluate the model on longer sequences and larger datasets to test scalability.\n  - Monitor computational resource usage to ensure efficiency at scale.\n\n- **Implementation of Efficient Techniques:**\n  - Leverage hardware acceleration and parallel computing where possible.\n  - Consider using optimized libraries or frameworks for graph computations.\n\n---\n\n**5.

Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference. To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py). We open-sourced the code of our implementation and most of the evaluation as a colab to help others reproduce the results: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/memory_efficient_attention. ### 5.1 Inference\n\nIn Table 2 we compare the memory requirements and the compute time of the memory-efficient attention implementation and the Flax implementation of attention.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

We believe our innovative attention mechanism can benefit both NLP and machine learning communities in constructing long-range foundation models. Specifically, we highlight the potential impacts of SPARSEK as follows:\n\n- Efficient Long-Range Modeling. First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention neural architecture*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention neural architecture*\n\n*A. Ardakani, C. Condo, W. Gross*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparsely-connected neural networks are proposed, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets while proposing an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely- connected networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

MAC moves away from monolithic black-box neural architectures towards a design that encourages both transparency and versatility. The model approaches problems by decomposing them into a series of attention-based reasoning steps, each performed by a novel recurrent Memory, Attention, and Composition (MAC) cell that maintains a separation between control and memory. By stringing the cells together and imposing structural constraints that regulate their interaction, MAC effectively learns to perform iterative reasoning processes that are directly inferred from the data in an end-to-end approach. We demonstrate the model's strength, robustness and interpretability on the challenging CLEVR dataset for visual reasoning, achieving a new state-of-the-art 98.9% accuracy, halving the error rate of the previous best model. More importantly, we show that the model is computationally-efficient and data-efficient, in particular requiring 5x less data than existing models to achieve strong results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 551  (*Influential: 85*)\n\n#### 5.

Semi-parametric architectures are typically more compact than parametric models, but their computational complexity is often quadratic. In contrast, SPIN attains linear complexity via a cross-attention mechanism between datapoints inspired by inducing point methods. Querying large training sets can be particularly useful in meta-learning, as it unlocks additional training signal, but often exceeds the scaling limits of existing models. We use SPIN as the basis of the Inducing Point Neural Process, a probabilistic model which supports large contexts in meta-learning and achieves high accuracy where existing models fail. In our experiments, SPIN reduces memory requirements, improves accuracy across a range of meta-learning tasks, and improves state-of-the-art performance on an important practical problem, genotype imputation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. CrossViT: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale Vision Transformer for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention neural architecture*\n\n*Rameswar Panda, Quanfu Fan, Chun-Fu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently developed vision transformer (ViT) has achieved promising results on image classification compared to convolutional neural networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we study how to learn multi-scale feature representations in transformer models for image classification. To this end, we propose a dual-branch transformer to combine image patches (i.e., tokens in a transformer) of different sizes to produce stronger image features. Our approach processes small-patch and large-patch tokens with two separate branches of different computational complexity and these tokens are then fused purely by attention multiple times to complement each other. Furthermore, to reduce computation, we develop a simple yet effective token fusion module based on cross attention, which uses a single token for each branch as a query to exchange information with other branches. Our proposed cross-attention only requires linear time for both computational and memory complexity instead of quadratic time otherwise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs better than or on par with several concurrent works on vision transformer, in addition to efficient CNN models. For example, on the ImageNet1K dataset, with some architectural changes, our approach outperforms the recent DeiT by a large margin of 2\\% with a small to moderate increase in FLOPs and model parameters.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mutual Information Scaling and Expressive Power of Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention neural architecture*\n\n*Huitao Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence models assign probabilities to variable-length sequences such as natural language texts. The ability of sequence models to capture temporal dependence can be characterized by the temporal scaling of correlation and mutual information. In this paper, we study the mutual information of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) including long short-term memories and self-attention networks such as Transformers. Through a combination of theoretical study of linear RNNs and empirical study of nonlinear RNNs, we find their mutual information decays exponentially in temporal distance. On the other hand, Transformers can capture long-range mutual information more efficiently, making them preferable in modeling sequences with slow power-law mutual information, such as natural languages and stock prices. We discuss the connection of these results with statistical mechanics. We also point out the non-uniformity problem in many natural language datasets. We hope this work provides a new perspective in understanding the expressive power of sequence models and shed new light on improving the architecture of them.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on memory-efficient attention mechanisms, attention optimization strategies, and hardware efficiency considerations, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Sparse Attention and Adaptive KV-Cache Compression\n- The CASAK-V method introduces dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which significantly reduces memory usage by up to 40% and maintains performance even for long contexts. This approach adapts sparse attention patterns and compresses the KV cache, leading to near-linear scaling in memory usage and sub-linear scaling in inference time.\n\n### Multi-Query Attention\n- Multi-query attention, where the keys and values are shared across different attention heads, can greatly reduce memory bandwidth requirements. This technique is highlighted in works such as \"Fast Transformer Decoding\" and can be particularly effective for incremental decoding.\n\n## Attention Optimization Strategies\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n- Sparse attention mechanisms, such as those used in Sparse Transformers, Reformer, BigBird, and Routing Transformers, limit the number of tokens each query attends to, reducing computational complexity. Dynamic sparse attention methods adaptively select tokens based on criteria like locality or global importance.\n\n### Efficient Attention Implementations\n- Approaches like FlashAttention and its variants optimize the implementation of attention computation, reducing memory usage and improving speed. However, these may require retraining or fine-tuning, which can be computationally expensive.\n\n### Quaternion Attention Model\n- Quaternion-inspired models, such as the Quaternion attention Model and Quaternion Transformer, use quaternion algebra to reduce parameter size by up to 75% without significant performance loss. This can be particularly beneficial for memory-efficient designs.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency Considerations\n\n### Hardware-Aware Designs\n- Optimizing models for specific hardware is crucial. For instance, using streaming multiprocessors (SMs) in GPUs, which are designed for SIMT (single-instruction multiple threads), can make computations more flexible and efficient for generic scientific workloads, including deep learning.\n\n### Cache Utilization and Memory Access Patterns\n- Designs that optimize cache utilization and memory access patterns are essential for performance. Techniques like decomposable attention, which applies self-attention to feedforward networks, are easier to parallelize and can be accelerated on GPUs.\n\n### Parallelizing Attention\n- Self-attention mechanisms, when applied to feedforward networks, can be easily parallelized, which is a significant advantage over recurrent networks. This is demonstrated in the Transformer architecture and its variants.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Hierarchical State Management\n- Efficient memory handling for long sequences often involves hierarchical state management. Techniques like memory compression and selective token and channel mixing mechanisms can help in managing state efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n### Position Encoding Optimization\n- Optimizing position encoding, such as using RoPE (Rotary Position Embedding), can enhance the model's extrapolation performance. Fine-tuning models with optimized position encodings can significantly improve their capabilities[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014dynamic sparse attention, multi-query attention, efficient attention implementations, quaternion-inspired models, and hardware-aware designs\u2014the researchers can develop more memory-efficient and hardware-optimized autoregressive language models. These approaches can help balance memory efficiency with model expressiveness and improve overall performance.\n",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form.

This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1. Central to the design of gated linear attention is the parameterization of $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ which requires a balance between parameter-efficiency, state size, and training efficiency.

Mao (2022) propose a more efficient outer-product-based low-rank parameterization $\\left(\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{t}\\right)$, which requires $d \\cdot d_{v}+d \\cdot d_{k}$ parameters. ${ }^{4}$\n\nIn Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ is obtained by combining a data-independent learnable matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ with a data-dependent vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}$, which allows the matrix to be full rank. However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/51 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n# Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training \n\nSonglin Yang ${ }^{1 *}$ Bailin Wang ${ }^{1 *}$ Yikang Shen ${ }^{2}$ Rameswar Panda ${ }^{2}$ Yoon Kim ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/71 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning, 2024.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 2. Towards Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks Construction with Spiking Activity based Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Yaxin Li, Qi Xu, Jiangrong Shen, Hongming Xu, Long Chen, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework, Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, which indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibiting high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need for compressing network models due to the presence of a significant number of redundant structural units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power consumption and biological interpretability advantages. Currently, most model compression techniques for SNNs are based on unstructured pruning of individual connections, which requires specific hardware support. Hence, we propose a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework. Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically adjusts the network's structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels during training, enhancing the model's adaptation to the current target task. While maintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture, ultimately reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process. This indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Parameter Efficient Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*H. Mostafa, Xin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network, and outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks are typically highly overparameterized. Pruning techniques are able to remove a significant fraction of network parameters with little loss in accuracy. Recently, techniques based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters have emerged, allowing direct training of sparse networks without having to pre-train a large dense model. Here we present a novel dynamic sparse reparameterization method that addresses the limitations of previous techniques such as high computational cost and the need for manual configuration of the number of free parameters allocated to each layer. We evaluate the performance of dynamic reallocation methods in training deep convolutional networks and show that our method outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget, on par with accuracies obtained by iteratively pruning a pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters were sufficient to explain the superior performance. Rather, effective learning crucially depended on the continuous exploration of the sparse network structure space during training. Our work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 285  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 4.

As a specific case, we consider estimating the Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the average discrepancy between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples. Furthermore, we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately and detecting mislabeled examples without expensive iterations over the entire dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Channel Gating Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Weizhe Hua, Christopher De Sa, Zhiru Zhang, G. Suh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An accelerator is designed for channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions. Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks achieves 2.7-8.0$\\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 2.0-4.4$\\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either FPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our accelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4$\\times$ on average, with a theoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8$\\times$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Instead of using backpropagation to learn features, GLNs have a distributed and local credit assignment mechanism based on optimizing a convex objective. This gives rise to many desirable properties including universality, data-efficient online learning, trivial interpretability and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We extend the GLN framework from classification to multiple regression and density modelling by generalizing geometric mixing to a product of Gaussian densities. The G-GLN achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on several univariate and multivariate regression benchmarks, and we demonstrate its applicability to practical tasks including online contextual bandits and density estimation via denoising.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Medical Transformer: Gated Axial-Attention for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Vishal M. Patel, Ilker Hacihaliloglu, Poojan Oza, Jeya Maria Jose Valanarasu*\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past decade, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have been widely adopted for medical image segmentation and shown to achieve adequate performance. However, due to the inherent inductive biases present in the convolutional architectures, they lack understanding of long-range dependencies in the image. Recently proposed Transformer-based architectures that leverage self-attention mechanism encode long-range dependencies and learn representations that are highly expressive. This motivates us to explore Transformer-based solutions and study the feasibility of using Transformer-based network architectures for medical image segmentation tasks. Majority of existing Transformer-based network architectures proposed for vision applications require large-scale datasets to train properly. However, compared to the datasets for vision applications, for medical imaging the number of data samples is relatively low, making it difficult to efficiently train transformers for medical applications. To this end, we propose a Gated Axial-Attention model which extends the existing architectures by introducing an additional control mechanism in the self-attention module. Furthermore, to train the model effectively on medical images, we propose a Local-Global training strategy (LoGo) which further improves the performance. Specifically, we operate on the whole image and patches to learn global and local features, respectively. The proposed Medical Transformer (MedT) is evaluated on three different medical image segmentation datasets and it is shown that it achieves better performance than the convolutional and other related transformer-based architectures.

These models eliminate unnecessary gating mechanisms, making them more efficient for parallel training and hardware execution. For instance, GRUs combine the input and forget gates into a single update gate, reducing the number of parameters and computational requirements.\n\n### Dynamic Gated Neural Networks\nThe dynamic gated neural network model described in the context of sensor fusion and edge computing demonstrates how gating mechanisms can be optimized for hardware efficiency. This model adapts the computing workload dynamically, integrating the gating mechanism during the inference phase to optimize the trade-off between accuracy, energy expense, and latency. This approach can be extended to language models by dynamically adjusting the computational resources based on the input characteristics.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nImplementations like FlashAttention and self-attention with O(1) or O(\u221an) memory complexity can be integrated with gating mechanisms to enhance efficiency. FlashAttention uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, resulting in significant speedups. Similar IO-aware designs can be applied to gating mechanisms in autoregressive models to improve performance[Analysis Note, References: \"FlashAttention\", \"Self-attention Does Not Need O(n\u00b2) Memory\"].\n\n### Sparse Attention\nSparse Modular Activation (SMA) and other sparse attention mechanisms can be integrated with gating mechanisms to reduce computational and memory requirements. SMA enables neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules, which can be applied to the gates in LSTMs or GRUs to maintain performance while reducing computation[Analysis Note, Reference: \"Sparse Modular Activation\"].\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\n\n### Cache-Aware Tiling Strategies\nCache-aware tiling strategies are crucial for performance optimization. By optimizing memory access patterns, these strategies can significantly reduce memory overhead, which is particularly important for autoregressive models that process long sequences. Implementing such strategies in the context of gating mechanisms can enhance overall efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Memory Compression Techniques\nMemory compression techniques can be applied to state management in autoregressive models. For example, compressing the cell state and hidden states in LSTMs or GRUs can help manage memory more efficiently. This can be combined with sparse computation techniques to further reduce memory requirements[Analysis Note, Future Search Plan].\n\n### Dynamic Gating for Resource Allocation\nThe dynamic gated neural network model discussed in the context of edge computing shows how gating mechanisms can be connected to infrastructure-level orchestrators to control resource allocation. This approach can be adapted to autoregressive language models to dynamically allocate resources based on the input characteristics, optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these concepts\u2014hardware-efficient gating designs, efficient attention mechanisms, and memory optimization techniques\u2014researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that perform well on various tasks while optimizing resource usage.\n",

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/29 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\n# HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion \n\n${ }^{1}$ Zhen Qin ${ }^{\\dagger},{ }^{2}$ Songlin Yang ${ }^{\\dagger},{ }^{3}$ Weixuan Sun, ${ }^{3}$ Xuyang Shen, ${ }^{3}$ Dong Li, ${ }^{3}$ Weigao Sun,<br>${ }^{3}$ Yiran Zhong*<br>${ }^{1}$ TapTap ${ }^{2}$ MIT CSAIL ${ }^{3}$ OpenNLPLab, Shanghai AI Lab<br>https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/HGRN2\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nHierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, Qin et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/97 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2404.05892, 2024.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Focused Hierarchical RNNs for Conditional Sequence Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Nan Rosemary Ke, Konrad Zolna, Alessandro Sordoni, Zhouhan Lin, Adam Trischler, Yoshua Bengio, Joelle Pineau, Laurent Charlin, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A mechanism for focusing RNN encoders for sequence modelling tasks which allows them to attend to key parts of the input as needed and generalize significantly better on synthetic tasks as compared to the baselines is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with attention mechanisms have obtained state-of-the-art results for many sequence processing tasks. Most of these models use a simple form of encoder with attention that looks over the entire sequence and assigns a weight to each token independently. We present a mechanism for focusing RNN encoders for sequence modelling tasks which allows them to attend to key parts of the input as needed. We formulate this using a multi-layer conditional sequence encoder that reads in one token at a time and makes a discrete decision on whether the token is relevant to the context or question being asked. The discrete gating mechanism takes in the context embedding and the current hidden state as inputs and controls information flow into the layer above. We train it using policy gradient methods. We evaluate this method on several types of tasks with different attributes. First, we evaluate the method on synthetic tasks which allow us to evaluate the model for its generalization ability and probe the behavior of the gates in more controlled settings. We then evaluate this approach on large scale Question Answering tasks including the challenging MS MARCO and SearchQA tasks. Our models shows consistent improvements for both tasks over prior work and our baselines. It has also shown to generalize significantly better on synthetic tasks as compared to the baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Improving the Gating Mechanism of Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Albert Gu, \u00c7aglar G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, T. Paine, Matthew W. Hoffman, Razvan Pascanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Gating mechanisms are widely used in neural network models, where they allow gradients to backpropagate more easily through depth or time. However, their saturation property introduces problems of its own. For example, in recurrent models these gates need to have outputs near 1 to propagate information over long time-delays, which requires them to operate in their saturation regime and hinders gradient-based learning of the gate mechanism. We address this problem by deriving two synergistic modifications to the standard gating mechanism that are easy to implement, introduce no additional hyperparameters, and improve learnability of the gates when they are close to saturation. We show how these changes are related to and improve on alternative recently proposed gating mechanisms such as chrono initialization and Ordered Neurons. Empirically, our simple gating mechanisms robustly improve the performance of recurrent models on a range of applications, including synthetic memorization tasks, sequential image classification, language modeling, and reinforcement learning, particularly when long-term dependencies are involved.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. GPT-ST: Generative Pre-Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Zhonghang Li, Lianghao Xia, Yong Xu, Chao Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a spatio-temporal pre- training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance, and introduces an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a rapid development of spatio-temporal prediction techniques in response to the increasing demands of traffic management and travel planning. While advanced end-to-end models have achieved notable success in improving predictive performance, their integration and expansion pose significant challenges. This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a spatio-temporal pre-training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance. The framework is built upon two key designs: (i) We propose a spatio-temporal mask autoencoder as a pre-training model for learning spatio-temporal dependencies. The model incorporates customized parameter learners and hierarchical spatial pattern encoding networks. These modules are specifically designed to capture spatio-temporal customized representations and intra- and inter-cluster region semantic relationships, which have often been neglected in existing approaches. (ii) We introduce an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism. This strategy guides the mask autoencoder in learning robust spatio-temporal representations and facilitates the modeling of different relationships, ranging from intra-cluster to inter-cluster, in an easy-to-hard training manner. Extensive experiments conducted on representative benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Dynamical Isometry and a Mean Field Theory of RNNs: Gating Enables Signal Propagation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Minmin Chen, Jeffrey Pennington, S. Schoenholz*\n\n**TL;DR:** A theory for signal propagation in recurrent networks after random initialization using a combination of mean field theory and random matrix theory is developed and it is shown that this theory predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have gained widespread use in modeling sequence data across various domains. While many successful recurrent architectures employ a notion of gating, the exact mechanism that enables such remarkable performance is not well understood. We develop a theory for signal propagation in recurrent networks after random initialization using a combination of mean field theory and random matrix theory. To simplify our discussion, we introduce a new RNN cell with a simple gating mechanism that we call the minimalRNN and compare it with vanilla RNNs. Our theory allows us to define a maximum timescale over which RNNs can remember an input. We show that this theory predicts trainability for both recurrent architectures. We show that gated recurrent networks feature a much broader, more robust, trainable region than vanilla RNNs, which corroborates recent experimental findings. Finally, we develop a closed-form critical initialization scheme that achieves dynamical isometry in both vanilla RNNs and minimalRNNs. We show that this results in significantly improvement in training dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that the minimalRNN achieves comparable performance to its more complex counterparts, such as LSTMs or GRUs, on a language modeling task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 112  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 5. Event Detection: Gate Diversity and Syntactic Importance Scores for Graph Convolution Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Viet Dac Lai, Tuan Ngo Nguyen, Thien Huu Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate and introduces novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies on event detection (ED) have shown that the syntactic dependency graph can be employed in graph convolution neural networks (GCN) to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, the computation of the hidden vectors in such graph-based models is agnostic to the trigger candidate words, potentially leaving irrelevant information for the trigger candidate for event prediction. In addition, the current models for ED fail to exploit the overall contextual importance scores of the words, which can be obtained via the dependency tree, to boost the performance. In this study, we propose a novel gating mechanism to filter noisy information in the hidden vectors of the GCN models for ED based on the information from the trigger candidate. We also introduce novel mechanisms to achieve the contextual diversity for the gates and the importance score consistency for the graphs and models in ED. The experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two ED datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts, a Flexible Framework for Large Language Models with Applications in Protein Mechanics and Molecular Design\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Markus J. Buehler, Eric L. Buehler*\n\n**Abstract:** We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Attentional Hybrid Neural Networks for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical gating mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Cleber Zanchettin, David Mac\u00eado, Luis Fred, Jader Abreu*\n\n**Abstract:** Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. The deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention recently. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The main contribution of this work is the use of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, generalizable and abstract features by the hierarchical representation. The proposed method in this paper improves the results of the current attention-based approaches for document classification.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-20\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Each gating level is a probability distribution over the next level of gatings, with experts at the leaf nodes. This approach can be highly efficient and scalable. For example, a 2-level hierarchical MoE would have a first-order gating function and second-order gating functions, leading to a weighted sum of expert outputs based on these gating functions.\n\n2. **Sparsely-Gated MoE Layer:**\n   This variant of MoE uses feedforward networks as experts and linear-softmax gating. It achieves sparsity by only considering the top-k experts, reducing computational overhead. The gating network is defined by a softmax function that keeps only the top-k entries, which helps in load balancing and efficiency.\n\n### State Management in Hierarchical Models\n\n1. **Hierarchical State Management:**\n   In hierarchical models, state management is crucial for maintaining efficiency and performance. Hierarchical MoE models, for instance, manage state by propagating weights through the tree structure, where each internal node determines the probabilities assigned to its children. This cumulative product of weights ensures that the final weight assigned to a leaf node is well-managed and efficient.\n\n2. **Memory Compression Techniques:**\n   To optimize memory usage, techniques such as compression can be integrated into hierarchical models. While the sources do not explicitly discuss compression in the context of MoE, the principle of hierarchical state management can be combined with compression techniques to reduce memory requirements, as hinted in the analysis note on memory management.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Attention-Gated Modules:**\n   Integrating attention mechanisms with hierarchical gating can enhance performance. For example, the hierarchical transformer architecture for ECG signal analysis uses an attention-gated module to learn associations between different leads. This module comprises linear layers that compute attention scores, which can be adapted to language models to model dependencies between different parts of the input sequence.\n\n2. **Combining Gating and Attention:**\n   The analysis note emphasizes the need for a careful balance between gating and attention mechanisms. In the context of hierarchical MoE, the gating networks can be designed to work in conjunction with attention mechanisms. For instance, the gating network can select the most relevant experts, and then attention mechanisms can be applied within these selected experts to further refine the outputs.\n\n### Implementation Insights\n\n1. **Dynamic and Adaptive Gating:**\n   Dynamic and adaptive gating mechanisms can improve efficiency while maintaining performance. This can be achieved by using techniques like sparsely-gated MoE layers, where the number of experts queried can be dynamically adjusted based on the input characteristics.\n\n2. **IO-Aware and Cache-Friendly Designs:**\n   Implementations should be IO-aware and cache-friendly to optimize performance. Tiling strategies, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be applied to reduce memory overhead and improve efficiency in hierarchical models[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these hierarchical gating mechanisms, integrating them with attention, and optimizing for hardware efficiency and memory management, researchers can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models, enhancing their performance, scalability, and efficiency.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/51 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nThis compression has two consequences. On one hand, mapping an input token $x_{t}$ to output token $z_{t}$ is efficient, because both the update rule and output rule take constant time per token. On the other hand, the performance of RNN layers in long context is limited by the expressive power of its hidden state $s_{t}$.

Top: A generic sequence modeling layer expressed as a hidden state that transitions according to an update rule. All sequence modeling layers can be viewed as different instantiations of three components in this figure: the initial state, update rule and output rule. Bottom: Examples of sequence modeling layers and their instantiations of the three components. The naive TTT layer was shown in Figure 1. Self-attention has a hidden state growing with context, therefore growing cost per token. Both the naive RNN and TTT layer compress the growing context into a hidden state of fixed size, therefore their cost per token stays constant. Self-attention can also be viewed from the perspective above, except that its hidden state, commonly known as the Key-Value (KV) cache, is a list that grows linearly with $t$. Its update rule simply appends the current KV tuple to this list, and the output rule scans over all tuples up to $t$ to form the attention matrix. The hidden state explicitly stores all historic context without compression, making self-attention more expressive than RNN layers for long context. However, scanning this linearly growing hidden state also takes linearly growing time per token. To remain both efficient and expressive in long context, we need a better compression heuristic. Specifically, we need to compress thousands or potentially millions of tokens into a hidden state that can effectively capture their underlying structures and relationships. This might sound like a tall order, but all of us are actually already familiar with such a heuristic. ### 2.1 TTT as updating a hidden state\n\nThe process of parametric learning can be viewed as compressing a massive training set into the weights of a model. Specifically, we know that models trained with self-supervision can capture the underlying structures and relationships behind their training data [48] - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. LLMs themselves are great examples. Trained with the self-supervised task of next-token prediction, their weights can be viewed as a compressed form of storage for existing knowledge on the internet. By querying LLMs, we can extract knowledge from their weights. More importantly, LLMs often exhibit a deep understanding of the semantic connections among existing knowledge to express new pieces of reasoning [1]. Our key idea is to use self-supervised learning to compress the historic context $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$ into a hidden state $s_{t}$, by making the context an unlabeled dataset and the state a model. Concretely, the hidden state $s_{t}$ is now equivalent to $W_{t}$, the weights of a model $f$, which can be a linear model, a\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-05.jpg?height=354&width=1491&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 5.

Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Zhiwei Deng, Olga Russakovsky*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

Many successful building blocks, e.g. inception and residual modules, have been designed to refresh state-of-the-art records of CNNs on visual recognition tasks. Beyond these high-level modules, we suggest that an ordinary \ufb01lter in the neural network can be upgraded to a sophisticated module as well.

Recently, there has been significant interest in utilizing this information in the context of deep neural networks; however, relatively little is known about the quality of existing approximations in this context. Our work examines this question, identifies issues with existing approaches, and proposes a method called WoodFisher to compute a faithful and efficient estimate of the inverse Hessian. \nOur main application is to neural network compression, where we build on the classic Optimal Brain Damage/Surgeon framework. We demonstrate that WoodFisher significantly outperforms popular state-of-the-art methods for one-shot pruning. Further, even when iterative, gradual pruning is considered, our method results in a gain in test accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches, for pruning popular neural networks (like ResNet-50, MobileNetV1) trained on standard image classification datasets such as ImageNet ILSVRC.

To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 62  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 2.

An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds.

In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dataset Distillation with Infinitely Wide Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Jaehoon Lee, Lechao Xiao, Roman Novak, Timothy Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms arises from being able to extract useful features from large amounts of data. As model and dataset sizes increase, dataset distillation methods that compress large datasets into significantly smaller yet highly performant ones will become valuable in terms of training efficiency and useful feature extraction. To that end, we apply a novel distributed kernel based meta-learning framework to achieve state-of-the-art results for dataset distillation using infinitely wide convolutional neural networks. For instance, using only 10 datapoints (0.02% of original dataset), we obtain over 65% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification task, a dramatic improvement over the previous best test accuracy of 40%. Our state-of-the-art results extend across many other settings for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Furthermore, we perform some preliminary analyses of our distilled datasets to shed light on how they differ from naturally occurring data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state compression, memory-efficient state representations, compression methods for hidden states, and hardware-efficient compression strategies, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Representations\n\n### Hierarchical State Management\nThe analysis note highlights the importance of hierarchical gating mechanisms and state management. Techniques like outer-product-based state expansion, as mentioned in \"HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion,\" can significantly enlarge the recurrent state size without adding parameters, making it a memory-efficient approach.\n\n### Compression and Expansion\nBalancing compression and expansion of states is crucial. Hierarchical compression and expansion of states, as suggested, can help in managing memory efficiently. This approach ensures that upper layers model long-term dependencies while lower layers handle short-term dependencies, optimizing memory usage.\n\n## Compression Methods for Hidden States\n\n### Pruning and Feature Selection\nParameter pruning techniques, such as those discussed in the context of Bayesian neural networks, can be adapted for autoregressive models. By assigning relevance scores to parameters and pruning less relevant ones, models can be compressed while maintaining accuracy. Variational dropout and other Bayesian compression methods can also be applied to reduce the dimensionality of hidden states.\n\n### Quantization and Tensorization\nQuantization and tensorization methods, as described in \"Ultimate Compression: Joint Method of Quantization and Tensor Decomposition,\" can be applied to compress hidden states. These methods reduce the precision of weights and activations, leading to significant memory savings without a substantial loss in accuracy.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Compression Strategies\n\n### Linear Attention Forms\nUsing linear attention forms, as mentioned in the analysis note, can provide hardware efficiency. Gated linear attention mechanisms reduce memory bandwidth requirements and are more amenable to hardware optimization.\n\n### Multi-Query Attention\nMulti-query attention mechanisms can also reduce memory bandwidth requirements, making them more hardware-efficient. This is particularly useful in autoregressive models where sequential processing is common.\n\n### Dynamic and Adaptive Routing\nDynamic and adaptive routing mechanisms can enhance the adaptability of the model while optimizing hardware usage. These mechanisms can be integrated with hierarchical gating to ensure efficient state management and compression.\n\n## Additional Strategies\n\n### Autoencoders\nAutoencoders, discussed in the YouTube video, can be used for data compression and feature detection. While not directly applied to autoregressive models, the concept of encoding and decoding data can be adapted to compress hidden states efficiently.\n\n### Optimizers and Preconditioning\nEfficient optimizers like Shampoo, which store preconditioners, can help in faster convergence and more efficient training. This can indirectly support the goal of efficient state compression by optimizing the training process.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of memory usage but also optimized for hardware performance, leading to better scalability and overall performance.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2307.14995, 2023b.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

This specific integration is novel and not extensively covered in existing literature.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n- **Effectiveness and Adaptability**: Gating mechanisms, such as Gated Linear Units (GLUs) and Gated Linear Attention (GLA), are effective in controlling information flow and enhancing model expressiveness. Studies like *Griffin* and *Mamba* have successfully utilized gating in different contexts, supporting the feasibility of integrating these mechanisms into GAUs.\n- **Dynamic Control**: Gating allows dynamic adjustments over time, enabling the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the input. This is highlighted in works like *Mamba* and *GLA*.\n\n## Graph-Inspired Convolutional Operations\n- **Global Dependencies**: Integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can help capture global dependencies that traditional sequential models struggle with. This is demonstrated in research by *Marcheggiani & Titov (2019)* and *Nguyen et al. (2023)*.\n- **Efficiency**: To address potential computational overhead, efficient graph convolution techniques such as approximate or sparse graph convolutions are necessary. Works like *Passaro & Zitnick (2023)* and *Makadia et al. (2023)* provide insights into efficient implementations.\n\n## Test-Time Training (TTT)\n- **Adaptability**: TTT enables models to adapt during inference, which is valuable in the presence of distribution shifts or novel inputs. Studies like *Sun et al. (2019)* and *Huang et al. (2022)* emphasize the importance of TTT for generalization under distribution shifts.\n\n## Computational Efficiency and Scalability\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Techniques from *Fu et al. (2023)* and *Passaro & Zitnick (2023)* are relevant for maintaining scalability and efficiency. For example, simple hardware-efficient long convolutions and efficient equivariant GNNs can help mitigate computational overhead.\n\n## Relevant Mechanisms and Architectures\n- **Rodimus Block**: The Rodimus block, which integrates Gated Linear Units (GLUs) and compact architecture, demonstrates greater parameter efficiency and sub-quadratic computational complexity during training. This could be a useful reference for designing efficient GAU blocks.\n- **Irregular Gated Mechanism**: The use of irregular gated mechanisms to adaptively control information, as seen in the MTSFormer model, can be beneficial for handling varied inputs and capturing complex patterns.\n\n## Key Insights for Implementation\n- **Data-Dependent Gating**: Allowing gating mechanisms to be functions of the input enables dynamic adjustments, which has been validated by superior performance in models like GLA and gRetNet.\n- **Temperature Gate**: Introducing a temperature gate (\u03c4t) that governs the sharpness of the selection gate can provide additional flexibility and robustness against noise, as seen in recent findings.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researcher can design a novel LM block that:\n- Utilizes gating mechanisms (like GLUs and GLA) for dynamic control over information flow.\n- Incorporates graph-inspired convolutional operations to capture global dependencies efficiently.\n- Ensures compatibility with test-time training to enhance adaptability.\n- Implements hardware-efficient methods to maintain scalability and computational efficiency.\n\nThis approach has the potential to significantly improve model perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and overall scalability.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",
            "analysis": "**Analysis Note:**\n\n---\n\n**1. Summary of Analysis:**\n\nThe proposal aims to enhance the TTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations to better capture both local and global dependencies during test-time training (TTT). The key objectives are to improve model perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, computational efficiency, and scalability.\n\nThrough the analysis of internal and external research papers, as well as web search results, it appears that while gating mechanisms and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been individually incorporated into language models, the specific combination of integrating both into TTTLinear GAUs for the purpose of enhancing test-time training adaptability is novel.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/15 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_539af27a11cae64ab314g-09.jpg?height=413&width=856&top_left_y=1105&top_left_x=626)\n\nFigure 8: We plot the state transitions of the trained model for a random test input batch at layers 0 and 8 . We observe structured patterns in the data-controlled state transition. While we leave interpretability for future work, we point out that these patterns indicate that the trained model deliberately utilizes the data-controlled gating of the state transition (and thus forgetting and retention of memories) by applying large varieties of magnitudes and phases. ## 6 Future Work\n\nWhile our primary focus in this paper is to establish the groundwork for constructing fully datacontrolled linear RNNs, we recognize the multitude of opportunities for future research. One avenue involves exploring the effects of different initialization strategies, amplitude- and phase-activations. Moreover, we suggest that future work should pay focus to the interpretability of the learned state transitions for gaining deeper insights into the model's inner workings. ## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe introduce GateLoop, a fully data-controlled linear RNN which generalizes existing linear recurrent models by leveraging data controlled gating of inputs and outputs and state transitions. While our method comes with linear runtime complexity $O(l)$, we derive an efficient parallelizable $O(l \\log l)$ training strategy utilizing parallel scans. Furthermore, GateLoop can be reformulated in an equivalent $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ surrogate attention mode which reveals, that its mechanism can be interpreted as providing relative positional information to Attention. Finally we validate empirically, that fully data-controlled linear recurrence is highly performant for autoregressive language modeling. ## REFERENCES\n\nGuy Blelloch.

Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates.

Instead of using backpropagation to learn features, GLNs have a distributed and local credit assignment mechanism based on optimizing a convex objective. This gives rise to many desirable properties including universality, data-efficient online learning, trivial interpretability and robustness to catastrophic forgetting. We extend the GLN framework from classification to multiple regression and density modelling by generalizing geometric mixing to a product of Gaussian densities. The G-GLN achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on several univariate and multivariate regression benchmarks, and we demonstrate its applicability to practical tasks including online contextual bandits and density estimation via denoising.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutional Networks*\n\n*Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr., Kilian Q. Weinberger, Tianyi Zhang, Tao Yu, Felix Wu, Christopher Fifty*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have experienced significant attention and have become the de facto methods for learning graph representations. GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper, we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-19\n\n\n\n#### 4. Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutional Networks*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Wei-Lin Chiang, Yang Li, Si Si, Samy Bengio, Xuanqing Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 6. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the TTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Specific Gating Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on RWKV6 provides valuable insights into advanced gating mechanisms. It discusses the use of a more flexible gating mechanism and introduces multi-headed matrix-valued states, which can boost the model's memory and adaptability. The concept of a temperature gate (\\(\\tau_t\\)) that governs the sharpness of the selection gate is particularly relevant, as it allows for dynamic adjustments based on the input \\(x_t\\).\n- The comparison with other methods like Mamba, Mamba2, and HGRN2 highlights the benefits of having \\(A_t\\) and \\(B_t\\) negatively correlated, enabling better regulation of information flow.\n\n## Graph-Inspired Convolutional Operations\n\n- The concept of integrating graph convolutional networks (GCNs) into language models can be informed by the work on global and local Transformer blocks. The idea of using efficient gated attention (EGA) for global dependency capture and convolutional local attention (CLA) for local contexts is promising. This approach avoids the redundancy and inefficiencies of dual-path models and can directly process long sequences without chunking.\n- GCNs can model relationships in data represented as graphs, which could be adapted to capture global dependencies in sequential data. This integration can potentially enhance the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n## Computational Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The RWKV6 paper discusses the computational efficiency of the Rodimus block, which retains a fixed-size hidden state during inference, resulting in \\(O(1)\\) time and space complexity. During training, the chunkwise parallelization ensures sub-quadratic computational complexity, which is crucial for scalability.\n- The global and local Transformer block design also emphasizes efficiency by avoiding the need for chunking and dual-path processing, which reduces computational overhead.\n\n## Novelty and Comparison to Existing Work\n\n- The proposal to integrate gating mechanisms and graph convolutions into TTTLinear GAUs appears novel, especially in the context of test-time training. However, similar approaches have been explored in other contexts, such as the Mossformer, which uses an efficient gate attention unit (GAU) mechanism.\n- Comparing the current proposal with existing works like RWKV6, which enhances the GAU with advanced gating mechanisms, and the global and local Transformer blocks, which efficiently handle long sequences, will help in understanding the novelty and potential improvements.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Gating Mechanisms\n- Gating mechanisms can be highly beneficial for dynamic adaptation and control of information flow. The use of temperature gates and data-dependent adjustments can enhance the model's robustness and performance.\n\n### Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\n- GCNs can effectively capture global dependencies by modeling relationships in sequential data. Integrating GCNs into the GAU architecture could significantly improve the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n### Test-Time Training (TTT)\n- The modifications proposed should be evaluated in the context of TTT to ensure they enhance the model's adaptability during inference. The ability to update parameters based on incoming data is crucial for test-time training, and the gating mechanisms and GCNs should be designed to support this functionality.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Literature Review\n- Search for recent papers on integrating gating mechanisms into linear attention models or GAUs, such as the RWKV6 paper.\n- Look for studies on combining GCNs with language models, especially those focusing on autoregressive models and test-time adaptation.\n- Investigate computational efficiency and scalability concerns in similar models.\n\n### Prior Design Proposals\n- Examine previous design proposals that integrate similar mechanisms into GAUs or other autoregressive models.\n- Identify existing implementations or experiments that provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of these modifications.\n\n### Impact Assessment\n- Seek empirical evidence on how gating mechanisms and graph convolutions affect model performance metrics.\n- Explore theoretical analyses on the trade-offs between model complexity and performance gains resulting from these integrations.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to enhance the TTTLinear GAU with gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations, ensuring improved performance, adaptability, and computational efficiency.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

State Space Models are Comparable to Transformers in Estimating Functions with Dynamic Smoothness (Avg.

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nY.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 145  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 2.

We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks. Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully parallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length.

Khudia, Jonathan Frankle*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto optimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large, enabling researchers and engineers to pretrain custom BERT-style models at low cost instead of finetune on existing generic models.\n\n**Abstract:** Although BERT-style encoder models are heavily used in NLP research, many researchers do not pretrain their own BERTs from scratch due to the high cost of training. In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many advances have been made with other transformer architectures and training configurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here, we introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe that is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture incorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear Units (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision LayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe includes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective, bfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in addition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When pretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a downstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs at a cost of roughly $20. We plot extensive accuracy vs. pretraining speed Pareto curves and show that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto optimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large. This empirical speed up in pretraining enables researchers and engineers to pretrain custom BERT-style models at low cost instead of finetune on existing generic models.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutions in Language Models*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity.

So*\n\n**TL;DR:** EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the recent impressive accomplishments of language models (LMs) for code generation, we explore the use of LMs as adaptive mutation and crossover operators for an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. While NAS still proves too difficult a task for LMs to succeed at solely through prompting, we find that the combination of evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt-tuning, a method we term EvoPrompting, consistently finds diverse and high performing models. We first demonstrate that EvoPrompting is effective on the computationally efficient MNIST-1D dataset, where EvoPrompting produces convolutional architecture variants that outperform both those designed by human experts and naive few-shot prompting in terms of accuracy and model size. We then apply our method to searching for graph neural networks on the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, where EvoPrompting is able to design novel architectures that outperform current state-of-the-art models on 21 out of 30 algorithmic reasoning tasks while maintaining similar model size. EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Graph Convolutions over Constituent Trees for Syntax-Aware Semantic Role Labeling\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutions in Language Models*\n\n*Diego Marcheggiani, Ivan Titov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can be used to encode constituent structures and inform an SRL system, and evaluates SpanGCN against alternatives, including a model using GCNs over dependency trees, and shows its effectiveness on standard CoNLL-2005, CoNll-2012, and FrameNet benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying predicates and labeling argument spans with semantic roles. Even though most semantic-role formalisms are built upon constituent syntax and only syntactic constituents can be labeled as arguments (e.g., FrameNet and PropBank), all the recent work on syntax-aware SRL relies on dependency representations of syntax. In contrast, we show how graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can be used to encode constituent structures and inform an SRL system. Nodes in our SpanGCN correspond to constituents. The computation is done in 3 stages. First, initial node representations are produced by `composing' word representations of the first and the last word in the constituent. Second, graph convolutions relying on the constituent tree are performed, yielding syntactically-informed constituent representations. Finally, the constituent representations are `decomposed' back into word representations which in turn are used as input to the SRL classifier. We evaluate SpanGCN against alternatives, including a model using GCNs over dependency trees, and show its effectiveness on standard CoNLL-2005, CoNLL-2012, and FrameNet benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7.

Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training with Gated Mechanisms*\n\n*Runzhe Zhan, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

Extrapolative Continuous-time Bayesian Neural Network for Fast Training-free Test-time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training with Gated Mechanisms*\n\n*Hengguan Huang, Xiangming Gu, Hongya Wang, Chang Xiao, Hongfu Liu, Ye Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to formulate internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context and develops extrap-olative continuous-time Bayesian neural networks (ECBNN 2 ), which generalize existing Bayesian neural networks to represent temporal dynamics and allow us to extrapolate the distribution of model parameters before observing the incoming data, therefore effectively reducing the latency.\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence has shown remarkably lower latency and higher precision than most AI systems when processing non-stationary streaming data in real-time. Numerous neuroscience studies suggest that such abilities may be driven by internal predictive modeling. In this paper, we explore the possibility of introducing such a mechanism in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for handling non-stationary streaming data for real-time streaming applications. We propose to formulate internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context. Such a dynamical system describes the dynamics of model parameters of a UDA model evolving with non-stationary streaming data. Building on such a dynamical system, we then develop extrap-olative continuous-time Bayesian neural networks (ECBNN 2 ), which generalize existing Bayesian neural networks to represent temporal dynamics and allow us to extrapolate the distribution of model parameters before observing the incoming data, therefore effectively reducing the latency. Remarkably, our empirical results show that ECBNN is capable of continuously generating better distributions of model parameters along the time axis given historical data only, thereby achieving (1) training-free test-time adaptation with low latency, (2) gradually improved alignment between the source and target features and (3) gradually improved model performance over time during the real-time testing stage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Models*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Models*\n\n*Caglar Gulcehre, Nando de Freitas, Razvan Pascanu, Yee Whye Teh, David Budden, Arnaud Doucet, Guillaume Desjardins, Srivatsan Srinivasan, Yutian Chen, Leonard Berrada, Ruba Haroun, Albert Gu, George Cristian-Muraru, Aleksandar Botev, Anushan Fernando, Samuel L. Smith, Soham De*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have fast inference and scale efficiently on long sequences, but they are difficult to train and hard to scale. We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. ViCGCN: Graph Convolutional Network with Contextualized Language Models for Social Media Mining in Vietnamese\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutions in Language Models*\n\n*Kiet Van Nguyen, Trong-Hop Do, Chi-Thanh Dang, Quoc-Nam Nguyen, Chau-Thang Phan*\n\n**Abstract:** Social media processing is a fundamental task in natural language processing with numerous applications. As Vietnamese social media and information science have grown rapidly, the necessity of information-based mining on Vietnamese social media has become crucial. However, state-of-the-art research faces several significant drawbacks, including imbalanced data and noisy data on social media platforms. Imbalanced and noisy are two essential issues that need to be addressed in Vietnamese social media texts. Graph Convolutional Networks can address the problems of imbalanced and noisy data in text classification on social media by taking advantage of the graph structure of the data. This study presents a novel approach based on contextualized language model (PhoBERT) and graph-based method (Graph Convolutional Networks). In particular, the proposed approach, ViCGCN, jointly trained the power of Contextualized embeddings with the ability of Graph Convolutional Networks, GCN, to capture more syntactic and semantic dependencies to address those drawbacks. Extensive experiments on various Vietnamese benchmark datasets were conducted to verify our approach. The observation shows that applying GCN to BERTology models as the final layer significantly improves performance. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that ViCGCN outperforms 13 powerful baseline models, including BERTology models, fusion BERTology and GCN models, other baselines, and SOTA on three benchmark social media datasets. Our proposed ViCGCN approach demonstrates a significant improvement of up to 6.21%, 4.61%, and 2.63% over the best Contextualized Language Models, including multilingual and monolingual, on three benchmark datasets, UIT-VSMEC, UIT-ViCTSD, and UIT-VSFC, respectively. Additionally, our integrated model ViCGCN achieves the best performance compared to other BERTology integrated with GCN models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 4. DKN: Deep Knowledge-Aware Network for News Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutions in Language Models*\n\n*Xing Xie, Hongwei Wang, Minyi Guo, Fuzheng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Online news recommender systems aim to address the information explosion of\nnews and make personalized recommendation for users. In general, news language\nis highly condensed, full of knowledge entities and common sense. However,\nexisting methods are unaware of such external knowledge and cannot fully\ndiscover latent knowledge-level connections among news. The recommended results\nfor a user are consequently limited to simple patterns and cannot be extended\nreasonably. Moreover, news recommendation also faces the challenges of high\ntime-sensitivity of news and dynamic diversity of users' interests. To solve\nthe above problems, in this paper, we propose a deep knowledge-aware network\n(DKN) that incorporates knowledge graph representation into news\nrecommendation. DKN is a content-based deep recommendation framework for\nclick-through rate prediction. The key component of DKN is a multi-channel and\nword-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network (KCNN) that\nfuses semantic-level and knowledge-level representations of news. KCNN treats\nwords and entities as multiple channels, and explicitly keeps their alignment\nrelationship during convolution. In addition, to address users' diverse\ninterests, we also design an attention module in DKN to dynamically aggregate a\nuser's history with respect to current candidate news. Through extensive\nexperiments on a real online news platform, we demonstrate that DKN achieves\nsubstantial gains over state-of-the-art deep recommendation models. We also\nvalidate the efficacy of the usage of knowledge in DKN.\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Test-Time Training with Gated Mechanisms*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Works like *Gated Linear Attention Transformers* by Yang et al. (2023) and *Griffin* by De et al. (2024) have shown promising results by integrating gating into linear attention and recurrent models, respectively. These studies highlight the potential for improved performance and efficiency.\n\n### Graph Convolutions in Sequence Modeling\n- The integration of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) into sequence modeling is a critical aspect. While GCNs are primarily used in graph-structured data, adapting them to capture global dependencies in sequential data could be beneficial. The foundational work by Kipf and Welling (2016) on GCNs provides a starting point, but the challenge lies in practical integration into autoregressive models.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n- Ensuring the computational efficiency and scalability of the modified model is crucial. The use of dilated convolutions, as seen in the Temporal Dilated Convolution (TC) block described in the arXiv paper (2024), can help capture long-range dependencies without significant computational overhead. This approach could be adapted to integrate with gating mechanisms and GCNs.\n\n## Test-Time Training and Adaptation\n- The researcher aims to enhance test-time training (TTT) capabilities. Studies like *Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision for Generalization under Distribution Shifts* by Sun et al. (2019) are relevant, as they discuss TTT mechanisms and their importance in adapting to distribution shifts. Integrating advanced mechanisms like gating and GCNs into TTT frameworks needs careful consideration to maintain stability and performance during test-time adaptation.\n\n## Relevant Concepts and Techniques\n\n### Global and Local Transformer Blocks\n- The concept of global and local Transformer blocks, as described in the arXiv paper on asymmetric encoder-decoder models (2024), is particularly relevant. This approach uses efficient gated attention (EGA) for global context and convolutional local attention (CLA) for local contexts, which could be adapted to integrate with gating mechanisms and GCNs.\n\n### Multi-View Self-Attention and Fusion\n- Techniques like multi-view self-attention and fusion, mentioned in the same arXiv paper, can help in exchanging and preserving information between different views, which might be useful in combining the outputs of gating mechanisms and GCNs.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Investigate GCNs in Language Models\n- Search for recent research on integrating GCNs or graph-based operations into autoregressive language models. For example, looking into how GCNs can be adapted to capture global dependencies in sequence data.\n\n### Explore Gated Mechanisms\n- Delve deeper into works on gated linear attention models to understand implementation details and performance implications. Identify methods to integrate gating mechanisms without significant computational costs.\n\n### Assess Computational Efficiency\n- Look for strategies to balance performance improvements with computational overhead. Explore hardware-efficient training methods that could support the proposed modifications.\n\n### Examine Test-Time Training\n- Investigate how models with complex architectures handle test-time adaptation. Search for studies on maintaining stability and performance during test-time training when integrating additional mechanisms.\n\n## Specific Search Queries\n\n- **Keywords:**\n  - `Gated Linear Attention Models`\n  - `Graph Convolutions in Language Models`\n  - `Test-Time Training with Gated Mechanisms`\n  - `Efficient Integration of GCNs and Gating Mechanisms`\n  - `Hardware-Efficient Training for Advanced LM Blocks`\n\n- **Description:**\n  - Research on integrating graph convolutional networks and gating mechanisms into autoregressive language models, focusing on models that support test-time adaptation and aim to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Automatic Rule Induction for Efficient Semi-Supervised Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Integration in Sequence Models*\n\n*Reid Pryzant, Ziyi Yang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Michael Zeng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Automatic Rule Induction (ARI) is proposed, a simple and general-purpose framework for the automatic discovery and integration of symbolic rules into pretrained transformer models that can improve state-of-the-art methods with no manual effort and minimal computational overhead.\n\n**Abstract:** Semi-supervised learning has shown promise in allowing NLP models to generalize from small amounts of labeled data. Meanwhile, pretrained transformer models act as black-box correlation engines that are difficult to explain and sometimes behave unreliably. In this paper, we propose tackling both of these challenges via Automatic Rule Induction (ARI), a simple and general-purpose framework for the automatic discovery and integration of symbolic rules into pretrained transformer models. First, we extract weak symbolic rules from low-capacity machine learning models trained on small amounts of labeled data. Next, we use an attention mechanism to integrate these rules into high-capacity pretrained transformer models. Last, the rule-augmented system becomes part of a self-training framework to boost supervision signal on unlabeled data. These steps can be layered beneath a variety of existing weak supervision and semi-supervised NLP algorithms in order to improve performance and interpretability. Experiments across nine sequence classification and relation extraction tasks suggest that ARI can improve state-of-the-art methods with no manual effort and minimal computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. DePT: Decomposed Prompt Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Integration in Sequence Models*\n\n*Zhengxiang Shi, Aldo Lipani*\n\n**TL;DR:** Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT) is proposed, which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates, allowing DePT to achieve better performance while saving substantial memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT and its variants.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt tuning (PT), where a small amount of trainable soft (continuous) prompt vectors is affixed to the input of language models (LM), has shown promising results across various tasks and models for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). PT stands out from other PEFT approaches because it maintains competitive performance with fewer trainable parameters and does not drastically scale up its parameters as the model size expands. However, PT introduces additional soft prompt tokens, leading to longer input sequences, which significantly impacts training and inference time and memory usage due to the Transformer's quadratic complexity. Particularly concerning for Large Language Models (LLMs) that face heavy daily querying. To address this issue, we propose Decomposed Prompt Tuning (DePT), which decomposes the soft prompt into a shorter soft prompt and a pair of low-rank matrices that are then optimised with two different learning rates. This allows DePT to achieve better performance while saving substantial memory and time costs compared to vanilla PT and its variants, without changing trainable parameter sizes. Through extensive experiments on 23 natural language processing (NLP) and vision-language (VL) tasks, we demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT approaches, including the full fine-tuning baseline, in some scenarios. Additionally, we empirically show that DEPT grows more efficient as the model size increases. Our further study reveals that DePT integrates seamlessly with parameter-efficient transfer learning in the few-shot learning setting and highlights its adaptability to various model architectures and sizes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Parameterizing Context: Unleashing the Power of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and In-Context Tuning for Continual Table Semantic Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Integration in Sequence Models*\n\n*Yongrui Chen, Shenyu Zhang, Guilin Qi, Xinnan Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental evaluations on two benchmarks affirm the superiority of the proposed PEFT framework over prevalent few-shot and continual learning baselines across various metrics.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual table semantic parsing aims to train a parser on a sequence of tasks, where each task requires the parser to translate natural language into SQL based on task-specific tables but only offers limited training examples. Conventional methods tend to suffer from overfitting with limited supervision, as well as catastrophic forgetting due to parameter updates. Despite recent advancements that partially alleviate these issues through semi-supervised data augmentation and retention of a few past examples, the performance is still limited by the volume of unsupervised data and stored examples. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel method integrating \\textit{parameter-efficient fine-tuning} (PEFT) and \\textit{in-context tuning} (ICT) for training a continual table semantic parser. Initially, we present a task-adaptive PEFT framework capable of fully circumventing catastrophic forgetting, which is achieved by freezing the pre-trained model backbone and fine-tuning small-scale prompts. Building on this, we propose a teacher-student framework-based solution. The teacher addresses the few-shot problem using ICT, which procures contextual information by demonstrating a few training examples. In turn, the student leverages the proposed PEFT framework to learn from the teacher's output distribution, and subsequently compresses and saves the contextual information to the prompts, eliminating the need to store any training examples. Experimental evaluations on two benchmarks affirm the superiority of our method over prevalent few-shot and continual learning baselines across various metrics.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

Numerous neuroscience studies suggest that such abilities may be driven by internal predictive modeling. In this paper, we explore the possibility of introducing such a mechanism in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for handling non-stationary streaming data for real-time streaming applications. We propose to formulate internal predictive modeling as a continuous-time Bayesian filtering problem within a stochastic dynamical system context. Such a dynamical system describes the dynamics of model parameters of a UDA model evolving with non-stationary streaming data. Building on such a dynamical system, we then develop extrap-olative continuous-time Bayesian neural networks (ECBNN 2 ), which generalize existing Bayesian neural networks to represent temporal dynamics and allow us to extrapolate the distribution of model parameters before observing the incoming data, therefore effectively reducing the latency. Remarkably, our empirical results show that ECBNN is capable of continuously generating better distributions of model parameters along the time axis given historical data only, thereby achieving (1) training-free test-time adaptation with low latency, (2) gradually improved alignment between the source and target features and (3) gradually improved model performance over time during the real-time testing stage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Reducing SO(3) Convolutions to SO(2) for Efficient Equivariant GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Efficient Graph Convolutions*\n\n*Saro Passaro, C. L.

Unfortunately equivariant convolutions, which are a fundamental operation for equivariant networks, increase significantly in computational complexity as higher-order tensors are used. In this paper, we address this issue by reducing the $SO(3)$ convolutions or tensor products to mathematically equivalent convolutions in $SO(2)$ . This is accomplished by aligning the node embeddings' primary axis with the edge vectors, which sparsifies the tensor product and reduces the computational complexity from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is the degree of the representation. We demonstrate the potential implications of this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical Channel Network (eSCN), a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20 and OC-22 datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SkeletonMAE: Graph-based Masked Autoencoder for Skeleton Sequence Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Integration in Sequence Models*\n\n*Liang Lin, Guanbin Li, Zhen Li, Yushen Wei, Yang Liu, Hong Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** Skeleton sequence representation learning has shown great advantages for action recognition due to its promising ability to model human joints and topology. However, the current methods usually require sufficient labeled data for training computationally expensive models, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Moreover, these methods ignore how to utilize the fine-grained dependencies among different skeleton joints to pre-train an efficient skeleton sequence learning model that can generalize well across different datasets. In this paper, we propose an efficient skeleton sequence learning framework, named Skeleton Sequence Learning (SSL). To comprehensively capture the human pose and obtain discriminative skeleton sequence representation, we build an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder pre-training architecture named SkeletonMAE, which embeds skeleton joint sequence into Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and reconstructs the masked skeleton joints and edges based on the prior human topology knowledge. Then, the pre-trained SkeletonMAE encoder is integrated with the Spatial-Temporal Representation Learning (STRL) module to build the SSL framework. Extensive experimental results show that our SSL generalizes well across different datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition methods on FineGym, Diving48, NTU 60 and NTU 120 datasets. Additionally, we obtain comparable performance to some fully supervised methods.

Simba: Mamba augmented U-ShiftGCN for Skeletal Action Recognition in Videos\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Integration in Sequence Models*\n\n*Saumik Bhattacharya, Soumyabrata Chaudhuri*\n\n**Abstract:** Skeleton Action Recognition (SAR) involves identifying human actions using skeletal joint coordinates and their interconnections. While plain Transformers have been attempted for this task, they still fall short compared to the current leading methods, which are rooted in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) due to the absence of structural priors. Recently, a novel selective state space model, Mamba, has surfaced as a compelling alternative to the attention mechanism in Transformers, offering efficient modeling of long sequences. In this work, to the utmost extent of our awareness, we present the first SAR framework incorporating Mamba. Each fundamental block of our model adopts a novel U-ShiftGCN architecture with Mamba as its core component. The encoder segment of the U-ShiftGCN is devised to extract spatial features from the skeletal data using downsampling vanilla Shift S-GCN blocks. These spatial features then undergo intermediate temporal modeling facilitated by the Mamba block before progressing to the encoder section, which comprises vanilla upsampling Shift S-GCN blocks. Additionally, a Shift T-GCN (ShiftTCN) temporal modeling unit is employed before the exit of each fundamental block to refine temporal representations. This particular integration of downsampling spatial, intermediate temporal, upsampling spatial, and ultimate temporal subunits yields promising results for skeleton action recognition. We dub the resulting model \\textbf{Simba}, which attains state-of-the-art performance across three well-known benchmark skeleton action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and Northwestern-UCLA. Interestingly, U-ShiftGCN (Simba without Intermediate Mamba Block) by itself is capable of performing reasonably well and surpasses our baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gating Mechanisms in Test-Time Training*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Scaling Spherical CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Efficient Graph Convolutions*\n\n*Ameesh Makadia, Jean-Jacques Slotine, Carlos Esteves*\n\n**Abstract:** Spherical CNNs generalize CNNs to functions on the sphere, by using spherical convolutions as the main linear operation. The most accurate and efficient way to compute spherical convolutions is in the spectral domain (via the convolution theorem), which is still costlier than the usual planar convolutions. For this reason, applications of spherical CNNs have so far been limited to small problems that can be approached with low model capacity. In this work, we show how spherical CNNs can be scaled for much larger problems. To achieve this, we make critical improvements including novel variants of common model components, an implementation of core operations to exploit hardware accelerator characteristics, and application-specific input representations that exploit the properties of our model. Experiments show our larger spherical CNNs reach state-of-the-art on several targets of the QM9 molecular benchmark, which was previously dominated by equivariant graph neural networks, and achieve competitive performance on multiple weather forecasting tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/google-research/spherical-cnn.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. I-ViT: Integer-only Quantization for Efficient Vision Transformer Inference\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Efficient Graph Convolutions*\n\n*Qingyi Gu, Zhikai Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various computer vision applications. However, these models have considerable storage and computational overheads, making their deployment and efficient inference on edge devices challenging. Quantization is a promising approach to reducing model complexity, and the dyadic arithmetic pipeline can allow the quantized models to perform efficient integer-only inference. Unfortunately, dyadic arithmetic is based on the homogeneity condition in convolutional neural networks, which is not applicable to the non-linear components in ViTs, making integer-only inference of ViTs an open issue. In this paper, we propose I-ViT, an integer-only quantization scheme for ViTs, to enable ViTs to perform the entire computational graph of inference with integer arithmetic and bit-shifting, and without any floating-point arithmetic. In I-ViT, linear operations (e.g., MatMul and Dense) follow the integer-only pipeline with dyadic arithmetic, and non-linear operations (e.g., Softmax, GELU, and LayerNorm) are approximated by the proposed light-weight integer-only arithmetic methods. More specifically, I-ViT applies the proposed Shiftmax and ShiftGELU, which are designed to use integer bit-shifting to approximate the corresponding floating-point operations. We evaluate I-ViT on various benchmark models and the results show that integer-only INT8 quantization achieves comparable (or even slightly higher) accuracy to the full-precision (FP) baseline. Furthermore, we utilize TVM for practical hardware deployment on the GPU's integer arithmetic units, achieving 3.72$\\sim$4.11$\\times$ inference speedup compared to the FP model. Code of both Pytorch and TVM is released at https://github.com/zkkli/I-ViT.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates gating mechanisms and graph-inspired convolutional operations, several key points and relevant sources need to be highlighted:\n\n### Goal and Intent\nThe researcher aims to enhance the TTTLinear Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by incorporating gating mechanisms and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to improve the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies.
