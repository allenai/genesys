The pitfalls of next-token prediction (Avg.

We crystallize this emerging concern and correct popular misconceptions surrounding it, and advocate a simple multi-token objective. As a starting point, we argue that the two often-conflated phases of next-token prediction -- autoregressive inference and teacher-forced training -- must be treated distinctly. The popular criticism that errors can compound during autoregressive inference, crucially assumes that teacher-forcing has learned an accurate next-token predictor. This assumption sidesteps a more deep-rooted problem we expose: in certain classes of tasks, teacher-forcing can simply fail to learn an accurate next-token predictor in the first place. We describe a general mechanism of how teacher-forcing can fail, and design a minimal planning task where both the Transformer and the Mamba architecture empirically fail in that manner -- remarkably, despite the task being straightforward to learn. Finally, we provide preliminary evidence that this failure can be resolved using a simple modification that predicts multiple tokens in advance. We hope this finding can ground future debates and inspire explorations beyond the next-token prediction paradigm. We make our code available under https://github.com/gregorbachmann/Next-Token-Failures\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/57 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing. Our code is public.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/47 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Int.

As a result, recent advances in natural language processing have been made utilising recursive neural networks using memory models that allow them to infer tree-type representations of the input sentence sequence. These new tree models have allowed for improvements in sentiment analysis and semantic recognition. Here we review the Ordered Memory model proposed by Shen et al. (2019) at the NeurIPS 2019 conference, and try to either create baselines that can perform better or create simpler models that can perform equally as well. We found that the Ordered Memory model performs on par with the state-of-the-art models used in tree-type modelling, and performs better than simplified baselines that require fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/24 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of The Fourteenth Annual Conference of Cognitive Science Society.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/54 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nJ.

Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Deciding How to Decide: Dynamic Routing in Artificial Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Mason McGill, P. Perona*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that, in dynamically-routed networks trained to classify images, layers and branches become specialized to process distinct categories of images.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose and systematically evaluate three strategies for training dynamically-routed artificial neural networks: graphs of learned transformations through which different input signals may take different paths. Though some approaches have advantages over others, the resulting networks are often qualitatively similar. We find that, in dynamically-routed networks trained to classify images, layers and branches become specialized to process distinct categories of images. Additionally, given a fixed computational budget, dynamically-routed networks tend to perform better than comparable statically-routed networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 99  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. PRES: Toward Scalable Memory-Based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Chuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned Finite State Machines\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Siyuan Chen, Pratik Fegade, Tianqi Chen, Phillip B. Gibbons, T. Mowry*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning and finds that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads.\n\n**Abstract:** Batching has a fundamental influence on the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) execution. However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. Further, batching puts strict restrictions on memory adjacency and can lead to high data movement costs. In this paper, we provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads, which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x, 1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU and GPU.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Sequential Routing Framework: Fully Capsule Network-based Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks dynamic routing memory*\n\n*Hong-Gee Kim, Kyungmin Lee, Chang Woo Han, Sungsoo Kim, Kwangyoun Kim, Hyunwhan Joe, Hyeontaek Lim*\n\n**Abstract:** Capsule networks (CapsNets) have recently gotten attention as a novel neural architecture. This paper presents the sequential routing framework which we believe is the first method to adapt a CapsNet-only structure to sequence-to-sequence recognition. Input sequences are capsulized then sliced by a window size. Each slice is classified to a label at the corresponding time through iterative routing mechanisms. Afterwards, losses are computed by connectionist temporal classification (CTC). During routing, the required number of parameters can be controlled by the window size regardless of the length of sequences by sharing learnable weights across the slices. We additionally propose a sequential dynamic routing algorithm to replace traditional dynamic routing. The proposed technique can minimize decoding speed degradation caused by the routing iterations since it can operate in a non-iterative manner without dropping accuracy. The method achieves a 1.1% lower word error rate at 16.9% on the Wall Street Journal corpus compared to bidirectional long short-term memory-based CTC networks. On the TIMIT corpus, it attains a 0.7% lower phone error rate at 17.5% compared to convolutional neural network-based CTC networks (Zhang et al., 2016).\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive computation mechanisms, dynamic routing, and efficient memory management, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Dynamic Routing and Adaptive Computation\n\nThe paper on \"Duo-LLM: A Framework for Studying Adaptive Computation in Large Language Models\" is highly relevant here. It introduces a novel framework that integrates smaller auxiliary modules within each Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layer of the LLM, enabling dynamic token routing based on task complexity.\n\n- **Dynamic Token Routing**: The Duo-LLM framework allows tokens to be processed by either small or big modules at each layer, or even bypass certain layers entirely, based on the token's complexity.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03961, 2021.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

Human-like Episodic Memory for Infinite Context LLMs (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Z. Fountas, Martin A Benfeghoul, Adnan Oomerjee, Fenia Christopoulou, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** EM-LLM is introduced, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency and providing a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, but still struggle with processing extensive contexts, limiting their ability to maintain coherence and accuracy over long sequences. In contrast, the human brain excels at organising and retrieving episodic experiences across vast temporal scales, spanning a lifetime. In this work, we introduce EM-LLM, a novel approach that integrates key aspects of human episodic memory and event cognition into LLMs, enabling them to effectively handle practically infinite context lengths while maintaining computational efficiency. EM-LLM organises sequences of tokens into coherent episodic events using a combination of Bayesian surprise and graph-theoretic boundary refinement in an on-line fashion. When needed, these events are retrieved through a two-stage memory process, combining similarity-based and temporally contiguous retrieval for efficient and human-like access to relevant information. Experiments on the LongBench dataset demonstrate EM-LLM's superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art InfLLM model with an overall relative improvement of 4.3% across various tasks, including a 33% improvement on the PassageRetrieval task. Furthermore, our analysis reveals strong correlations between EM-LLM's event segmentation and human-perceived events, suggesting a bridge between this artificial system and its biological counterpart. This work not only advances LLM capabilities in processing extended contexts but also provides a computational framework for exploring human memory mechanisms, opening new avenues for interdisciplinary research in AI and cognitive science.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/36 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2024.

EXACT: Scalable Graph Neural Networks Training via Extreme Activation Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid memory hierarchies neural networks compression*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Fan Yang, Li Li, Rui Chen, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch, and a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called EXACT, which for the first time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs is a fundamental challenge due to the high memory usage, which is mainly occupied by activations (e.g., node embeddings). Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of nodes retained in memory. In parallel, unlike what has been developed for other types of neural networks, training with compressed activation maps is less explored for GNNs. This extension is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to implement due to the lack of necessary tools in common graph learning packages. To un-leash the potential of this direction, we provide an optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations. Based on the implementation, we propose a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called \u201cEXACT\u201d, which for the \ufb01rst time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations. We systematically analyze the trade-off among the memory saving, time overhead, and accuracy drop. In practice, EXACT can reduce the memory footprint of activations by up to 32 \u00d7 with 0 . 2 - 0 . 5% accuracy drop and 10 - 25% time overhead across different models and datasets. We implement EXACT as an extension for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch. In practice, for Pytorch Geometric, EXACT can trim down the hardware requirement of training a three-layer full-batch GraphSAGE on ogbn-products from a 48GB GPU to a 12GB GPU.

A Graph is Worth 1-bit Spikes: When Graph Contrastive Learning Meets Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid memory hierarchies neural networks compression*\n\n*Jintang Li, Huizhe Zhang, Ruofan Wu, Zulun Zhu, Liang Chen, Zibin Zheng, Baokun Wang, Changhua Meng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes SpikeGCL, a novel GCL framework to learn binarized 1-bit representations for graphs, making balanced trade-offs between efficiency and performance, and provides theoretical guarantees to demonstrate that SpikeGCL has comparable expressiveness with its full-precision counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** While contrastive self-supervised learning has become the de-facto learning paradigm for graph neural networks, the pursuit of higher task accuracy requires a larger hidden dimensionality to learn informative and discriminative full-precision representations, raising concerns about computation, memory footprint, and energy consumption burden (largely overlooked) for real-world applications. This work explores a promising direction for graph contrastive learning (GCL) with spiking neural networks (SNNs), which leverage sparse and binary characteristics to learn more biologically plausible and compact representations. We propose SpikeGCL, a novel GCL framework to learn binarized 1-bit representations for graphs, making balanced trade-offs between efficiency and performance. We provide theoretical guarantees to demonstrate that SpikeGCL has comparable expressiveness with its full-precision counterparts. Experimental results demonstrate that, with nearly 32x representation storage compression, SpikeGCL is either comparable to or outperforms many fancy state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised methods across several graph benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid memory hierarchies neural networks compression*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Network Memory Footprint Compression Through Jointly Learnable Codebooks and Mappings\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid memory hierarchies neural networks compression*\n\n*Edouard Yvinec, Arnaud Dapogny, K\u00e9vin Bailly*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Abstract:** The massive interest in deep neural networks (DNNs) for both computer vision and natural language processing has been sparked by the growth in computational power. However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point where it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as mobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution as it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format. In terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based on codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they either define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive mapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the mapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal search. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we initially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered structure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or map weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping overhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint learning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with recent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing estimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel gradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and their mappings. The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Neural Networks and the Chomsky Hierarchy\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid memory hierarchies neural networks compression*\n\n*Gr'egoire Del'etang, Anian Ruoss, Jordi Grau-Moya, Tim Genewein, L. Wenliang, Elliot Catt, Marcus Hutter, S. Legg, Pedro A. Ortega*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs, including negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Reliable generalization lies at the heart of safe ML and AI. However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 98  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hybrid memory hierarchies, compression techniques, and efficient state management, here are some key papers and concepts that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n### Hybrid Memory Architectures\n\n1. **Hierarchical Memory Networks**:\n   - The concept of hierarchical memory networks can be explored in the context of neural networks.

This can be a foundation for designing hybrid memory architectures.\n\n### Memory Compression Methods\n\n1. **Quantization and Pruning**:\n   - Techniques such as quantization and pruning can significantly reduce the memory footprint of neural networks. For instance, the paper \"Quantizing Deep Convolutional Networks for Efficient Inference: A Whitepaper\" by Krishnamoorthi (2018) discusses methods to quantize neural networks, which can be applied to autoregressive models to reduce memory usage.\n\n2. **Compressed Memory Representations**:\n   - Research on compressed memory representations, such as the work by Chen et al. in \"Compressed Memory-Augmented Neural Networks\" (2020), explores how to compress memory states efficiently without compromising performance.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2023), which may be easier to reason about. Computation. After the parameters have been transformed from $(\\Delta, A, B, C) \\mapsto(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)$, the model can be computed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3). Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one timestep at a time). Linear Time Invariance (LTI). An important property of equations (1) to (3) is that the model's dynamics are constant through time. In other words $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, and consequently $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ as well, are fixed for all time-steps. This property is\ncalled linear time invariance ( $L T I$ ), which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions. Informally, we think of LTI SSMs as being equivalent to any linear recurrence (2a) or convolution (3b), and use LTI as an umbrella term for these classes of models. Thus far, all structured SSMs have been LTI (e.g. computed as convolutions) because of fundamental efficiency constraints, discussed in Section 3.3. However, a core insight of this work is that LTI models have fundamental limitations in modeling certain types of data, and our technical contributions involve removing the LTI constraint while overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks. Structure and Dimensions. Finally, we note that structured SSMs are so named because computing them efficiently also requires imposing structure on the $A$ matrix. The most popular form of structure is diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which we also use. In this case, the $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}, \\boldsymbol{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ matrices can all be represented by $N$ numbers. To operate over an input sequence $x$ of batch size $B$ and length $L$ with $D$ channels, the SSM is applied independently to each channel. Note that in this case, the total hidden state has dimension $D N$ per input, and computing it over the sequence length requires $O(B L D N)$ time and memory; this is the root of the fundamental efficiency bottleneck addressed in Section 3.3. General State Space Models. We note that the term state space model has a very broad meaning which simply represents the notion of any recurrent process with a latent state. It has been used to refer to many disparate concepts in different disciplines, including Markov decision processes (MDP) (reinforcement learning (Hafner et al. 2020)), dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (computational neuroscience (Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003)), Kalman filters (controls (Kalman 1960)), hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear dynamical systems (LDS) (machine learning), and recurrent (and sometimes convolutional) models at large (deep learning). Throughout this entire paper we use the term \"SSM\" to refer exclusively to the class of structured SSMs or S4 models (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state space models compression adaptive computation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models compression adaptive computation*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models compression adaptive computation*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Elucidating the Design Space of Dataset Condensation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models compression adaptive computation*\n\n*Zhiqiang Shen, Huanran Chen, Zikai Zhou, Shitong Shao*\n\n**Abstract:** Dataset condensation, a concept within data-centric learning, efficiently transfers critical attributes from an original dataset to a synthetic version, maintaining both diversity and realism. This approach significantly improves model training efficiency and is adaptable across multiple application areas. Previous methods in dataset condensation have faced challenges: some incur high computational costs which limit scalability to larger datasets (e.g., MTT, DREAM, and TESLA), while others are restricted to less optimal design spaces, which could hinder potential improvements, especially in smaller datasets (e.g., SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED). To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive design framework that includes specific, effective strategies like implementing soft category-aware matching and adjusting the learning rate schedule. These strategies are grounded in empirical evidence and theoretical backing. Our resulting approach, Elucidate Dataset Condensation (EDC), establishes a benchmark for both small and large-scale dataset condensation. In our testing, EDC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reaching 48.6% on ImageNet-1k with a ResNet-18 model at an IPC of 10, which corresponds to a compression ratio of 0.78%. This performance exceeds those of SRe2L, G-VBSM, and RDED by margins of 27.3%, 17.2%, and 6.6%, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. LoG-VMamba: Local-Global Vision Mamba for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models compression adaptive computation*\n\n*Aleksei Tiulpin, Huy Hoang Nguyen, Trung Dinh Quoc Dang*\n\n**Abstract:** Mamba, a State Space Model (SSM), has recently shown competitive performance to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers in Natural Language Processing and general sequence modeling. Various attempts have been made to adapt Mamba to Computer Vision tasks, including medical image segmentation (MIS). Vision Mamba (VM)-based networks are particularly attractive due to their ability to achieve global receptive fields, similar to Vision Transformers, while also maintaining linear complexity in the number of tokens. However, the existing VM models still struggle to maintain both spatially local and global dependencies of tokens in high dimensional arrays due to their sequential nature. Employing multiple and/or complicated scanning strategies is computationally costly, which hinders applications of SSMs to high-dimensional 2D and 3D images that are common in MIS problems. In this work, we propose Local-Global Vision Mamba, LoG-VMamba, that explicitly enforces spatially adjacent tokens to remain nearby on the channel axis, and retains the global context in a compressed form. Our method allows the SSMs to access the local and global contexts even before reaching the last token while requiring only a simple scanning strategy. Our segmentation models are computationally efficient and substantially outperform both CNN and Transformers-based baselines on a diverse set of 2D and 3D MIS tasks. The implementation of LoG-VMamba is available at \\url{https://github.com/Oulu-IMEDS/LoG-VMamba}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design with a focus on efficient state space models, compression techniques, adaptive computation, and memory-efficient state update mechanisms, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Compression Techniques for State Representations\n- **Quantization and Pruning**: The work by Song Han highlights the use of quantization and pruning techniques to compress neural networks efficiently. Techniques like SmoothQuant, AWQ, and StreamingLLM have been developed to improve the efficiency of large language model inference, which can be applied to state space models to reduce memory footprint and computational overhead.\n- **Hierarchical Compression**: The concept of hierarchical compression, as mentioned in the analysis, can be applied to state space models. This involves using different compression strategies for different types of information, such as using codebook approaches to map weights to several codebooks without mapping overhead.\n\n## Adaptive Computation in SSMs\n- **Adaptive History Modeling**: The paper on Continuous Video Understanding (C-VUE) introduces an adaptive history modeling approach that can be adapted for state space models. This method uses a pre-trained encoder to extract spatial features and then projects these features using a linear layer to reduce spatial redundancy based on temporal relationships. This adaptive approach can be applied to SSMs to dynamically adjust the state update process based on input characteristics.\n- **Dynamic Compression**: Dynamic compression based on input characteristics can be integrated into SSMs. This involves adjusting the compression ratio and computational overhead based on the complexity of the input, which can be achieved through techniques like those described in the \"Network Memory Footprint Compression\" paper.\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Update Mechanisms\n- **Hierarchical Attention and Chunking**: The concept of hierarchical attention and chunking strategies can be applied to SSMs. For example, the \"Hierarchical Memory for Reinforcement Learning\" paper describes a method where memories are stored in chunks, and attention is performed over coarse summaries of these chunks before detailed attention within relevant chunks. This approach can reduce memory bandwidth and improve efficiency in state updates.\n- **State Assistance Design**: The state-assistance design mentioned in the C-VUE paper, which uses hidden states to enhance efficiency by reducing complexity, can be optimized for SSMs. This involves maintaining a group of hidden states and using gating mechanisms to dynamically adjust the state update process, similar to LSTM designs.\n\n## Optimization Strategies for SSM Implementations\n- **Parallel Training and Inference**: The C-VUE paper discusses efficient parallel training and inference methods by unfolding the recurrent state transition process into a convolutional form. This approach can be applied to SSMs to improve training and inference efficiency.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: The work by Song Han on hardware-aware neural architecture search and efficient inference engines can be leveraged to optimize SSM implementations for resource-constrained hardware. Techniques like weight sparsity and efficient accelerators can significantly improve the efficiency of SSMs.\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing, as described in the Nature article, can provide efficient hardware acceleration for transformer networks and potentially for SSMs. This approach can reduce latency and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and adaptive state space models for autoregressive language models, focusing on compression, adaptive computation, and memory-efficient state updates.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/74 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n2023), which may be easier to reason about. Computation. After the parameters have been transformed from $(\\Delta, A, B, C) \\mapsto(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)$, the model can be computed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3). Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one timestep at a time). Linear Time Invariance (LTI). An important property of equations (1) to (3) is that the model's dynamics are constant through time. In other words $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, and consequently $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ as well, are fixed for all time-steps. This property is\ncalled linear time invariance ( $L T I$ ), which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions. Informally, we think of LTI SSMs as being equivalent to any linear recurrence (2a) or convolution (3b), and use LTI as an umbrella term for these classes of models. Thus far, all structured SSMs have been LTI (e.g. computed as convolutions) because of fundamental efficiency constraints, discussed in Section 3.3. However, a core insight of this work is that LTI models have fundamental limitations in modeling certain types of data, and our technical contributions involve removing the LTI constraint while overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks. Structure and Dimensions. Finally, we note that structured SSMs are so named because computing them efficiently also requires imposing structure on the $A$ matrix. The most popular form of structure is diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which we also use. In this case, the $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}, \\boldsymbol{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ matrices can all be represented by $N$ numbers. To operate over an input sequence $x$ of batch size $B$ and length $L$ with $D$ channels, the SSM is applied independently to each channel. Note that in this case, the total hidden state has dimension $D N$ per input, and computing it over the sequence length requires $O(B L D N)$ time and memory; this is the root of the fundamental efficiency bottleneck addressed in Section 3.3. General State Space Models. We note that the term state space model has a very broad meaning which simply represents the notion of any recurrent process with a latent state. It has been used to refer to many disparate concepts in different disciplines, including Markov decision processes (MDP) (reinforcement learning (Hafner et al. 2020)), dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (computational neuroscience (Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003)), Kalman filters (controls (Kalman 1960)), hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear dynamical systems (LDS) (machine learning), and recurrent (and sometimes convolutional) models at large (deep learning). Throughout this entire paper we use the term \"SSM\" to refer exclusively to the class of structured SSMs or S4 models (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 4 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: gradient computation SSM adaptive state size memory mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation SSM adaptive state size memory mechanisms*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Aiming at a fast, robust, and widely-applicable NAS, we develop a generic optimization framework for NAS. We turn a coupled optimization of connection weights and neural architecture into a differentiable optimization by means of stochastic relaxation. It accepts arbitrary search space (widely-applicable) and enables to employ a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of weights and architecture (fast). We propose a stochastic natural gradient method with an adaptive step-size mechanism built upon our theoretical investigation (robust).

Glance-and-Gaze Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation SSM adaptive state size memory mechanisms*\n\n*Qihang Yu, Yingda Xia, Yutong Bai, Yongyi Lu, A. Yuille, Wei Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer (GG-Transformer), motivated by the Glance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural scenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and local context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, there emerges a series of vision Transformers, which show superior performance with a more compact model size than conventional convolutional neural networks, thanks to the strong ability of Transformers to model long-range dependencies. However, the advantages of vision Transformers also come with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a quadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic increase of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length, thus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks that require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps. In this paper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer (GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the Glance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural scenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and local context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by two parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing self-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads to a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze branch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which compensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance mechanism. We empirically demonstrate our method achieves consistently superior performance over previous state-of-the-art Transformers on various vision tasks and benchmarks.

This method significantly speeds up the training process and reduces the number of parameters, making it more efficient for long sequence modeling.\n\n## Techniques for Adaptive State Size Selection\n\n- The concept of adaptive state size selection can be inferred from the use of model-order reduction techniques. For example, the \"Efficient State Space Model\" paper discusses the use of block diagonalization, which allows for the reduction of model parameters and the selection of an optimal state size based on the complexity of the task. This approach enables the model to adapt its state size dynamically to balance between model capacity and computational efficiency.\n\n- Additionally, the \"Mamba\" framework, mentioned in the context of state-space models, employs a data-dependent selection technique that filters specific inputs and captures long-term context as the sequence length increases. This can be seen as a form of adaptive state size selection, where the model adjusts its state representation based on the input data.\n\n## Integration of Different Memory Mechanisms in SSMs\n\n- State-space models can integrate various memory mechanisms to enhance their representation power. For instance, the integration of local and global context is discussed in the context of \"Vision Mamba,\" where bidirectional state space models are used to represent visual data. This approach combines the benefits of local and global memory mechanisms to capture both fine-grained and long-range dependencies.\n\n- The \"DenseMamba\" model also integrates different memory mechanisms by selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, which helps in preserving fine-grained information crucial for the final output. This dense connection strategy enhances the model's ability to capture a wide range of contextual information.\n\n## Methods for Balancing Model Capacity with Computational Efficiency\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model\" paper provides several strategies to balance model capacity with computational efficiency. These include:\n  - **Diagonalization and Block Diagonalization**: These techniques reduce the number of model parameters and improve the model's flexibility without adding complexity.\n  - **Fast Tensor Convolution**: This method, based on FFT, reduces the computational cost associated with tensor convolution.\n  - **Bidirectional Kernels**: These enhance the model's diversity and efficiency, allowing for efficient processing of sequential data.\n\n- The use of **quantization methods** for SSMs, as mentioned in the context of deploying SSMs on resource-constrained hardware, is another approach to balance model capacity with computational efficiency. These methods ensure that the models can be effectively utilized without compromising performance.\n\nThese techniques and approaches can help researchers in designing more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models using state space models, addressing the key areas of efficient gradient computation, adaptive state size selection, integration of different memory mechanisms, and balancing model capacity with computational efficiency.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/54 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2019.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

MEC: Memory-efficient Convolution for Deep Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: parallel FFT neural networks*\n\n*Minsik Cho, D. Brand*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process and reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution is a critical component in modern deep neural networks, thus several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is simple but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect methods have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based convolution, or Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods have high memory-overhead, which creates performance degradation and offers a poor trade-off between performance and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process. MEC lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact way (i.e., much less memory-overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications in parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory footprint improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our experimental results show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms, compared with other indirect convolution algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 80  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2.

Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the imaginary-removing bootstrapping to prevent the deep neural networks from catastrophic divergence during approximate ReLU operations and successfully implements ResNet-110 with high accuracy on the RNS-CKKS scheme for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the standard ResNet-20 network was successfully implemented on the fully homomorphic encryption scheme, residue number system variant Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (RNS-CKKS) scheme using bootstrapping, but the implementation lacks practicality due to high latency and low security level. To improve the performance, we first minimize total bootstrapping runtime using multiplexed parallel convolution that collects sparse output data for multiple channels com-pactly. We also propose the imaginary-removing bootstrapping to prevent the deep neural networks from catastrophic divergence during approximate ReLU operations. In addition, we optimize level consumptions and use lighter and tighter parameters. Simulation results show that we have 4.67 \u00d7 lower inference latency and 134 \u00d7 less amortized runtime (runtime per image) for ResNet-20 compared to the state-of-the-art previous work, and we achieve standard 128-bit security. Furthermore, we successfully implement ResNet-110 with high accuracy on the RNS-CKKS scheme for the first time.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3.

Several recent studies, on tasks ranging from group arithmetic to in-context linear regression, have suggested that the answer is yes. Using modular addition as a prototypical problem, we show that algorithm discovery in neural networks is sometimes more complex. Small changes to model hyperparameters and initializations can induce the discovery of qualitatively different algorithms from a fixed training set, and even parallel implementations of multiple such algorithms. Some networks trained to perform modular addition implement a familiar Clock algorithm; others implement a previously undescribed, less intuitive, but comprehensible procedure which we term the Pizza algorithm, or a variety of even more complex procedures. Our results show that even simple learning problems can admit a surprising diversity of solutions, motivating the development of new tools for characterizing the behavior of neural networks across their algorithmic phase space.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory management deep learning*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

Dynamic Sparse Graph for Efficient Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory management deep learning*\n\n*L. Liu, Lei Deng, Xing Hu, Maohua Zhu, Guoqi Li, Yufei Ding, Yuan Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) with dynamic and sparse graph (DSG) structure for compressive memory and accelerative execution during both training and inference. The great success of DNNs motivates the pursuing of lightweight models for the deployment onto embedded devices. However, most of the previous studies optimize for inference while neglect training or even complicate it. Training is far more intractable, since (i) the neurons dominate the memory cost rather than the weights in inference; (ii) the dynamic activation makes previous sparse acceleration via one-off optimization on fixed weight invalid; (iii) batch normalization (BN) is critical for maintaining accuracy while its activation reorganization damages the sparsity. To address these issues, DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS). Experiments show significant memory saving (1.7-4.5x) and operation reduction (2.3-4.4x) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6.

Mocanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work draws a unique connection between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets, which surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria: prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The success of deep ensembles on improving predictive performance, uncertainty estimation, and out-of-distribution robustness has been extensively studied in the machine learning literature. Albeit the promising results, naively training multiple deep neural networks and combining their predictions at inference leads to prohibitive computational costs and memory requirements. Recently proposed efficient ensemble approaches reach the performance of the traditional deep ensembles with significantly lower costs. However, the training resources required by these approaches are still at least the same as training a single dense model. In this work, we draw a unique connection between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets. Instead of training multiple dense networks and averaging them, we directly train sparse subnetworks from scratch and extract diverse yet accurate subnetworks during this efficient, sparse-to-sparse training. Our framework, FreeTickets, is defined as the ensemble of these relatively cheap sparse subnetworks. Despite being an ensemble method, FreeTickets has even fewer parameters and training FLOPs than a single dense model. This seemingly counter-intuitive outcome is due to the ultra training/inference efficiency of dynamic sparse training. FreeTickets surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria: prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD) robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference. Impressively, FreeTickets outperforms the naive deep ensemble with ResNet50 on ImageNet using around only 1/5 of the training FLOPs required by the latter.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

Spectral Clustering with Graph Neural Networks for Graph Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization spectral operations*\n\n*F. Bianchi, Daniele Grattarola, C.

SC can be used in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to implement pooling operations that aggregate nodes belonging to the same cluster. However, the eigendecomposition of the Laplacian is expensive and, since clustering results are graph-specific, pooling methods based on SC must perform a new optimization for each new sample. In this paper, we propose a graph clustering approach that addresses these limitations of SC. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the normalized minCUT problem and train a GNN to compute cluster assignments that minimize this objective. Our GNN-based implementation is differentiable, does not require to compute the spectral decomposition, and learns a clustering function that can be quickly evaluated on out-of-sample graphs. From the proposed clustering method, we design a graph pooling operator that overcomes some important limitations of state-of-the-art graph pooling techniques and achieves the best performance in several supervised and unsupervised tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 370  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Searching for Winograd-aware Quantized Networks\n\n*From Search Query: parallel FFT neural networks*\n\n*Paul N. Whatmough, Javier Fernandez-Marques, Matthew Mattina, Andrew Mundy*\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight architectural designs of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) together with quantization have paved the way for the deployment of demanding computer vision applications on mobile devices. Parallel to this, alternative formulations to the convolution operation such as FFT, Strassen and Winograd, have been adapted for use in CNNs offering further speedups. Winograd convolutions are the fastest known algorithm for spatially small convolutions, but exploiting their full potential comes with the burden of numerical error, rendering them unusable in quantized contexts. In this work we propose a Winograd-aware formulation of convolution layers which exposes the numerical inaccuracies introduced by the Winograd transformations to the learning of the model parameters, enabling the design of competitive quantized models without impacting model size. We also address the source of the numerical error and propose a relaxation on the form of the transformation matrices, resulting in up to 10% higher classification accuracy on CIFAR-10. Finally, we propose wiNAS, a neural architecture search (NAS) framework that jointly optimizes a given macro-architecture for accuracy and latency leveraging Winograd-aware layers. A Winograd-aware ResNet-18 optimized with wiNAS for CIFAR-10 results in 2.66x speedup compared to im2row, one of the most widely used optimized convolution implementations, with no loss in accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. A differentiable brain simulator bridging brain simulation and brain-inspired computing\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory management deep learning*\n\n*Shangyang Li, Hongyaoxing Gu, Si Wu, Sichao He, Tianqiu Zhang, ChaoMing Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Brain simulation builds dynamical models to mimic the structure and functions of the brain, while brain-inspired computing (BIC) develops intelligent systems by learning from the structure and functions of the brain. The two fields are intertwined and should share a common programming framework to facilitate each other's development. However, none of the existing software in the fields can achieve this goal, because traditional brain simulators lack differentiability for training, while existing deep learning (DL) frameworks fail to capture the biophysical realism and complexity of brain dynamics. In this paper, we introduce BrainPy, a differentiable brain simulator developed using JAX and XLA, with the aim of bridging the gap between brain simulation and BIC. BrainPy expands upon the functionalities of JAX, a powerful AI framework, by introducing complete capabilities for flexible, efficient, and scalable brain simulation. It offers a range of sparse and event-driven operators for efficient and scalable brain simulation, an abstraction for managing the intricacies of synaptic computations, a modular and flexible interface for constructing multi-scale brain models, and an object-oriented just-in-time compilation approach to handle the memory-intensive nature of brain dynamics. We showcase the efficiency and scalability of BrainPy on benchmark tasks, highlight its differentiable simulation for biologically plausible spiking models, and discuss its potential to support research at the intersection of brain simulation and BIC.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Frequency-aware Software Cache for Large Recommendation System Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic memory management deep learning*\n\n*Yang You, Jin Liu, Yongbin Li, Zhengda Bian, Shenggui Li, Jiatong Han, Geng Zhang, Jiarui Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) have been widely applied in Internet companies. The embedding tables of DLRMs are too large to fit on GPU memory entirely. We propose a GPU-based software cache approaches to dynamically manage the embedding table in the CPU and GPU memory space by leveraging the id's frequency statistics of the target dataset. Our proposed software cache is efficient in training entire DLRMs on GPU in a synchronized update manner. It is also scaled to multiple GPUs in combination with the widely used hybrid parallel training approaches. Evaluating our prototype system shows that we can keep only 1.5% of the embedding parameters in the GPU to obtain a decent end-to-end training speed.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-08\n\n\n\n#### 4. The Science Performance of the Gemini High Resolution Optical Spectrograph\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization spectral operations*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The Gemini High Resolution Optical Spectrograph (GHOST) is a fiber-fed spectrograph system on the Gemini South telescope that provides simultaneous wavelength coverage from 348 - 1061nm, and designed for optimal performance between 363 - 950nm. It can observe up to two objects simultaneously in a 7.5 arcmin diameter field of regard at R = 56,000 or a single object at R = 75,000. The spectral resolution modes are obtained by using integral field units to image slice a 1.2\" aperture by a factor of five in width using 19 fibers in the high resolution mode and by a factor of three in width using 7 fibers in the standard resolution mode. GHOST is equipped with hardware to allow for precision radial velocity measurements, expected to approach meters per second precision. Here, we describe the basic design and operational capabilities of GHOST, and proceed to derive and quantify the key aspects of its on-sky performance that are of most relevance to its science users.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on parallel FFT operations, dynamic memory management, hardware-specific optimizations for spectral operations, and other related aspects, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Parallel Processing Techniques for FFT Operations in Neural Networks\n\n- The paper on \"Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing\" discusses the implementation of FFTs in analog in-memory computing systems, which can be highly efficient and scalable.

The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory. ## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a core problem in sequence prediction/modelling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Hop82, RHW ${ }^{+}$85, Elm90] are a natural choice, but are notoriously hard to train; they often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients [BSF94, PMB13] and despite techniques to mitigate the issue [HS97, $\\mathrm{CVMG}^{+}$14, ASB16], they are also hard to scale given the inherently sequential nature of their computation. In recent years, transformer models $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17 have become the staple of sequence modelling, achieving remarkable success across multiple domains $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+}\\right.$20, $\\mathrm{DBK}^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{JEP}^{+}$21]. Transformer models are naturally parallelizable and hence scale significantly better than RNNs. However, attention layers have memory/computation requirements that scale quadratically with context length. Many approximations have been proposed (see [TDBM22] for a recent survey). RNNs have seen a recent resurgence in the form of state space models (SSM) which have shown promise in modelling long sequences across varied modalities GGR21, $\\mathrm{DFS}^{+}$22, GGB22, $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23$, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23, GD23]. SSMs use linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the sequence-to sequence transform by evolving the internal state of a dynamical system according to the dynamics equations\n\n$$\nx_{t}=A x_{t-1}+B u_{t} \\quad y_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the hidden state of the dynamical system, $u_{t}$ is the input to the system, and $y_{t}$ are observations. The matrices $A, B, C, D$ govern the evolution of the system and are called system matrices. Despite its simplicity, this linear model can capture a rich set of natural dynamical systems\nin engineering and the physical sciences due to the potentially large number of hidden dimensions. Linear dynamical systems are also attractive as a sequence model because their structure is amenable to both fast inference and fast training via parallel scans [Ble89, SWL23] or convolutions [GGR21]. A rich literature stemming from control theory and recent machine learning interest has given rise to efficient techniques for system identification, filtering, and prediction for linear dynamical systems. For a survey of recent literature see [HS22]. These techniques make SSMs attractive for sequence tasks which inherently depend on long contexts that scale poorly for transformers. Examples include large language models [DFS ${ }^{+}$22], modelling time series [ZSP ${ }^{+}$23], and audio generation [GGDR22]. To understand the factors affecting the memory in an SSM or simply a linear dynamical system, we now proceed to delineate how past states and inputs affect the future. Geometric decay in LDS. The linear equations governing the dynamics are recursive in nature, and imply that in a noiseless environment, the $t$ 'th output can be written as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}=C\\left(A x_{t-1}+B u_{t}\\right)+D u_{t}=\\ldots=\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nThe matrix $A$ is asymmetric in general, and can have complex eigenvalues. If the amplitude of these eigenvalues is $>1$, then the output $y_{t}$ can grow without bounds. This is called an \"explosive\" system. In a well-behaved system, the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitude $<1$. If the magnitudes are bounded away from 1 , say $\\left|\\lambda_{i}(A)\\right|<1-\\delta$, for some $\\delta>0$ (referred to as spectral gap), then we can write\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+\\omega_{k},\\left\\|\\omega_{k}\\right\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor $k=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This mathematical fact implies that the effective memory of the system is on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$. In general, the parameter $\\delta$ is unknown apriori and can get arbitrarily small as we approach systems with have long range dependencies leading to instability in training linear dynamical systems with a long context. This issue is specifically highlighted in the work of [ $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+}$23] who observe that on long range tasks learning an LDS directly does not succeed and requires interventions such as stable exponential parameterizations and specific normalization which have been repeatedly used either implicitly or explicitly in the SSM literature [GGR21]. Unfortunately these reparametrizations and normalizations come with no theoretical guarantees. In fact this limitation is generally known to be fundamental to the use of linear dynamical systems, and can only be circumvented via a significant increase in sample complexity $\\left[\\mathrm{GLS}^{+}\\right.$20] or via control over the input sequence [SMT ${ }^{+}$18]. Spectral filtering for linear dynamical systems. A notable deviation from the standard theory of linear dynamical systems that allows efficient learning in the presence of arbitrarily long memory is the technique of spectral filtering [HSZ17]. The idea is to project the sequence of inputs to a small subspace that is constructed using special structure of discrete LDS where successive powers of the system matrix appear in the impulse response function. The basic idea is to represent the output as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} M_{j}\\left(\\sum_{i} \\phi_{j}(i) \\cdot u_{t-i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{j}$ are spectral filters which are sequence-length sized vectors that given the target sequence length can be computed offline, and $M_{j}$ are matrices parameterizing the model. These spectral-filters are the eigenvectors of the matrix constructed as the average of outer products of the discrete impulseresponse functions, viz $Z=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]^{\\top} d \\alpha$. It is shown that this matrix is inherently low-dimensional and for all $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, vectors of the form $\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]$ are well approximated by the top-eigenspace of Z. Figure 1 depicts these filters. For the details of how these filters are derived and their computation, see Section 2\n\nWhy is spectral filtering important? The main advantage of spectral filtering is that for certain types of linear dynamical systems, in particular those with symmetric matrices $A$, the effective memory(measured by the number of filters) required to represent an observation at any point in the sequence in the spectral basis is independent of the spectral gap parameter $\\delta!$. This guarantee indicates that if we featurize the input into the spectral basis, we can potentially design models that\nare capable of efficiently and stably representing systems with extremely long memory even with $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. This striking fact motivates our derivation of the recurrent spectral architecture, and is the underlying justification for the performance and training stability gains we see in experiments. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_28085b3c06af8ebfb6a7g-03.jpg?height=524&width=816&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=641)\n\nFigure 1: Spectral Filters used by the Spectral Filtering Algorithm. The x-axis is the time domain. ### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nWe start by proposing state space models with learned components that apply spectral filtering for their featurization. We consider two types of spectral filters, which augment the original spectral filters proposed in HSZ17] with negative eigenvalues in two different ways. Our main contribution is a neural architecture that is based on these spectral state space models. This neural architecture can be applied recursively in layers, resulting in an expressive architecture for modeling sequential data. Finally we implement this neural architecture and apply it towards synthetically generated data as well as the Long Range Arena benchmark [TDA ${ }^{+21]}$. We demonstrate that spectral state space models can stably and more efficiently learn on sequence modelling tasks with long range dependencies without the need for exponential parameterizations, particular initializations and normalizations. Main Advantages of Spectral SSM. Previously proposed convolutional models for sequence modeling, surveyed in the related work section, learn the kernels from the data. The kernels used in Spectral SSM are theoretically-founded and fixed and thus parameter-free. In addition, our models are provably as expressive as an LDS. In particular, their expressiveness neither depends on the spectra gap nor on the dimension of the system, which are necessary in all other methods. ### 1.2 Related work\n\nDue to limited space, we provide a short overview of the most related work to us below and provide a detailed report on the related work in the appendix (Section A). State space models. SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years starting with the works [GDE $\\left.{ }^{+} 20\\right],\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ which propose and develop the HiPPO theory. [GGR21] develop the S4 parameterization to address the bottlenecks of training efficiency, performance and numberical stability. The $S 4$ parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization. The S 4 model was further streamlined in later works, viz. using diagonal system matrices without a loss in performance [GGB22] and the S5 model [SWL23] which uses a MIMO diagonal system and associative scans for computational efficiency. [OSG $\\left.{ }^{+} 23\\right]$ investigate whether simpler deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer under the crucial caveat that specific modifications on linear RNNs, namely the stable exponential parameterization, $\\gamma$ - normalization and ring initialization, are necessary to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2. There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems.

Towards Robust Pruning: An Adaptive Knowledge-Retention Pruning Strategy for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space models*\n\n*Jianwei Li, Qi Lei, Wei Cheng, Dongkuan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass, and introduces a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre- trained knowledge during the pruning process.\n\n**Abstract:** The pruning objective has recently extended beyond accuracy and sparsity to robustness in language models. Despite this, existing methods struggle to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks when continually increasing model sparsity and require a retraining process. As humans step into the era of large language models, these issues become increasingly prominent. This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass. Accordingly, we introduce a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre-trained knowledge during the pruning process. In this setup, each layer's reconstruction error not only originates from itself but also includes cumulative error from preceding layers, followed by an adaptive rectification. Compared to other state-of-art baselines, our approach demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy, sparsity, robustness, and pruning cost with BERT on datasets SST2, IMDB, and AGNews, marking a significant stride towards robust pruning in language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this work, we identify that metric scaling and metric task conditioning are important to improve the performance of few-shot algorithms. Our analysis reveals that simple metric scaling completely changes the nature of few-shot algorithm parameter updates. Metric scaling provides improvements up to 14% in accuracy for certain metrics on the mini-Imagenet 5-way 5-shot classification task. We further propose a simple and effective way of conditioning a learner on the task sample set, resulting in learning a task-dependent metric space. Moreover, we propose and empirically test a practical end-to-end optimization procedure based on auxiliary task co-training to learn a task-dependent metric space. The resulting few-shot learning model based on the task-dependent scaled metric achieves state of the art on mini-Imagenet. We confirm these results on another few-shot dataset that we introduce in this paper based on CIFAR100.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: spectral neural networks*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

How Powerful are Spectral Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: spectral neural networks*\n\n*Xiyuan Wang, Muhan Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that even spectral GNNs without nonlinearity can produce arbitrary graph signals and give two conditions for reaching universality, and JacobiConv is proposed, which uses Jacobi basis due to its orthogonality and flexibility to adapt to a wide range of weight functions.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral Graph Neural Network is a kind of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based on graph signal filters. Some models able to learn arbitrary spectral filters have emerged recently. However, few works analyze the expressive power of spectral GNNs. This paper studies spectral GNNs' expressive power theoretically. We first prove that even spectral GNNs without nonlinearity can produce arbitrary graph signals and give two conditions for reaching universality. They are: 1) no multiple eigenvalues of graph Laplacian, and 2) no missing frequency components in node features. We also establish a connection between the expressive power of spectral GNNs and Graph Isomorphism (GI) testing, the latter of which is often used to characterize spatial GNNs' expressive power. Moreover, we study the difference in empirical performance among different spectral GNNs with the same expressive power from an optimization perspective, and motivate the use of an orthogonal basis whose weight function corresponds to the graph signal density in the spectrum. Inspired by the analysis, we propose JacobiConv, which uses Jacobi basis due to its orthogonality and flexibility to adapt to a wide range of weight functions. JacobiConv deserts nonlinearity while outperforming all baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 29*)\n\n#### 6. Unsupervised Optical Flow Estimation with Dynamic Timing Representation for Spike Camera\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic dimension reduction*\n\n*Lujie Xia, Ziluo Ding, Rui Zhao, Jiyuan Zhang, Lei Ma, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang, Ruiqin Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** An unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data is proposed and can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently selecting an appropriate spike stream data length to extract precise information is the key to the spike vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\\%$ and $19\\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\\Delta t=10$ and $\\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Sparse Graph for Efficient Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic dimension reduction*\n\n*L. Liu, Lei Deng, Xing Hu, Maohua Zhu, Guoqi Li, Yufei Ding, Yuan Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) with dynamic and sparse graph (DSG) structure for compressive memory and accelerative execution during both training and inference. The great success of DNNs motivates the pursuing of lightweight models for the deployment onto embedded devices. However, most of the previous studies optimize for inference while neglect training or even complicate it. Training is far more intractable, since (i) the neurons dominate the memory cost rather than the weights in inference; (ii) the dynamic activation makes previous sparse acceleration via one-off optimization on fixed weight invalid; (iii) batch normalization (BN) is critical for maintaining accuracy while its activation reorganization damages the sparsity. To address these issues, DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS). Experiments show significant memory saving (1.7-4.5x) and operation reduction (2.3-4.4x) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba-FSCIL: Dynamic Adaptation with Selective State Space Model for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space models*\n\n*Min Zhang, Liqiang Nie, Bernard Ghanem, Jianlong Wu, Yibo Yang, Xiaojie Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) confronts the challenge of integrating new classes into a model with minimal training samples while preserving the knowledge of previously learned classes. Traditional methods widely adopt static adaptation relying on a fixed parameter space to learn from data that arrive sequentially, prone to overfitting to the current session. Existing dynamic strategies require the expansion of the parameter space continually, leading to increased complexity. In this study, we explore the potential of Selective State Space Models (SSMs) for FSCIL, leveraging its dynamic weights and strong ability in sequence modeling to address these challenges. Concretely, we propose a dual selective SSM projector that dynamically adjusts the projection parameters based on the intermediate features for dynamic adaptation. The dual design enables the model to maintain the robust features of base classes, while adaptively learning distinctive feature shifts for novel classes. Additionally, we develop a class-sensitive selective scan mechanism to guide dynamic adaptation. It minimizes the disruption to base-class representations caused by training on novel data, and meanwhile, forces the selective scan to perform in distinct patterns between base and novel classes. Experiments on miniImageNet, CUB-200, and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space models*\n\n*Nicholas Kr\u00e4mer*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Spectral Pruning for Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: spectral neural networks*\n\n*Tomohiro Daimon, Ryuji Saiin, Hiroyuki Kusumoto, Koichi Taniguchi, Kazuma Suetake, Takashi Furuya*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks used in sequential tasks. However, in general, RNNs have a large number of parameters and involve enormous computational costs by repeating the recurrent structures in many time steps. As a method to overcome this difficulty, RNN pruning has attracted increasing attention in recent years, and it brings us benefits in terms of the reduction of computational cost as the time step progresses. However, most existing methods of RNN pruning are heuristic. The purpose of this paper is to study the theoretical scheme for RNN pruning method. We propose an appropriate pruning algorithm for RNNs inspired by \"spectral pruning\", and provide the generalization error bounds for compressed RNNs. We also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical results and show the effectiveness of our pruning method compared with existing methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Dimension reduction of dynamical systems on networks with leading and non-leading eigenvectors of adjacency matrices\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic dimension reduction*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Dimension reduction techniques for dynamical systems on networks are considered to promote our understanding of the original high-dimensional dynamics. One strategy of dimension reduction is to derive a low-dimensional dynamical system whose behavior approximates the observables of the original dynamical system that are weighted linear summations of the state variables at the different nodes. Recently proposed methods use the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of the network as the mixture weights to obtain such observables. In the present study, we explore performances of this type of one-dimensional reductions of dynamical systems on networks when we use non-leading eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix as the mixture weights. Our theory predicts that non-leading eigenvectors can be more efficient than the leading eigenvector and enables us to select the eigenvector minimizing the error. We numerically verify that the optimal non-leading eigenvector outperforms the leading eigenvector for some dynamical systems and networks. We also argue that, despite our theory, it is practically better to use the leading eigenvector as the mixture weights to avoid misplacing the bifurcation point too distantly and to be resistant against dynamical noise.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the concepts of adaptive state space models, spectral methods, and efficient dimension reduction, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Adaptive State Dimensionality\n\n- The concept of adaptive state dimensionality is closely related to the idea of training a single model that can adapt to different computational constraints. The **MatMamba** architecture is a promising example, as it combines Matryoshka-style learning with state space models like Mamba2. MatMamba allows for the joint optimization of multiple nested models of varying sizes within the same weight space, enabling dynamic adjustment of state dimensions based on input complexity and available computational resources.\n\n## Spectral Methods in State Space Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of FFT-based operations in state space models, the idea of using spectral methods can be inferred from the broader context of efficient and adaptive modeling. For instance, the use of higher-order reversible methods in neural ODEs, as discussed in the context of learning dynamical systems, could be a precursor to exploring spectral methods for state updates. However, specific applications of FFT in state space models would require further research beyond the current sources.\n\n## Efficient Compression or Dimension Reduction\n\n- **MatMamba** offers a robust approach to dimension reduction through its nested Matryoshka structure. This allows for the extraction of hundreds of submodels from a single large model, each preserving the metric space of the original model. This method is particularly efficient for sequential models, as it enables adaptive inference based on available compute resources without the need for retraining.\n\n## Numerical Stability Analysis of Spectral Operations\n\n- The numerical stability of spectral operations is a critical aspect, but the provided sources do not directly address this in the context of state space models. However, the work on higher-order reversible methods in neural ODEs highlights the importance of numerical stability in gradient computations. Ensuring accurate gradient computations through reversible integrators could provide insights into maintaining numerical stability in spectral operations.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of State Space Models\n\n- The **MatMamba** architecture and the use of higher-order reversible methods in neural ODEs both address memory efficiency. MatMamba allows for the efficient deployment of models across various sizes without significant memory overhead, while the reversible methods ensure that memory requirements for backpropagation are independent of network depth.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Higher-Order Reversible Methods**: These methods, discussed in the context of neural ODEs, can be particularly useful for reducing the memory requirements and improving the computational efficiency of deep neural networks. The adaptivity in time-stepping and the higher-order accuracy can be beneficial for complex dynamical systems and potentially for autoregressive language models.\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: SSMs like Mamba2 and MatMamba offer faster theoretical training and inference times, especially for long context lengths, which is crucial for autoregressive language models. The adaptability and efficiency of these models make them promising candidates for improving the design of such models.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are adaptive, efficient, and scalable, with a focus on dynamic state dimensionality, spectral processing, and memory-efficient implementations.\n",

HiPPO: Recurrent Memory with Optimal Polynomial Projections (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, C.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/54 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths, our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the \u201cefficient Transformers\u201d on the Long Range Arena benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs).

Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling for Memory Efficient Adaptation of Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient spectral operations*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Guanchu Wang, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, D. Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

However, cache brings new memory-related costs and prevents leveraging larger batch size for faster speed. We propose memory-efficient lossless attention (called EL-attention) to address this issue. It avoids heavy operations for building multi-head keys and values, cache for them is not needed. EL-attention constructs an ensemble of attention results by expanding query while keeping key and value shared. It produces the same result as multi-head attention with less GPU memory and faster inference speed. We conduct extensive experiments on Transformer, BART, and GPT-2 for summarization and question generation tasks. The results show EL-attention speeds up existing models by 1.6x to 5.3x without accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Robust Pruning: An Adaptive Knowledge-Retention Pruning Strategy for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space language models*\n\n*Jianwei Li, Qi Lei, Wei Cheng, Dongkuan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass, and introduces a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre- trained knowledge during the pruning process.\n\n**Abstract:** The pruning objective has recently extended beyond accuracy and sparsity to robustness in language models. Despite this, existing methods struggle to enhance robustness against adversarial attacks when continually increasing model sparsity and require a retraining process. As humans step into the era of large language models, these issues become increasingly prominent. This paper proposes that the robustness of language models is proportional to the extent of pre-trained knowledge they encompass. Accordingly, we introduce a post-training pruning strategy designed to faithfully replicate the embedding space and feature space of dense language models, aiming to conserve more pre-trained knowledge during the pruning process. In this setup, each layer's reconstruction error not only originates from itself but also includes cumulative error from preceding layers, followed by an adaptive rectification. Compared to other state-of-art baselines, our approach demonstrates a superior balance between accuracy, sparsity, robustness, and pruning cost with BERT on datasets SST2, IMDB, and AGNews, marking a significant stride towards robust pruning in language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Scalable Language Model with Generalized Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space language models*\n\n*Bohao Peng, Zhuotao Tian, Shu Liu, Mingchang Yang, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes the Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe), integrated with Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR), to enable adaptive adjustment of language models based on specific downstream tasks, aiming to achieve a smooth and effortless continual learning process.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning has gained increasing importance as it facilitates the acquisition and refinement of scalable knowledge and skills in language models. However, existing methods typically encounter strict limitations and challenges in real-world scenarios, such as reliance on experience replay, optimization constraints, and inference task-ID. In this study, we introduce the Scalable Language Model (SLM) to overcome these limitations within a more challenging and generalized setting, representing a significant advancement toward practical applications for continual learning. Specifically, we propose the Joint Adaptive Re-Parameterization (JARe), integrated with Dynamic Task-related Knowledge Retrieval (DTKR), to enable adaptive adjustment of language models based on specific downstream tasks. This approach leverages the task distribution within the vector space, aiming to achieve a smooth and effortless continual learning process. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on diverse backbones and benchmarks, achieving effective continual learning in both full-set and few-shot scenarios with minimal forgetting. Moreover, while prior research primarily focused on a single task type such as classification, our study goes beyond, with the large language model, i.e., LLaMA-2, to explore the effects across diverse domains and task types, such that a single language model can be decently scaled to broader applications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space language models*\n\n*Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Shuang Li, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE is proposed, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learn.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

However, the storage and computational requirements have largely restricted their further extensions on mobile devices. Recently, pruning of unimportant parameters has been used for both network compression and acceleration. Considering that there are spatial redundancy within most filters in a CNN, we propose a frequency-domain dynamic pruning scheme to exploit the spatial correlations. The frequency-domain coefficients are pruned dynamically in each iteration and different frequency bands are pruned discriminatively, given their different importance on accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can outperform previous spatial-domain counterparts by a large margin. Specifically, it can achieve a compression ratio of 8.4x and a theoretical inference speed-up of 9.2x for ResNet-110, while the accuracy is even better than the reference model on CIFAR-110.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 130  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 8. DynaBERT: Dynamic BERT with Adaptive Width and Depth\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Lu Hou, Zhiqi Huang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic BERT model, which can run at adaptive width and depth, is proposed (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa, though powerful in many natural language processing tasks, are both computational and memory expensive. To alleviate this problem, one approach is to compress them for specific tasks before deployment. However, recent works on BERT compression usually reduce the large BERT model to a fixed smaller size, and can not fully satisfy the requirements of different edge devices with various hardware performances. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic BERT model (abbreviated as DynaBERT), which can run at adaptive width and depth. The training process of DynaBERT includes first training a width-adaptive BERT and then allows both adaptive width and depth, by distilling knowledge from the full-sized model to small sub-networks. Network rewiring is also used to keep the more important attention heads and neurons shared by more sub-networks. Comprehensive experiments under various efficiency constraints demonstrate that our proposed dynamic BERT (or RoBERTa) at its largest size has comparable performance as BERT (or RoBERTa), while at smaller widths and depths consistently outperforms existing BERT compression methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 296  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 9.

A decoder at the central node decompresses and passes the data to a pre-trained machine learning-based task to generate the final output. Thus, it is important to compress the features that are relevant to the task. Additionally, the final performance depends heavily on the total available bandwidth. In practice, it is common to encounter varying availability in bandwidth, and higher bandwidth results in better performance of the task. We design a novel distributed compression framework composed of independent encoders and a joint decoder, which we call neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA). NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead. NDPCA achieves this by learning low-rank task representations and efficiently distributing bandwidth among sensors, thus providing a graceful trade-off between performance and bandwidth. Experiments show that NDPCA improves the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation by 9% and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery by 14% compared to an autoencoder with uniform bandwidth allocation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FLUPS: a Fourier-based Library of Unbounded Poisson Solvers\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient spectral operations*\n\n*Philippe Chatelain, Thomas Gillis, Denis-Gabriel Caprace*\n\n**Abstract:** A Fourier-based Library of Unbounded Poisson Solvers (FLUPS) for 2-D and 3-D homogeneous distributed grids is presented. It is designed to handle every possible combination of periodic, symmetric, semi-unbounded and fully unbounded boundary conditions for the Poisson equation on rectangular domains with uniform resolution. FLUPS leverages a dedicated implementation of 3-D Fourier transforms to solve the Poisson equation using Green's functions, in a fast and memory-efficient way. Several Green's functions are available, optionally with explicit regularization, spectral truncation, or using Lattice Green's Functions, and provide verified convergence orders from 2 to spectral-like. The algorithm depends on the FFTW library to perform 1-D transforms, while MPI communications enable the required remapping of data in memory. For the latter operation, a first available implementation resorts to the standard all-to-all routines. A second implementation, featuring non-blocking and persistent point-to-point communications, is however shown to be more efficient in a majority of cases and especially while taking advantage of the shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The scalability of the algorithm, aimed at massively parallel architectures, is demonstrated up to 73 720 cores. The results obtained with three different supercomputers show that the weak efficiency remains above 40% and the strong efficiency above 30% when the number of cores is multiplied by 16, for typical problems. These figures are slightly better than those expected from a third party 3-D FFT tool, with which a 20% longer execution time was also measured on average. From the outside, the solving procedure is fully automated so that the user benefits from the optimal performances while not having to handle the complexity associated with memory management, data mapping and Fourier transform computation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. WaveBeat: End-to-end beat and downbeat tracking in the time domain\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient spectral operations*\n\n*Joshua D. Reiss, Christian J. Steinmetz*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches for beat and downbeat tracking have brought advancements. However, these approaches continue to rely on hand-crafted, subsampled spectral features as input, restricting the information available to the model. In this work, we propose WaveBeat, an end-to-end approach for joint beat and downbeat tracking operating directly on waveforms. This method forgoes engineered spectral features, and instead, produces beat and downbeat predictions directly from the waveform, the first of its kind for this task. Our model utilizes temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) operating on waveforms that achieve a very large receptive field ($\\geq$ 30 s) at audio sample rates in a memory efficient manner by employing rapidly growing dilation factors with fewer layers. With a straightforward data augmentation strategy, our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on some datasets, while producing comparable results on others, demonstrating the potential for time domain approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Generalization through Memorization: Nearest Neighbor Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space language models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Omer Levy, Mike Lewis, Dan Jurafsky, Urvashi Khandelwal*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce $k$NN-LMs, which extend a pre-trained neural language model (LM) by linearly interpolating it with a $k$-nearest neighbors ($k$NN) model. The nearest neighbors are computed according to distance in the pre-trained LM embedding space, and can be drawn from any text collection, including the original LM training data. Applying this augmentation to a strong Wikitext-103 LM, with neighbors drawn from the original training set, our $k$NN-LM achieves a new state-of-the-art perplexity of 15.79 - a 2.9 point improvement with no additional training. We also show that this approach has implications for efficiently scaling up to larger training sets and allows for effective domain adaptation, by simply varying the nearest neighbor datastore, again without further training. Qualitatively, the model is particularly helpful in predicting rare patterns, such as factual knowledge. Together, these results strongly suggest that learning similarity between sequences of text is easier than predicting the next word, and that nearest neighbor search is an effective approach for language modeling in the long tail.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Towards Large-scale 3D Representation Learning with Multi-dataset Point Prompt Training\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space language models*\n\n*Hengshuang Zhao, Kaicheng Yu, Xihui Liu, Bohao Peng, Xin Wen, Zhuotao Tian, Xiaoyang Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of deep learning models often attributes to their ability to leverage massive training data. In contrast, such privilege has not yet fully benefited 3D deep learning, mainly due to the limited availability of large-scale 3D datasets. Merging multiple available data sources and letting them collaboratively train a single model is a potential solution. However, due to the large domain gap between 3D point cloud datasets, such mixed supervision could adversely affect the model's performance and lead to degenerated performance (i.e., negative transfer) compared to single-dataset training. In view of this challenge, we introduce Point Prompt Training (PPT), a novel framework for multi-dataset synergistic learning in the context of 3D representation learning that supports multiple pre-training paradigms. Based on this framework, we propose Prompt-driven Normalization, which adapts the model to different datasets with domain-specific prompts and Language-guided Categorical Alignment that decently unifies the multiple-dataset label spaces by leveraging the relationship between label text. Extensive experiments verify that PPT can overcome the negative transfer associated with synergistic learning and produce generalizable representations. Notably, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on each dataset using a single weight-shared model with supervised multi-dataset training. Moreover, when served as a pre-training framework, it outperforms other pre-training approaches regarding representation quality and attains remarkable state-of-the-art performance across over ten diverse downstream tasks spanning both indoor and outdoor 3D scenarios.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-18\n\n\n\n#### 5. Efficient neural networks for real-time modeling of analog dynamic range compression\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Joshua D. Reiss, Christian J. Steinmetz*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning approaches have demonstrated success in modeling analog audio effects. Nevertheless, challenges remain in modeling more complex effects that involve time-varying nonlinear elements, such as dynamic range compressors. Existing neural network approaches for modeling compression either ignore the device parameters, do not attain sufficient accuracy, or otherwise require large noncausal models prohibiting real-time operation. In this work, we propose a modification to temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) enabling greater efficiency without sacrificing performance. By utilizing very sparse convolutional kernels through rapidly growing dilations, our model attains a significant receptive field using fewer layers, reducing computation. Through a detailed evaluation we demonstrate our efficient and causal approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in modeling the analog LA-2A, is capable of real-time operation on CPU, and only requires 10 minutes of training data.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. SCOP: Scientific Control for Reliable Neural Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic compression neural networks*\n\n*Chang Xu, Chao Xu, Chunjing Xu, DaCheng Tao, Yixing Xu, Yunhe Wang, Yehui Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a reliable neural network pruning algorithm by setting up a scientific control. Existing pruning methods have developed various hypotheses to approximate the importance of filters to the network and then execute filter pruning accordingly. To increase the reliability of the results, we prefer to have a more rigorous research design by including a scientific control group as an essential part to minimize the effect of all factors except the association between the filter and expected network output. Acting as a control group, knockoff feature is generated to mimic the feature map produced by the network filter, but they are conditionally independent of the example label given the real feature map. We theoretically suggest that the knockoff condition can be approximately preserved given the information propagation of network layers. Besides the real feature map on an intermediate layer, the corresponding knockoff feature is brought in as another auxiliary input signal for the subsequent layers. Redundant filters can be discovered in the adversarial process of different features. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method can reduce 57.8% parameters and 60.2% FLOPs of ResNet-101 with only 0.01% top-1 accuracy loss on ImageNet.

It proposes saving the output tensor instead of the input tensor for pointwise nonlinearity layers, significantly reducing memory requirements. This approach can be beneficial for transformer-based architectures, which often involve spectral or Fourier transform operations.\n\n- The \"Natural GaLore\" method described in another paper reduces the memory footprint by approximating the optimizer state using low-rank structures of gradients. This can be particularly useful when integrating spectral operations, as it helps manage the memory overhead associated with these computations.\n\n## Applications of Adaptive State Space Models in Language Modeling\n\n- The \"Spectral State Space Models\" paper provides a strong theoretical foundation for using spectral methods in state space models (SSMs). It highlights that spectral filtering can offer robustness independent of the spectrum of underlying dynamics, which is beneficial for language modeling where long-term dependencies are common. However, it does not specifically address adaptive state space models, but it sets a groundwork for further adaptation [Analysis].\n\n- For adaptive state space models, the gap in current research is noted in the initial analysis. However, papers like \"There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs\" discuss parameterization schemes for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems that could be adapted for state space models in language modeling, providing non-decaying memory capabilities[Analysis].\n\n## Dynamic Compression Techniques for Sequential Models\n\n- The \"Natural GaLore\" paper introduces a method that leverages low-rank approximations of gradients, which can be seen as a form of dynamic compression. This approach reduces memory usage significantly while maintaining model performance, making it suitable for sequential models like autoregressive language models.\n\n- \"Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore)\" and its variants, such as LoRA and ReLoRA, are discussed in the context of reducing memory usage during fine-tuning and pre-training of large language models. These methods involve approximating optimizer states and using low-rank adapters, which can be considered dynamic compression techniques for sequential models.\n\n## Numerical Stability Analysis of Spectral Methods in Deep Learning\n\n- The initial analysis highlights the need for numerical stability considerations when using spectral methods, particularly FFT operations. While the provided sources do not delve deeply into numerical stability analysis, the \"Spectral State Space Models\" paper and related works on robustifying state-space models via approximate diagonalization provide some insights into maintaining stability in spectral methods[Analysis].\n\n## Integration of FFT Operations in Neural Network Architectures\n\n- The integration of FFT operations is not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, but the concept of using spectral methods in state space models suggests that FFT operations could be integrated to leverage their efficiency in handling long-term dependencies. The computational overhead and memory efficiency trade-offs of FFT operations need to be carefully considered, as noted in the initial analysis[Analysis].\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on:\n\n- Implementing memory-efficient spectral operations using techniques like saving output tensors instead of input tensors and leveraging low-rank approximations of gradients.\n- Adapting state space models with spectral filtering to enhance robustness and handle long-term dependencies, potentially integrating adaptive dimensionality and parameterization schemes[Analysis].\n- Employing dynamic compression techniques such as GaLore and its variants to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.\n- Conducting thorough numerical stability analysis to ensure the robustness of spectral methods in deep learning architectures[Analysis].\n\nThese approaches can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/54 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Score: 0.05)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

MEC: Memory-efficient Convolution for Deep Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient FFT neural networks*\n\n*Minsik Cho, D. Brand*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process and reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution is a critical component in modern deep neural networks, thus several algorithms for convolution have been developed. Direct convolution is simple but suffers from poor performance. As an alternative, multiple indirect methods have been proposed including im2col-based convolution, FFT-based convolution, or Winograd-based algorithm. However, all these indirect methods have high memory-overhead, which creates performance degradation and offers a poor trade-off between performance and memory consumption. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient convolution or MEC with compact lowering, which reduces memory-overhead substantially and accelerates convolution process. MEC lowers the input matrix in a simple yet efficient/compact way (i.e., much less memory-overhead), and then executes multiple small matrix multiplications in parallel to get convolution completed. Additionally, the reduced memory footprint improves memory sub-system efficiency, improving performance. Our experimental results show that MEC reduces memory consumption significantly with good speedup on both mobile and server platforms, compared with other indirect convolution algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 80  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2. A new perspective on building efficient and expressive 3D equivariant graph neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient FFT neural networks*\n\n*Weitao Du, Yuanqi Du, Limei Wang, Dieqiao Feng, Guifeng Wang, Shuiwang Ji, Carla P. Gomes, Zhixin Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism is proposed to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches to demonstrate the applicability of the theory.\n\n**Abstract:** Geometric deep learning enables the encoding of physical symmetries in modeling 3D objects. Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks. We further point out the design space for future developments of equivariant graph neural networks.

EIGNN: Efficient Infinite-Depth Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient FFT neural networks*\n\n*Juncheng Liu, Kenji Kawaguchi, Bryan Hooi, Yiwei Wang, X. Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work theoretically derive a closed-form solution of EIGNN which makes training an infinite-depth GNN model tractable, and shows that the model is also more robust against both noise and adversarial perturbations on node features.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for modelling graph-structured data in numerous applications. However, with their inherently finite aggregation layers, existing GNN models may not be able to effectively capture long-range dependencies in the underlying graphs. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a GNN model with infinite depth, which we call Efficient Infinite-Depth Graph Neural Networks (EIGNN), to efficiently capture very long-range dependencies. We theoretically derive a closed-form solution of EIGNN which makes training an infinite-depth GNN model tractable. We then further show that we can achieve more efficient computation for training EIGNN by using eigendecomposition. The empirical results of comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that EIGNN has a better ability to capture long-range dependencies than recent baselines, and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our model is also more robust against both noise and adversarial perturbations on node features.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Robustifying Generalizable Implicit Shape Networks with a Tunable Non-Parametric Model\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space stability*\n\n*Amine Ouasfi, A. Boukhayma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A efficient mechanism to remedy generalization issues in forward generalizable models for implicit shape reconstruction from unoriented point cloud by combining the inter-shape data prior of the network with an intra-shape regularization prior of a Nystr\\\"om Kernel Ridge Regression.\n\n**Abstract:** Feedforward generalizable models for implicit shape reconstruction from unoriented point cloud present multiple advantages, including high performance and inference speed. However, they still suffer from generalization issues, ranging from underfitting the input point cloud, to misrepresenting samples outside of the training data distribution, or with toplogies unseen at training. We propose here an efficient mechanism to remedy some of these limitations at test time. We combine the inter-shape data prior of the network with an intra-shape regularization prior of a Nystr\\\"om Kernel Ridge Regression, that we further adapt by fitting its hyperprameters to the current shape. The resulting shape function defined in a shape specific Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space benefits from desirable stability and efficiency properties and grants a shape adaptive expressiveness-robustness trade-off. We demonstrate the improvement obtained through our method with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space stability*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space stability*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware spectral operations*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

Vector-Vector-Matrix Architecture: A Novel Hardware-Aware Framework for Low-Latency Inference in NLP Applications\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware spectral operations*\n\n*Matthew Khoury, Rumen Dangovski, L. Ou, Preslav Nakov, Yichen Shen, L. Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA) is proposed, which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT and reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become the standard approach to building reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, ranging from Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to dialogue systems. However, improving accuracy by increasing the model size requires a large number of hardware computations, which can slow down NLP applications significantly at inference time. To address this issue, we propose a novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA), which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT. This architecture takes advantage of specialized hardware that has low-latency vector-vector operations and higher-latency vector-matrix operations. It also reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy. We present empirical results suggesting that our framework can reduce the latency of sequence-to-sequence and Transformer models used for NMT by a factor of four. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that our VVMA extends to other domains, and we discuss novel hardware for its efficient use.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Locality-Aware Graph-Rewiring in GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware spectral operations*\n\n*Federico Barbero, A. Velingker, Amin Saberi, Michael M. Bronstein, Francesco Di Giovanni*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel rewiring framework is proposed that satisfies all of the desiderata for graph-rewiring (i) reduce over-squashing, (ii) respect the locality of the graph, and (iii) preserve the sparsity of thegraph.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are popular models for machine learning on graphs that typically follow the message-passing paradigm, whereby the feature of a node is updated recursively upon aggregating information over its neighbors. While exchanging messages over the input graph endows GNNs with a strong inductive bias, it can also make GNNs susceptible to over-squashing, thereby preventing them from capturing long-range interactions in the given graph. To rectify this issue, graph rewiring techniques have been proposed as a means of improving information flow by altering the graph connectivity. In this work, we identify three desiderata for graph-rewiring: (i) reduce over-squashing, (ii) respect the locality of the graph, and (iii) preserve the sparsity of the graph. We highlight fundamental trade-offs that occur between spatial and spectral rewiring techniques; while the former often satisfy (i) and (ii) but not (iii), the latter generally satisfy (i) and (iii) at the expense of (ii). We propose a novel rewiring framework that satisfies all of (i)--(iii) through a locality-aware sequence of rewiring operations. We then discuss a specific instance of such rewiring framework and validate its effectiveness on several real-world benchmarks, showing that it either matches or significantly outperforms existing rewiring approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Spherical CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient FFT neural networks*\n\n*Max Welling, Jonas Koehler, Taco S. Cohen, Mario Geiger*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the method of choice for\nlearning problems involving 2D planar images. However, a number of problems of\nrecent interest have created a demand for models that can analyze spherical\nimages. Examples include omnidirectional vision for drones, robots, and\nautonomous cars, molecular regression problems, and global weather and climate\nmodelling. A naive application of convolutional networks to a planar projection\nof the spherical signal is destined to fail, because the space-varying\ndistortions introduced by such a projection will make translational weight\nsharing ineffective.\n  In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical\nCNNs.

BirdNET: A deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring\n\n*From Search Query: efficient FFT neural networks*\n\n*Holger Klinck, Maximilian Eibl, Connor M. Wood, Stefan Kahl*\n\n**Abstract:** Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally, such data were collected by expert observers, but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However, efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning, frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN, called BirdNET, capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets), consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters, and was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22,960 single-species recordings; (b) 286 h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33,670 h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g., object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary, BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings, a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes, and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4 years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data, BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.\n\n**Proceeding:** ecological-informatics-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space stability*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Large-scale Traffic Signal Control\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state space stability*\n\n*Lara Codec\u00e0, Zhaojian Li, Jie Wang, Tianshu Chu*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising data-driven approach for adaptive\ntraffic signal control (ATSC) in complex urban traffic networks, and deep\nneural networks further enhance its learning power. However, centralized RL is\ninfeasible for large-scale ATSC due to the extremely high dimension of the\njoint action space. Multi-agent RL (MARL) overcomes the scalability issue by\ndistributing the global control to each local RL agent, but it introduces new\nchallenges: now the environment becomes partially observable from the viewpoint\nof each local agent due to limited communication among agents. Most existing\nstudies in MARL focus on designing efficient communication and coordination\namong traditional Q-learning agents. This paper presents, for the first time, a\nfully scalable and decentralized MARL algorithm for the state-of-the-art deep\nRL agent: advantage actor critic (A2C), within the context of ATSC. In\nparticular, two methods are proposed to stabilize the learning procedure, by\nimproving the observability and reducing the learning difficulty of each local\nagent. The proposed multi-agent A2C is compared against independent A2C and\nindependent Q-learning algorithms, in both a large synthetic traffic grid and a\nlarge real-world traffic network of Monaco city, under simulated peak-hour\ntraffic dynamics. Results demonstrate its optimality, robustness, and sample\nefficiency over other state-of-the-art decentralized MARL algorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on efficient FFT implementations, adaptive state space stability, and memory-efficient techniques, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of FFT and Spectral Operations in Neural Networks\n\n- The paper \"Efficient State Space Model via Fast Tensor Convolution and Block Diagonalization\" discusses the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to improve the efficiency of state space models. It highlights the application of diagonalization and fast tensor convolution via FFT to reduce the number of model parameters and improve computational efficiency. This approach significantly reduces training and inference time, making it a viable option for neural networks.\n\n- The work on \"Analog fast Fourier transforms for scalable and efficient signal processing\" shows how FFT can be mapped to analog in-memory computing systems, enabling efficient scaling to large Fourier transforms. This approach can be particularly beneficial for reducing energy consumption and improving the efficiency of spectral operations in neural networks.\n\n## Stability Analysis and Convergence Properties of Adaptive State Space Models\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model\" paper also addresses the stability and efficiency of adaptive state space models. It introduces a block-diagonal state space model (eSSM) that improves the diversity and efficiency of the models. The use of bidirectional kernels and block diagonalization strategies enhances the model's robustness and convergence properties, which is crucial for adaptive systems.\n\n- The reference to \"Robustifying State-space Models\" by Yu et al. (2023) in the analysis note highlights the theoretical analysis of transfer functions for different initialization schemes, demonstrating strong convergence properties while maintaining robustness to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs. This is directly relevant to the stability analysis of adaptive state space models[3 in the analysis note].\n\n## Memory-Efficient Techniques for Handling Spectral Operations in Deep Learning\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model\" paper discusses the use of diagonalization and fast tensor convolution, which significantly reduces the number of model parameters and improves memory efficiency. The block diagonalization strategy further enhances this by splitting the input vector into multiple sub-vectors, reducing the overall memory footprint.\n\n- The \"LightMed\" model, which uses FFT for medical image segmentation, demonstrates how focusing on low-frequency image components can reduce computational complexity while preserving essential features. This approach can be adapted to reduce memory usage in deep learning models by efficiently handling spectral operations.\n\n## Methods for Maintaining Numerical Stability in Adaptive Systems\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model\" paper emphasizes the importance of numerical stability in adaptive systems. The use of diagonalization and fast tensor convolution via FFT helps in maintaining numerical stability by reducing the complexity of the convolution operations and ensuring that the model remains stable during training and inference.\n\n- The analysis note references \"Robustifying State-space Models\" which provides a detailed theoretical analysis on maintaining robustness and numerical stability in state-space models, particularly under Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs[3 in the analysis note].\n\n## Dynamic Compression Techniques Specifically for Sequential Models\n\n- While the papers directly mentioned do not focus exclusively on dynamic compression techniques for sequential models, the concept of block diagonalization in the \"Efficient State Space Model\" can be seen as a form of dynamic compression. By splitting the input vector into multiple sub-vectors and modeling them separately, it allows for more efficient handling of varying input complexities, which can be extended to dynamic compression techniques.\n\n- The need for dynamic state sizing in SSMs, as mentioned in the analysis note, suggests that further research into adaptive dimensionality could lead to methods for dynamic compression in sequential models. This would involve investigating how to adjust the state size dynamically to handle varying input complexities efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the efficient state space model (eSSM) and the analog FFT implementations provide strong foundations for improving the efficiency, stability, and memory usage of autoregressive language models. The focus on spectral operations, adaptive state space stability, and memory-efficient techniques aligns well with the goals outlined in the analysis note.\n",

Title\nAdaptiveSpectralSSD: A Dynamic State Space Model with Spectral Filtering for Efficient Sequence Processing\n\n### 2. Motivation\nCurrent state space models (SSMs) face several challenges:\n- Fixed state dimensions regardless of input complexity\n- Computationally intensive gradient computations\n- Inefficient memory utilization\n- Limited ability to balance model capacity with computational efficiency\n\n### 3. Problem Analysis\nThe SSDMinimalDiscrete unit in Mamba2 uses a fixed-size state representation, which can be either wasteful for simple patterns or insufficient for complex dependencies. Additionally, the gradient computation and state updates require significant computational resources, especially for long sequences.\n\n### 4. Core Idea and Philosophy\nWe propose combining adaptive state dimensionality with spectral filtering to create a more efficient and flexible SSM. The core innovations are:\n1. Dynamic state sizing based on input complexity\n2. Spectral decomposition for efficient state updates\n3. Adaptive compression of state representations\n\n### 5. Design Plan\n\n#### 5.1 Modifications to SSDMinimalDiscrete\n\n1. Adaptive State Dimension:\n```python\ndef compute_state_dimension(self, x):\n    # Compute input complexity using spectral analysis\n    freq_components = torch.fft.fft(x, dim=-1)\n    complexity_score = torch.sum(torch.abs(freq_components) > self.threshold)\n    # Map complexity to state dimension\n    state_dim = self.base_dim * (1 + torch.log1p(complexity_score))\n    return min(self.max_dim, max(self.min_dim, state_dim))\n```\n\n2. Spectral State Update:\n```python\ndef spectral_state_update(self, x, state, A):\n    # Transform state to frequency domain\n    state_freq = torch.fft.fft(state, dim=-1)\n    # Apply state transition in frequency domain\n    next_state_freq = state_freq * torch.exp(A)\n    # Transform back to time domain\n    next_state = torch.fft.ifft(next_state_freq, dim=-1)\n    return next_state.real\n```\n\n3. Adaptive Compression:\n```python\ndef compress_state(self, state, target_dim):\n    # Project state to lower dimension using SVD\n    U, S, V = torch.svd(state)\n    compressed = torch.matmul(U[:, :target_dim], \n                            torch.diag(S[:target_dim]))\n    return compressed\n```\n\n#### 5.2 Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe modified state update equation becomes:\n\n$h_t = f_{\\text{spectral}}(A(x_t) \\circ h_{t-1} + B(x_t))$\n\nwhere $f_{\\text{spectral}}$ is the spectral filtering operation:\n\n$f_{\\text{spectral}}(h) = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\phi(\\mathcal{F}(h)))$\n\nand $\\phi$ is a learnable spectral filter.\n\nThe adaptive state dimension is computed as:\n\n$d(x) = \\min(d_{\\max}, \\max(d_{\\min}, d_{\\text{base}} \\cdot (1 + \\log(1 + \\|\\mathcal{F}(x)\\|_0))))$\n\n### 6. Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. State Initialization:\n```python\nclass AdaptiveSpectralSSD(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, base_dim, min_dim, max_dim, threshold):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.base_dim = base_dim\n        self.min_dim = min_dim\n        self.max_dim = max_dim\n        self.threshold = threshold\n        self.spectral_filter = nn.Parameter(\n            torch.randn(max_dim))\n```\n\n2. Forward Pass:\n```python\ndef forward(self, x, state=None):\n    # Compute required state dimension\n    state_dim = self.compute_state_dimension(x)\n    \n    # Initialize or adjust state\n    if state is None:\n        state = torch.zeros(x.shape[0], state_dim)\n    elif state.shape[1] != state_dim:\n        state = self.compress_state(state, state_dim)\n    \n    # Apply spectral state update\n    next_state = self.spectral_state_update(x, state, self.A)\n    \n    # Output computation\n    y = self.output_projection(next_state)\n    return y, next_state\n```\n\n### 7. Research Summary\n\nKey findings from research:\n- Spectral filtering can reduce gradient computation complexity\n- Adaptive state sizing improves efficiency without sacrificing capacity\n- Dynamic compression maintains information while reducing memory usage\n\n### 8. Evolution of Design\n\nThe design evolved through several stages:\n1. Initial focus on adaptive state dimension\n2. Integration of spectral filtering for efficient computation\n3. Addition of dynamic compression for memory efficiency\n4. Refinement of spectral filter parameterization\n\n### 9. Theoretical Analysis\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Reduced computational complexity: O(n log n) vs O(n\u00b2) for standard SSMs\n2. Memory efficiency through adaptive state sizing\n3. Better gradient flow through spectral decomposition\n4. Improved handling of varying input complexities\n\nTrade-offs:\n1. Additional overhead from FFT computations\n2. Need for careful threshold tuning\n3. Potential numerical stability considerations\n\n### 10. Conclusion\n\nAdaptiveSpectralSSD offers several key improvements:\n- Dynamic adaptation to input complexity\n- Efficient gradient computation through spectral methods\n- Reduced memory footprint through adaptive compression\n- Improved information flow through spectral filtering\n\n### 11.
