These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer \n\nSimiao Zuo ${ }^{* \\ddagger}$, Xiaodong Liu ${ }^{* \\dagger \\wedge}$, Jian Jiao ${ }^{\\dagger \\diamond}$, Denis Charles ${ }^{\\diamond}$, Eren Manavoglu ${ }^{\\wedge}$,<br>Tuo Zhao ${ }^{\\ddagger}$ and Jianfeng Gao ${ }^{\\circ}$<br>${ }^{\\ddagger}$ Georgia Institute of Technology ${ }^{\\diamond}$ Microsoft\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DenseSSM is introduced, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, and retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention improvements, state space Transformers, efficient long-sequence modeling\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, the original FWP formulation is more general than the one of linear Transformers: a slow neural network (NN) continually reprograms the weights of a fast NN with arbitrary architecture. In existing linear Transformers, both NNs are feedforward and consist of a single layer. Here we explore new variations by adding recurrence to the slow and fast nets. We evaluate our novel recurrent FWPs (RFWPs) on two synthetic algorithmic tasks (code execution and sequential ListOps), Wikitext-103 language models, and on the Atari 2600 2D game environment. Our models exhibit properties of Transformers and RNNs. In the reinforcement learning setting, we report large improvements over LSTM in several Atari games.

Quantum-Inspired Algorithms from Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention improvements*\n\n*Nadiia Chepurko, K. Clarkson, L. Horesh, David P. Woodruff*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work creates classical (non-quantum) dynamic data structures supporting queries for recommender systems and least-squares regression that are comparable to their quantum analogues and introduces a new randomized transform, the Gaussian Randomized Hadamard Transform (GRHT).\n\n**Abstract:** We create classical (non-quantum) dynamic data structures supporting queries for recommender systems and least-squares regression that are comparable to their quantum analogues. De-quantizing such algorithms has received a flurry of attention in recent years; we obtain sharper bounds for these problems. More significantly, we achieve these improvements by arguing that the previous quantum-inspired algorithms for these problems are doing leverage or ridge-leverage score sampling in disguise. With this recognition, we are able to employ the large body of work in numerical linear algebra to obtain algorithms for these problems that are simpler and faster than existing approaches. \nWe also consider static data structures for the above problems, and obtain close-to-optimal bounds for them. To do this, we introduce a new randomized transform, the Gaussian Randomized Hadamard Transform (GRHT). It was thought in the numerical linear algebra community that to obtain nearly-optimal bounds for various problems such as rank computation, finding a maximal linearly independent subset of columns, regression, low rank approximation, maximum matching on general graphs and linear matroid union, that one would need to resolve the main open question of Nelson and Nguyen (FOCS, 2013) regarding the logarithmic factors in existing oblivious subspace embeddings. We bypass this question, using GRHT, and obtain optimal or nearly-optimal bounds for these problems. For the fundamental problems of rank computation and finding a linearly independent subset of columns, our algorithms improve Cheung, Kwok, and Lau (JACM, 2013) and are optimal to within a constant factor and a $\\log\\log(n)$-factor, respectively. Further, for constant factor regression and low rank approximation we give the first optimal algorithms, for the current matrix multiplication exponent.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 215  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 5. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence modeling*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime.

SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence modeling*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. CAB: Comprehensive Attention Benchmarking on Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence modeling*\n\n*Jinchao Zhang, Shuyang Jiang, Jiangtao Feng, Lin Zheng, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self,Noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions, and sheds light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved remarkable success in language, image, and speech processing. Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention improvements*\n\n*Anirudh Ravula, Santiago Ontanon, Manzil Zaheer, Chris Alberti, Avinava Dubey, Philip Pham, Joshua Ainslie, Amr Ahmed, Qifan Wang, Li Yang, Guru Guruganesh*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention improvements*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: state space Transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: state space Transformers*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 6. Dual-path RNN: efficient long sequence modeling for time-domain single-channel speech separation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long-sequence modeling*\n\n*Zhuo Chen, Yi Luo, Takuya Yoshioka*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in deep learning-based speech separation have proven the superiority of time-domain approaches to conventional time-frequency-based methods. Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain separation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of time steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences. Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling such long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level sequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length. In this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple yet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model extremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller chunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the input length can be made proportional to the square root of the original sequence length in each operation. Experiments show that by replacing 1-D CNN with DPRNN and apply sample-level modeling in the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a new state-of-the-art performance on WSJ0-2mix is achieved with a 20 times smaller model than the previous best system.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating state-space models (SSMs) into the linear attention mechanism of the FastTTTLinear GAU for efficient long-sequence modeling, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## State Space Models (SSMs) for Long-Sequence Modeling\n\n- **Efficiency and Long-Range Dependencies**: SSMs, such as those described in the researcher's analysis, are designed to capture long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity. For example, the S4 model mentioned in the analysis uses structured state space matrices to achieve this efficiency.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Block-Attention**: This mechanism divides the input into discrete blocks and calculates key-value states independently for each block, except for the final block. This approach significantly reduces latency and computational overhead, making it efficient for long sequences. The Block-Attention model achieves performance comparable to or even superior to self-attention models after fine-tuning.\n- **Linear Attention in Image Generation**: The use of linear attention, such as ReLU linear attention, reduces computational complexity compared to traditional softmax attention. This approach achieves higher efficiency without compromising performance, which is relevant for adapting to text-based models.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Long Sequences\n\n- **FlashAttention**: This algorithm is designed to compute exact attention efficiently by using techniques like tiling and recomputation. It reduces memory usage and computation time, making it suitable for long sequences. FlashAttention-2 further enhances this by parallelizing over the sequence length and optimizing memory access.\n- **SwiftFormer**: This model introduces an efficient additive attention mechanism that replaces quadratic matrix multiplication with linear element-wise multiplications. This approach is particularly beneficial for real-time applications and could be adapted for long-sequence modeling in language models.\n\n## Integration of SSMs into Linear Attention\n\n- **Structured State Space Matrices**: Integrating SSMs into the FastTTTLinear GAU could involve using structured state space matrices that allow for efficient computation of long-range dependencies. This integration would need to ensure compatibility with the GAU framework and maintain input-output dimensions[Analysis Note].\n- **Optimization Techniques**: To optimize SSM computations, methods like HiPPO (High-Order Polynomial Projection Operators) could be explored. Additionally, hardware-efficient implementations of SSMs should be considered to ensure scalability and stability[Analysis Note].\n\n## Practical Implementations and Future Directions\n\n- **Recent Integrations and Optimizations**: Investigate recent works that have successfully combined SSMs with attention mechanisms, such as the S4D and Mega models. These works can provide insights into practical implementations and optimization techniques[Analysis Note].\n- **Open-Source Implementations**: Review open-source implementations of SSMs in language models to understand how they handle training stability and scalability. This can provide practical guidance for implementing SSMs in the FastTTTLinear GAU[Analysis Note].\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Block-Attention and Linear Attention**: These mechanisms offer significant reductions in computational complexity and latency, making them suitable for long-sequence modeling. Integrating these with SSMs could enhance the efficiency and performance of the FastTTTLinear GAU.\n- **FlashAttention and SwiftFormer**: These models provide strategies for efficient attention computation that can be adapted for integrating SSMs into the GAU framework.\n- **Optimization and Practical Implementations**: Focus on using structured state space matrices, optimizing SSM computations, and reviewing open-source implementations to ensure a stable and scalable integration.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researcher can design an efficient and effective integration of SSMs into the FastTTTLinear GAU, enhancing its ability to model long sequences efficiently.\n",

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 2.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants.

Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the `FastTTTLinear` Generalized Autoregressive (GAU) model by integrating **State Space Models (SSMs)** to improve its ability to model long sequences, while maintaining computational efficiency and compatibility with test-time training (TTT).

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nin the style of Megatron (Shoeybi et al. 2019)). The main ideas include introducing grouped-value attention (GVA) head structure, and moving all data-dependent projections to occur in parallel at the beginning of the block. The combination of the modified parallel Mamba block, together with using SSD as the inner SSM layer, results in the Mamba-2 architecture. We investigate Chinchilla scaling laws for Mamba-2 in the same setting as Mamba, finding that it Pareto dominates Mamba and Transformer++ in both perplexity and wall-clock time. We additionally train a family of\n\nMamba-2 models at varying sizes on the Pile, showing that it matches or outperforms Mamba and open source Transformers on standard downstream evaluations. For example, Mamba-2 with 2.7B parameters trained on 300B tokens on the Pile outperforms Mamba-2.8B, Pythia-2.8B and even Pythia-6.9B trained on the same dataset. Systems Optimizations. The SSD framework connects SSMs and Transformers, allowing us to leverage a rich body of work on systems optimizations developed for Transformers (Section 8). - For example, Tensor Parallelism (TP) is an important model parallelism technique to train large Transformer models by splitting each layer across GPUs on the same node. We design Mamba-2 to be TP-friendly, reducing the number of synchronization point per block by half. - For very long sequences whose activations do not fit on one device, sequence parallelism has been developed for the attention blocks. We describe how to train SSMs in general and Mamba-2 in particular with sequence parallelism, by passing the recurrent states between devices. - For finetuning with examples of different lengths, for best efficiency, Transformer requires sophisticated techniques to remove padding tokens and perform attention on variable length sequences. We show how Mamba-2 can be trained with variable sequence lengths efficiently, requiring no padding tokens. Section 9 empirically validates Mamba-2 on language modeling, training efficiency, and a difficult multi-query associative recall task (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024). Finally, in Section 10, we provide an extended related work and discuss potential research directions opened up by our framework. Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 Background and Overview\n\n### 2.1 Structured State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a 1-dimensional sequence $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top}$ through an implicit latent state $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, N)}$. A general discrete form of structured SSMs takes the form of equation (1). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A h_{t-1}+B x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A_{t} h_{t-1}+B_{t} x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C_{t}^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, N)}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}$. Structured SSMs are so named because the $A$ matrix controlling the temporal dynamics must be structured in order to compute this sequence-to-sequence transformation efficiently enough to be used in deep neural networks. The original structures introduced were diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022) and diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which remains the most popular structure. In this work, we use the term state space model (SSM) to refer to structured SSMs. There are many flavors of such SSMs, with deep ties to several major paradigms of neural sequence models such as continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). We provide a brief overview below, and refer to prior work for more context and details (Gu 2023; Gu and Dao 2023). Continuous-time Models. The original structured SSMs originated as continuous-time maps on functions $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto$ $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, rather than operating directly on sequences. In the continuous-time perspective, in equation (1a) the matrices $(A, B)$ are not directly learned but generated from underlying parameters $(\\AA, B)$, along with a parameterized step size $\\Delta$. The \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, \\AA, B)$ are converted to \"discrete parameters\" $(A, B)$ through fixed formulas $A=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\AA)$ and $B=f_{B}(\\Delta, B)$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Remark 1. While our main models adopt the same parameterization and discretization step as prior work (see Gu and Dao (2023) for details), for simplifying exposition and notation we omit it in the rest of this paper. We note that prior work on\nstructured SSMs referred to the continuous parameters $(\\AA$, have changed notation to simplify the presentation and focus directly on the discrete parameters, which govern the main SSM recurrence. Recurrent Models. Equations (1) and (2) take the form of a recurrence which is linear in its input $x$. Structured SSMs can therefore be viewed as types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the linearity endows them with additional properties and allows them to avoid the sequential computation of traditional RNNs. Conversely, despite this simplification, SSMs are still fully expressive as sequence transformations (in the sense of universal approximation) (Kaul 2020; Orvieto et al. 2023; Shida Wang and Xue 2023). Convolutional Models. When the SSM's dynamics are constant through time as in equation (1), the model is called linear time-invariant (LTI). In this case, they are equivalent to convolutions. Thus, SSMs can also be viewed as types of CNNs, but where (i) the convolution kernels are implicitly parameterized through the SSM parameters $(A, B, C)$ and (ii) the convolution kernels are generally global instead of local. Conversely, through classical signal processing theory all sufficiently well-behaved convolutions can be represented as SSMs. Commonly, previous LTI SSMs would use the convolutional mode for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (1) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one step at a time). Selective State Space Models. The form (2) where the parameters $(A, B, C)$ can also vary in time was introduced in Mamba as the selective SSM. Compared to the standard LTI formulation (1), this model can selectively choose to focus on or ignore inputs at every timestep. It was shown to perform much better than LTI SSMs on information-dense data such as language, especially as its state size N increases allowing for more information capacity. However, it can only be computed in recurrent instead of convolutional mode, and requires a careful hardware-aware implementation to be efficient. Even so, it is still less efficient than hardware-friendly models such as CNNs and Transformers because it does not leverage matrix multiplication units, which modern accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are specialized for. While time-invariant SSMs are closely related to continuous, recurrent, and convolutional sequence models, they are not directly related to attention. In this paper, we show a deeper relationship between selective SSMs and attention, and use it to significantly improve the training speed of SSMs while simultaneously allowing for much larger state sizes N . ## Structured SSMs as Sequence Transformations. Definition 2.1. We use the term sequence transformation to refer to a parameterized map on sequences $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ where $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ and $\\theta$ is an arbitrary collection of parameters. T represents the sequence or time axis; subscripts index into the first dimension, e.g. $X_{t}, Y_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P}$. Sequence transformations (e.g. SSMs, or self-attention) are the cornerstone of deep sequence models, where they are incorporated into neural network architectures (e.g. Transformers). The SSM in (1) or (2) is a sequence transformation with $P=1$; it can be generalized to $P>1$ by simply broadcasting across this dimension (in other words, viewing the input as $P$ independent sequences and applying the SSM to each). One can think of $P$ as a head dimension, which we will elaborate on in Section 7. Definition 2.2. We define the SSM operator $\\operatorname{SSM}(A, B, C)=\\operatorname{SSM}\\left(A_{0: T}, B_{0: T}, C_{0: T}\\right)$ as the sequence transformation $X \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})} \\mapsto Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ defined by equation (2). In SSMs, the $N$ dimension is a free parameter called the state size or state dimension. We also call it the state expansion factor, because it expands the size of the input/output by a factor of $N$, with implications for the computational efficiency of these models. Finally, we remark that many types of sequence transformations, such as attention, can be represented as a single matrix multiplication across the sequence dimension. Definition 2.3. We call a sequence transformation $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ a matrix transformation if it can be written in the form $Y=M_{\\theta} X$ where $M$ is a matrix depending on the parameters $\\theta$. We identify the sequence transformation with the matrix $M$, and often drop the dependence on $\\theta$ when clear from context. ### 2.2 Attention\n\nAttention broadly refers to a type of computation that assigns scores to every pair of positions in a sequence, allowing each element to \"attend\" to the rest. By far the most common and important variant of attention is softmax self-attention, which can be defined as\n\n$$\nY=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V\n$$\n\nfor $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, \\mathrm{P})}$. The mechanism of pairwise comparisons (induced by materializing $Q K^{\\top}$ ) leads to the characteristic quadratic training cost of attention. Many variants of attention have been proposed, but all share the underlying core of these attention scores, with various approximations (Tay et al. 2022). The most important variant for this work is linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Roughly speaking, this family of methods drops the softmax by folding it into a kernel feature map, and uses associativity of matrix multiplication to rewrite $\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V=Q \\cdot\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)$. Moreover, in the important case of causal (autoregressive) attention, they show that when the causal mask is incorporated into the left-hand side as $\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V$, where $L$ is the lower-triangular 1's matrix, then the right-hand side can be expanded as a recurrence.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num. AtTn Blocks | 0 (Mamba-2) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 15 | 24 | Transformer++ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Perplexity $\\downarrow$ | 8.60 | 8.38 | 8.32 | 8.29 | 8.29 | 8.28 | $\\mathbf{8 . 2 6}$ | 8.27 | 8.28 | 8.30 | 8.34 | 8.50 | 8.68 |\n\nHybrid Models with SSD, MLP, and Attention We compare different ways that SSD can be combined with the (gated) MLP and attention layers, and evaluate at the 2.7B scale (64 layers), trained to 300B tokens on the Pile (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set, same data order):\n\n1. Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality \n\nTri Dao* ${ }^{{ }^{1}}$ and Albert $\\mathrm{Gu}^{*^{2}}$<br>${ }^{1}$ Department of Computer Science, Princeton University<br>${ }^{2}$ Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University<br>tri@tridao.me, agu@cs.cmu.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nWhile Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: selective state space models*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: integrating SSMs into Transformers*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Pierre-Luc Bacon, C. Pal, Orhan Firat, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sub layer for short-term representation of sequences and shows that the model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require modeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing to their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient SSM implementations*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient SSM implementations*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 7. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient SSM implementations*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: selective state space models*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: selective state space models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: selective state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: selective state space models*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets.

MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: integrating SSMs into Transformers*\n\n*Zhenzhang Li, Yubiao Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the era of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been extensively studied and widely used in medical image classification tasks. Unfortunately, CNN's limitations in modeling long-range dependencies result in poor classification performances. In contrast, ViTs are hampered by the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism, making them difficult to deploy in real-world settings with limited computational resources. Recent studies have shown that state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by it, we proposed MedMamba, the first Vision Mamba for generalized medical image classification. Concretely, we introduced a novel hybrid basic block named SS-Conv-SSM, which purely integrates the convolutional layers for extracting local features with the abilities of SSM to capture long-range dependencies, aiming to model medical images from different image modalities efficiently. By employing the grouped convolution strategy and channel-shuffle operation, MedMamba successfully provides fewer model parameters and a lower computational burden for efficient applications without sacrificing accuracy. We thoroughly evaluated MedMamba using 16 datasets containing ten imaging modalities and 411,007 images. Experimental results show that MedMamba demonstrates competitive performance on most tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This work aims to explore the potential of Vision Mamba and establish a new baseline for medical image classification, thereby providing valuable insights for developing more powerful Mamba-based artificial intelligence algorithms and applications in medicine.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 19 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"hybrid architecture optimization\", \"memory management ssm\", \"state transition efficiency\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. NASViT: Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Vision Transformers with Gradient Conflict aware Supernet Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Chengyue Gong, Dilin Wang, Meng Li, Xinlei Chen, Zhicheng Yan, Yuandong Tian, Qiang Liu, Vikas Chandra*\n\n**TL;DR:** A discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing accurate and ef\ufb01cient vision transformers (ViTs) is an important but challenging task. Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks.

Fast Aquatic Swimmer Optimization with Differentiable Projective Dynamics and Neural Network Hydrodynamic Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Elvis Nava, John Z.

Katzschmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A fully differentiable FSI simulator that can be used for computational co-design of ge-ometry and controls for rigid and soft bodies immersed in \ufb02uids, such as minimizing drag, maximizing speed, or maximizing ef\ufb01ciency via direct gradient-based optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Aquatic locomotion is a classic \ufb02uid-structure interaction (FSI) problem of interest to biologists and engineers. Solving the fully coupled FSI equations for incompressible Navier-Stokes and \ufb01nite elasticity is computationally expensive. Optimizing robotic swimmer design within such a system generally involves cumbersome, gradient-free pro-cedures on top of the already costly simulation. To address this challenge we present a novel, fully differentiable hybrid approach to FSI that com-bines a 2D direct numerical simulation for the deformable solid structure of the swimmer and a physics-constrained neural network surrogate to capture hydrodynamic effects of the \ufb02uid. For the deformable simulation of the swimmer\u2019s body, we use state-of-the-art techniques from the \ufb01eld of computer graphics to speed up the \ufb01nite-element method (FEM). For the \ufb02uid simulation, we use a U-Net architecture trained with a physics-based loss function to predict the \ufb02ow \ufb01eld at each time step. The pressure and velocity \ufb01eld outputs from the neural network are sampled around the boundary of our swimmer using an immersed boundary method (IBM) to compute its swimming motion accurately and ef\ufb01ciently. We demonstrate the computational ef\ufb01ciency and differentiability of our hybrid simulator on a 2D carangiform swimmer. Since both the solid simulator and the hydrodynamics model are automatically differentiable, we obtain a fully differentiable FSI simulator that can be used for computational co-design of ge-ometry and controls for rigid and soft bodies immersed in \ufb02uids, such as minimizing drag, maximizing speed, or maximizing ef\ufb01ciency via direct gradient-based optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Neural Architecture Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Renqian Luo, Fei Tian, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that the architecture discovered by this simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic neural architecture design has shown its potential in discovering powerful neural network architectures. Existing methods, no matter based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture search in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture optimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach: (1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous space. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as input and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation of a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the encoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better accuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder. Experiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources. Specifically we obtain $2.11\\%$ test set error rate for CIFAR-10 image classification task and $56.0$ test set perplexity of PTB language modeling task. The best discovered architectures on both tasks are successfully transferred to other tasks such as CIFAR-100 and WikiText-2. Furthermore, combined with the recent proposed weight sharing mechanism, we discover powerful architecture on CIFAR-10 (with error rate $3.53\\%$) and on PTB (with test set perplexity $56.6$), with very limited computational resources (less than $10$ GPU hours) for both tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 610  (*Influential: 101*)\n\n#### 4. RMM: Reinforced Memory Management for Class-Incremental Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management ssm\"*\n\n*Yaoyao Liu, B. Schiele, Qianru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) [40] trains classi\ufb01ers under a strict memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data of the 0 -th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each speci\ufb01c class. In essence, it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets by 3 . 6% , 4 . 4% , and 1 . 9% in the 25 -Phase settings of the above benchmarks, respectively.

However, previous literature does not deal with cases where the memorized information is outdated, which may cause confusion in later conversations. To address this issue, we present a novel task and a corresponding dataset of memory management in long-term conversations, in which bots keep track of and bring up the latest information about users while conversing through multiple sessions. In order to support more precise and interpretable memory, we represent memory as unstructured text descriptions of key information and propose a new mechanism of memory management that selectively eliminates invalidated or redundant information. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the baselines that leave the stored memory unchanged in terms of engagingness and humanness, with larger performance gap especially in the later sessions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management ssm\"*\n\n*Biqing Qi, Junqi Gao, Kaiyan Zhang, Dong Li, Jianxing Liu, Ligang Wu, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data, enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist. Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Represent to Control Partially Observed Systems: Representation Learning with Provable Sample Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: \"state transition efficiency\"*\n\n*Lingxiao Wang, Qi Cai, Zhuoran Yang, Zhaoran Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** RTC is the first sample-efficient algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces and attains an O(1/\u03b5) sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) faces two challenges. (i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP. To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Represent to Control (RTC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy. (i) For each step, RTC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across multiple steps, RTC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, RTC attains an O(1/\u03b5) sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here \u03b5 is the optimality gap. To our best knowledge, RTC is the first sample-efficient algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

An ideal transition-based model should encode these structures completely and efficiently. Previous works relying on templates or neural network structures either only encode partial structure information or suffer from computation efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel attention-based encoder unifying representation of all structures in a transition system. Specifically, we separate two views of items on structures, namely structure-invariant view and structure-dependent view. With the help of parallel-friendly attention network, we are able to encoding transition states with O(1) additional complexity (with respect to basic feature extractors). Experiments on the PTB and UD show that our proposed method significantly improves the test speed and achieves the best transition-based model, and is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. ResShift: Efficient Diffusion Model for Image Super-resolution by Residual Shifting\n\n*From Search Query: \"state transition efficiency\"*\n\n*Zongsheng Yue, Jianyi Wang, Chen Change Loy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel and efficient diffusion model for SR that significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps, thereby eliminating the need for post-acceleration during inference and its associated performance deterioration.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) methods are mainly limited by the low inference speed due to the requirements of hundreds or even thousands of sampling steps. Existing acceleration sampling techniques inevitably sacrifice performance to some extent, leading to over-blurry SR results. To address this issue, we propose a novel and efficient diffusion model for SR that significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps, thereby eliminating the need for post-acceleration during inference and its associated performance deterioration. Our method constructs a Markov chain that transfers between the high-resolution image and the low-resolution image by shifting the residual between them, substantially improving the transition efficiency. Additionally, an elaborate noise schedule is developed to flexibly control the shifting speed and the noise strength during the diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtains superior or at least comparable performance to current state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, even only with 15 sampling steps.

Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management ssm\"*\n\n*Zheng Zhan, Yushu Wu, Zhenglun Kong, Changdi Yang, Yifan Gong, Xuan Shen, Xue Lin, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs) have attracted significant\ninterest, particularly in models optimized for parallel training and handling\nlong-range dependencies. Architectures like Mamba have scaled to billions of\nparameters with selective SSM. To facilitate broader applications using Mamba,\nexploring its efficiency is crucial. While token reduction techniques offer a\nstraightforward post-training strategy, we find that applying existing methods\ndirectly to SSMs leads to substantial performance drops. Through insightful\nanalysis, we identify the reasons for this failure and the limitations of\ncurrent techniques. In response, we propose a tailored, unified post-training\ntoken reduction method for SSMs. Our approach integrates token importance and\nsimilarity, thus taking advantage of both pruning and merging, to devise a\nfine-grained intra-layer token reduction strategy. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method improves the average accuracy by 5.7% to 13.1% on six\nbenchmarks with Mamba-2 compared to existing methods, while significantly\nreducing computational demands and memory requirements.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-16T00:06:13Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-16T00:06:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management ssm\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Stack-Pointer Networks for Dependency Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: \"state transition efficiency\"*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Zecong Hu, Jingzhou Liu, Nanyun Peng, Graham Neubig, Eduard Hovy*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a novel architecture for dependency parsing: \\emph{stack-pointer\nnetworks} (\\textbf{\\textsc{StackPtr}}). Combining pointer\nnetworks~\\citep{vinyals2015pointer} with an internal stack, the proposed model\nfirst reads and encodes the whole sentence, then builds the dependency tree\ntop-down (from root-to-leaf) in a depth-first fashion. The stack tracks the\nstatus of the depth-first search and the pointer networks select one child for\nthe word at the top of the stack at each step. The \\textsc{StackPtr} parser\nbenefits from the information of the whole sentence and all previously derived\nsubtree structures, and removes the left-to-right restriction in classical\ntransition-based parsers. Yet, the number of steps for building any (including\nnon-projective) parse tree is linear in the length of the sentence just as\nother transition-based parsers, yielding an efficient decoding algorithm with\n$O(n^2)$ time complexity. We evaluate our model on 29 treebanks spanning 20\nlanguages and different dependency annotation schemas, and achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance on 21 of them.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-03T02:23:28Z  (*Updated: 2018-05-03T02:23:28Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FE-GUT: Factor Graph Optimization hybrid with Extended Kalman Filter for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB Integration\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Precise positioning and navigation information has been increasingly important with the development of the consumer electronics market. Due to some deficits of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), such as susceptible to interferences, integrating of GNSS with additional alternative sensors is a promising approach to overcome the performance limitations of GNSS-based localization systems. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) can be used to enhance GNSS in constructing an integrated localization system. However, most low-cost UWB devices lack a hardware-level time synchronization feature, which necessitates the estimation and compensation of the time-offset in the tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration. Given the flexibility of probabilistic graphical models, the time-offset can be modeled as an invariant constant in the discretization of the continuous model. This work proposes a novel architecture in which Factor Graph Optimization (FGO) is hybrid with Extend Kalman Filter (EKF) for tightly coupled GNSS/UWB integration with online Temporal calibration (FE-GUT). FGO is utilized to precisely estimate the time-offset, while EKF provides initailization for the new factors and performs time-offset compensation. Simulation-based experiments validate the integrated localization performance of FE-GUT. In a four-wheeled robot scenario, the results demonstrate that, compared to EKF, FE-GUT can improve horizontal and vertical localization accuracy by 58.59\\% and 34.80\\%, respectively, while the time-offset estimation accuracy is improved by 76.80\\%.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Efficient Structured Inference for Transition-Based Parsing with Neural Networks and Error States\n\n*From Search Query: \"state transition efficiency\"*\n\n*Ashish Vaswani, Kenji Sagae*\n\n**Abstract:** Transition-based approaches based on local classification are attractive for dependency parsing due to their simplicity and speed, despite producing results slightly below the state-of-the-art. In this paper, we propose a new approach for approximate structured inference for transition-based parsing that produces scores suitable for global scoring using local models. This is accomplished with the introduction of error states in local training, which add information about incorrect derivation paths typically left out completely in locally-trained models. Using neural networks for our local classifiers, our approach achieves 93.61{\\%} accuracy for transition-based dependency parsing in English.\n\n**Proceeding:** tacl-2016-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Prioritized Experience Replay\n\n*From Search Query: \"state transition efficiency\"*\n\n*Ioannis Antonoglou, Tom Schaul, David Silver, John Quan*\n\n**Abstract:** Experience replay lets online reinforcement learning agents remember and\nreuse experiences from the past. In prior work, experience transitions were\nuniformly sampled from a replay memory. However, this approach simply replays\ntransitions at the same frequency that they were originally experienced,\nregardless of their significance. In this paper we develop a framework for\nprioritizing experience, so as to replay important transitions more frequently,\nand therefore learn more efficiently. We use prioritized experience replay in\nDeep Q-Networks (DQN), a reinforcement learning algorithm that achieved\nhuman-level performance across many Atari games. DQN with prioritized\nexperience replay achieves a new state-of-the-art, outperforming DQN with\nuniform replay on 41 out of 49 games.\n\n**Published:** 2015-11-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hybrid architectures that combine State Space Models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Optimization Techniques for Hybrid SSM-Attention Architectures\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Papers like \"Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models\" and \"B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations\" discuss the integration of SSMs with attention mechanisms.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"selective state space models\", \"linear attention transformers\", \"hardware efficient ssm\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state space models\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state space models\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformers\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformers\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm\"*\n\n*Kevin Galim, Wonjun Kang, Yuchen Zeng, Hyung Il Koo, Kangwook Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep State Space Models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2024), have emerged\nas powerful tools for language modeling, offering high performance with\nefficient inference and linear scaling in sequence length. However, the\napplication of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to SSM-based\nmodels remains largely unexplored. This paper aims to systematically study two\nkey questions: (i) How do existing PEFT methods perform on SSM-based models?\n(ii) Which modules are most effective for fine-tuning? We conduct an empirical\nbenchmark of four basic PEFT methods on SSM-based models. Our findings reveal\nthat prompt-based methods (e.g., prefix-tuning) are no longer effective, an\nempirical result further supported by theoretical analysis. In contrast, LoRA\nremains effective for SSM-based models. We further investigate the optimal\napplication of LoRA within these models, demonstrating both theoretically and\nexperimentally that applying LoRA to linear projection matrices without\nmodifying SSM modules yields the best results, as LoRA is not effective at\ntuning SSM modules. To further improve performance, we introduce LoRA with\nSelective Dimension tuning (SDLoRA), which selectively updates certain channels\nand states on SSM modules while applying LoRA to linear projection matrices.\nExtensive experimental results show that this approach outperforms standard\nLoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-11T17:30:28Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-11T17:30:28Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state space models\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: \"selective state space models\"*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets.

Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention transformers\"*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Angelos Katharopoulos, Nikolaos Pappas, Apoorv Vyas*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design using selective state space models (SSMs), here are the key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The Mamba architecture integrates selective SSMs into a neural network without traditional attention or MLP blocks.

Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content. (Right Bottom) The Induction Heads task is an example of associative recall that requires retrieving an answer based on context, a key ability for LLMs. ```\nAlgorithm 1 SSM (S4)\nAlgorithm 2 SSM + Selection (S6)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\n    1: \\(A:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    1: \\(\\boldsymbol{A}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n\\(\\triangleright\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n                            \\(>\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n        B \\(:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    2: \\(\\boldsymbol{B}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow s_{B}(x)\\)\n        \\(C:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n        \\(\\Delta:(\\mathrm{D}) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\) (Parameter)\n        \\(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, A, B)\\)\n        \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n            \\(\\Delta\\) Time-invariant: recurrence or convolution\n    return \\(y\\)\n    3: \\(C:(B, L, N) \\leftarrow s_{C}(x)\\)\n    4: \\(\\Delta:(B, L, D) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\left(\\right.\\) Parameter \\(\\left.+s_{\\Delta}(x)\\right)\\)\n    5: \\(\\bar{A}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})\\)\n    6: \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n        \\(\\Delta\\) Time-varying: recurrence (scan) only\n    7: return \\(y\\)\n```\n\n\n### 3.3 Efficient Implementation of Selective SSMs\n\nHardware-friendly primitives such as convolutions (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) enjoy widespread application. Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference ( $5 \\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization.

Privacy Amplification for Matrix Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"state selection mechanisms\"*\n\n*Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Arun Ganesh, Thomas Steinke, Abhradeep Thakurta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes MMCC, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism, and proves that correlated outputs in MMCC can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD's success in machine learning, but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose\"MMCC\", the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as $\\epsilon\\to0$. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our\"conditional composition theorem\"has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our amplification algorithm also has practical empirical utility: we show it leads to significant improvement in the privacy-utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL algorithms on standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. DialogConv: A Lightweight Fully Convolutional Network for Multi-view Response Selection\n\n*From Search Query: \"state selection mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yongkang Liu, Shi Feng, Wei Gao, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection, exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response.\n\n**Abstract:** Current end-to-end retrieval-based dialogue systems are mainly based on Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformers with attention mechanisms. Although promising results have been achieved, these models often suffer from slow inference or huge number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection. DialogConv is exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response. Dialogues are modeled in 3D views, where DialogConv performs convolution operations on embedding view, word view and utterance view to capture richer semantic information from multiple contextual views. On the four benchmark datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, DialogConv is on average about 8.5x smaller in size, and 79.39x and 10.64x faster on CPU and GPU devices, respectively. At the same time, DialogConv achieves the competitive effectiveness of response selection.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Change is Hard: A Closer Look at Subpopulation Shift\n\n*From Search Query: \"state selection mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yuzhe Yang, Haoran Zhang, D. Katabi, M. Ghassemi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in subgroups is proposed, and a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains is established.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models often perform poorly on subgroups that are underrepresented in the training data. Yet, little is understood on the variation in mechanisms that cause subpopulation shifts, and how algorithms generalize across such diverse shifts at scale. In this work, we provide a fine-grained analysis of subpopulation shift. We first propose a unified framework that dissects and explains common shifts in subgroups. We then establish a comprehensive benchmark of 20 state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on 12 real-world datasets in vision, language, and healthcare domains. With results obtained from training over 10,000 models, we reveal intriguing observations for future progress in this space. First, existing algorithms only improve subgroup robustness over certain types of shifts but not others. Moreover, while current algorithms rely on group-annotated validation data for model selection, we find that a simple selection criterion based on worst-class accuracy is surprisingly effective even without any group information. Finally, unlike existing works that solely aim to improve worst-group accuracy (WGA), we demonstrate the fundamental tradeoff between WGA and other important metrics, highlighting the need to carefully choose testing metrics.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization ssm\"*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

Weight decay can cause the expected magnitude and angular updates of a neuron's weight vector to converge to a steady state we call rotational equilibrium. These states can be highly homogeneous, effectively balancing the average rotation -- a proxy for the effective learning rate -- across different layers and neurons. Our work analyzes these dynamics across optimizers like Adam, Lion, and SGD with momentum, offering a new simple perspective on training that elucidates the efficacy of widely used but poorly understood methods in deep learning. We demonstrate how balanced rotation plays a key role in the effectiveness of normalization like Weight Standardization, as well as that of AdamW over Adam with L2-regularization. Finally, we show that explicitly controlling the rotation provides the benefits of weight decay while substantially reducing the need for learning rate warmup.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Scan and Snap: Understanding Training Dynamics and Token Composition in 1-layer Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"ssm training dynamics\"*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Beidi Chen, S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that self-attention acts as adiscriminative scanning algorithm: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has shown impressive performance in multiple research domains and has become the backbone of many neural network models. However, there is limited understanding on how it works. In particular, with a simple predictive loss, how the representation emerges from the gradient \\emph{training dynamics} remains a mystery. In this paper, for 1-layer transformer with one self-attention layer plus one decoder layer, we analyze its SGD training dynamics for the task of next token prediction in a mathematically rigorous manner. We open the black box of the dynamic process of how the self-attention layer combines input tokens, and reveal the nature of underlying inductive bias. More specifically, with the assumption (a) no positional encoding, (b) long input sequence, and (c) the decoder layer learns faster than the self-attention layer, we prove that self-attention acts as a \\emph{discriminative scanning algorithm}: starting from uniform attention, it gradually attends more to distinct key tokens for a specific next token to be predicted, and pays less attention to common key tokens that occur across different next tokens. Among distinct tokens, it progressively drops attention weights, following the order of low to high co-occurrence between the key and the query token in the training set. Interestingly, this procedure does not lead to winner-takes-all, but decelerates due to a \\emph{phase transition} that is controllable by the learning rates of the two layers, leaving (almost) fixed token combination.

Grokking as the Transition from Lazy to Rich Training Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"ssm training dynamics\"*\n\n*Tanishq Kumar, Blake Bordelon, S. Gershman, C. Pehlevan*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evidence is concluded that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose that the grokking phenomenon, where the train loss of a neural network decreases much earlier than its test loss, can arise due to a neural network transitioning from lazy training dynamics to a rich, feature learning regime. To illustrate this mechanism, we study the simple setting of vanilla gradient descent on a polynomial regression problem with a two layer neural network which exhibits grokking without regularization in a way that cannot be explained by existing theories. We identify sufficient statistics for the test loss of such a network, and tracking these over training reveals that grokking arises in this setting when the network first attempts to fit a kernel regression solution with its initial features, followed by late-time feature learning where a generalizing solution is identified after train loss is already low. We find that the key determinants of grokking are the rate of feature learning -- which can be controlled precisely by parameters that scale the network output -- and the alignment of the initial features with the target function $y(x)$. We argue this delayed generalization arises when (1) the top eigenvectors of the initial neural tangent kernel and the task labels $y(x)$ are misaligned, but (2) the dataset size is large enough so that it is possible for the network to generalize eventually, but not so large that train loss perfectly tracks test loss at all epochs, and (3) the network begins training in the lazy regime so does not learn features immediately. We conclude with evidence that this transition from lazy (linear model) to rich training (feature learning) can control grokking in more general settings, like on MNIST, one-layer Transformers, and student-teacher networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample\nimplementation of Samba is publicly available in\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T17:50:51Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization ssm\"*\n\n*Zheng Zhan, Yushu Wu, Zhenglun Kong, Changdi Yang, Yifan Gong, Xuan Shen, Xue Lin, Pu Zhao, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs) have attracted significant\ninterest, particularly in models optimized for parallel training and handling\nlong-range dependencies. Architectures like Mamba have scaled to billions of\nparameters with selective SSM. To facilitate broader applications using Mamba,\nexploring its efficiency is crucial. While token reduction techniques offer a\nstraightforward post-training strategy, we find that applying existing methods\ndirectly to SSMs leads to substantial performance drops. Through insightful\nanalysis, we identify the reasons for this failure and the limitations of\ncurrent techniques. In response, we propose a tailored, unified post-training\ntoken reduction method for SSMs. Our approach integrates token importance and\nsimilarity, thus taking advantage of both pruning and merging, to devise a\nfine-grained intra-layer token reduction strategy. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method improves the average accuracy by 5.7% to 13.1% on six\nbenchmarks with Mamba-2 compared to existing methods, while significantly\nreducing computational demands and memory requirements.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-16T00:06:13Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-16T00:06:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language\n  Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization ssm\"*\n\n*Yash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, Michael Hahn*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have\nshown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with\ntransformers. However, there is little understanding of the in-principle\nabilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for\nbetter LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the\ncapacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional\nRNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct\nstrengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and\nexact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly.\nThey can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even\nwithout simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in\ncurrent SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for\nSSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-27T17:46:57Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-02T19:43:55Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"ssm training dynamics\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Large-Scale Image Retrieval with Attentive Deep Local Features\n\n*From Search Query: \"state selection mechanisms\"*\n\n*Hyeonwoo Noh, Jack Sim, Bohyung Han, Andre Araujo, Tobias Weyand*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an attentive local feature descriptor suitable for large-scale\nimage retrieval, referred to as DELF (DEep Local Feature). The new feature is\nbased on convolutional neural networks, which are trained only with image-level\nannotations on a landmark image dataset. To identify semantically useful local\nfeatures for image retrieval, we also propose an attention mechanism for\nkeypoint selection, which shares most network layers with the descriptor. This\nframework can be used for image retrieval as a drop-in replacement for other\nkeypoint detectors and descriptors, enabling more accurate feature matching and\ngeometric verification. Our system produces reliable confidence scores to\nreject false positives---in particular, it is robust against queries that have\nno correct match in the database. To evaluate the proposed descriptor, we\nintroduce a new large-scale dataset, referred to as Google-Landmarks dataset,\nwhich involves challenges in both database and query such as background\nclutter, partial occlusion, multiple landmarks, objects in variable scales,\netc. We show that DELF outperforms the state-of-the-art global and local\ndescriptors in the large-scale setting by significant margins.

OxKBC: Outcome Explanation for Factorization Based Knowledge Base Completion\n\n*From Search Query: \"state selection mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mausam, Parag Singla, Mayank Singh Chauhan, Aman Agrawal, Ankesh Gupta, Yatin Nandwani*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models for Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) are based on tensor factorization (TF), e.g, DistMult, ComplEx. While they produce good results, they cannot expose any rationale behind their predictions, potentially reducing the trust of a user in the model. Previous works have explored creating an inherently explainable model, e.g. Neural Theorem Proving (NTP), DeepPath, MINERVA, but explainability comes at the cost of performance. Others have tried to create an auxiliary explainable model having high fidelity with the underlying TF model, but unfortunately, they do not scale on large KBs such as FB15k and YAGO.\u00a0In this work, we propose OxKBC -- an Outcome eXplanation engine for KBC, which provides a post-hoc explanation for every triple inferred by an (uninterpretable) factorization based model. It first augments the underlying Knowledge Graph by introducing weighted edges between entities based on their similarity given by the underlying model. In the augmented graph, it defines a notion of human-understandable explanation paths along with a language to generate them. Depending on the edges, the paths are aggregated into second-order templates for further selection. The best template with its grounding is then selected by a neural selection module that is trained with minimal supervision by a novel loss function. Experiments over Mechanical Turk demonstrate that users find our explanations more trustworthy compared to rule mining.\n\n**Proceeding:** akbc-2020-6\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning with Mamba State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization ssm\"*\n\n*Nima Mesgarani, Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Siavash Shams*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various tasks, including audio representation learning, due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, they often suffer from quadratic complexity in both GPU memory usage and computational inference time, affecting their efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as a promising alternative, offering a more efficient approach by avoiding these complexities. Given these advantages, we explore the potential of SSM-based models in audio tasks. In this paper, we introduce Self-Supervised Audio Mamba (SSAMBA), the first self-supervised, attention-free, and SSM-based model for audio representation learning. SSAMBA leverages the bidirectional Mamba to capture complex audio patterns effectively. We incorporate a self-supervised pretraining framework that optimizes both discriminative and generative objectives, enabling the model to learn robust audio representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. We evaluated SSAMBA on various tasks such as audio classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. Our results demonstrate that SSAMBA outperforms the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) in most tasks. Notably, SSAMBA is approximately 92.7% faster in batch inference speed and 95.4% more memory-efficient than SSAST for the tiny model size with an input token size of 22k. These efficiency gains, combined with superior performance, underscore the effectiveness of SSAMBA's architectural innovation, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of audio processing applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization ssm\"*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range of sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks at both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on sequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence modeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat.\n\n**Conference:** sparse-modular-activation-for-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n#### 5. How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections\n\n*From Search Query: \"ssm training dynamics\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-24\n\n\n\n#### 6. Vision Mamba: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy\n\n*From Search Query: \"ssm training dynamics\"*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Chenxu Zhang, Xiao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains. Since Mamba is now on an upward trend, please actively notice us if you have new findings, and new progress on Mamba will be included in this survey in a timely manner and updated on the Mamba project at https://github.com/lx6c78/Vision-Mamba-A-Comprehensive-Survey-and-Taxonomy.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models using State-Space Models (SSMs), here are the key findings and insights from the provided sources, aligned with the specified details:\n\n## Technical Implementations of State Selection in SSMs\n- The Mamba architecture introduces a selective state-space mechanism that allows for efficient state space parameterization and selection. This is achieved through a state space duality (SSD) framework, which simplifies the matrix **A** into a scalar, enabling more efficient and selective propagation or forgetting of information.\n- Mamba incorporates a selectivity mechanism leveraging multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states, which enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and improves efficiency.\n\n## Memory Management and Optimization Techniques for SSMs\n- SSMs, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer better scalability and reduced memory usage compared to Transformers. Mamba uses zero-order hold discretization, which allows it to handle larger hidden states and longer sequences more effectively.\n- The use of structured state-space models like Mamba enables efficient handling of long sequences with lower computational complexity, which is crucial for memory optimization.\n\n## Training Stability and Convergence Analysis\n- The training dynamics of SSMs are improved through the incorporation of dynamic hidden states, which handle long-range dependencies efficiently. This is inspired by the low-complexity inference mechanism of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).\n- The theoretical foundations of deep selective state-space models provide a framework for analyzing the expressive power and stability of these models. This includes characterizing the gating mechanism as a crucial architectural choice for in-context learning and stability.\n\n## Integration Methods with Existing Architectures\n- Mamba Neural Operator (MNO) integrates the SSM framework into a unified neural operator approach, making it adaptable to diverse architectures, including any Transformer-based model. This allows for the combination of the strengths of both SSMs and Transformers.\n- The integration of SSMs with other models, such as the bidirectional modeling approach in SC-MAMBA2, demonstrates how SSMs can be adapted to specific domains (e.g., single-cell transcriptomics) while leveraging their efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Different SSM Variants\n- The comparison between Mamba and other SSM variants, such as S4, highlights Mamba's advantages in handling larger hidden states and longer sequences. Mamba's use of zero-order holds and selective state representations makes it more efficient and effective.\n- The analysis also shows that Mamba surpasses attention-powered foundation models in both accuracy and efficiency, especially at large scales of billion parameters.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies\n- Mamba's design includes hardware-optimized algorithms, which maintain robust contextual information capture while optimizing for computational efficiency. This involves block decomposition methods and exploiting the memory hierarchy, which are crucial for performance.\n- The SPikE-SSM model, which combines SSMs with spiking neural networks (SNNs), promotes sparse training and fully parallel inference, leveraging the intrinsic dynamics of SNNs for efficient long-sequence modeling.\n\nIn summary, the Mamba architecture and its variants offer significant improvements in state selection mechanisms, memory optimization, training stability, integration with existing architectures, and hardware-specific optimization strategies. These advancements make SSMs a promising alternative to traditional Transformer-based models for autoregressive language modeling.\n",

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions.

Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference ( $5 \\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

EVC: Towards Real-Time Neural Image Compression with Mask Decay\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression ssm\"*\n\n*G. Wang, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Yan Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Both mask decay and residual representation learning greatly improve the RD performance of the scalable encoder, which significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for the medium and small models, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural image compression has surpassed state-of-the-art traditional codecs (H.266/VVC) for rate-distortion (RD) performance, but suffers from large complexity and separate models for different rate-distortion trade-offs. In this paper, we propose an Efficient single-model Variable-bit-rate Codec (EVC), which is able to run at 30 FPS with 768x512 input images and still outperforms VVC for the RD performance. By further reducing both encoder and decoder complexities, our small model even achieves 30 FPS with 1920x1080 input images. To bridge the performance gap between our different capacities models, we meticulously design the mask decay, which transforms the large model's parameters into the small model automatically. And a novel sparsity regularization loss is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of $L_p$ regularization. Our algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap by 50% and 30% for our medium and small models, respectively. At last, we advocate the scalable encoder for neural image compression. The encoding complexity is dynamic to meet different latency requirements. We propose decaying the large encoder multiple times to reduce the residual representation progressively. Both mask decay and residual representation learning greatly improve the RD performance of our scalable encoder.

Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression ssm\"*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression ssm\"*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M. Larson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression, and reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of P AP perturbation.\n\n**Abstract:** Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm implementation\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm implementation\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm implementation\"*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid ssm attention\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression ssm\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview\n\n*From Search Query: \"state compression ssm\"*\n\n*Carmen Amo Alonso, Jerome Sieber, Melanie N. Zeilinger*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear\nstate-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation\nmodels. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better\nperformance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language\ntasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a\nlatent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The\nsame goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model\ndynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence\nmodeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the\ncorresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction\nto SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest\nresearch developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful\nSSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic\nperspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models,\nevaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing\na model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-25T16:10:47Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T16:10:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm implementation\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with\n  Eidetic and Fading Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ssm implementation\"*\n\n*Luca Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, Alessandro Achille, Stefano Soatto*\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by\nallowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making\nefficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such\nresources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\" in\nTransformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or\nSSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but\nwith limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to\nseamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage\nideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called\nB'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary\ncomposable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models\nthat can access short-term eidetic memory \"in-context,\" permanent structural\nmemory \"in-weights,\" fading memory \"in-state,\" and long-term eidetic memory\n\"in-storage\" by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated\nmemory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid\narchitectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic\nimplementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently\nin hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as\nassociative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a\nbaseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity\ncomparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters,\nwhile being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability\nto modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer\nsequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest\nsequences seen during training.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-08T18:41:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-08T18:41:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer\n(BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range\ncontextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term\nrepresentation of sequences. We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the\nBlock-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the\nlayer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model\nparallelization is employed.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-15T22:48:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-30T15:44:04Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications.

The quadratic self-attention mechanism effectively alleviates the shortcomings of selective state space in handling long-term dependencies of any element in the sequence. We propose a position information injection method that connects the selective state space model with the quadratic attention, and integrates these two architectures with hybrid experts with cross-sharing domains, so that we can enjoy the advantages of both. We design a new architecture with a more biomimetic idea: Observer-Thinker-Conceiver-Expresser (OTCE), which can compete with well-known medium-scale open-source language models on a small scale in language modeling tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models using State Space Models (SSMs), here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Techniques for Efficient State Compression in SSMs\n\n- The paper \"mimetic initialization helps state space models learn to recall\" highlights the importance of initialization in SSMs. It proposes a novel mimetic initialization technique that can improve the recall capabilities of SSMs by representing linear attention, which is crucial for efficient state compression.\n- The work on \"Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\" introduces a unified post-training token reduction method tailored for SSMs. This method integrates token importance and similarity, combining token pruning and merging to reduce computational demands and memory requirements while preserving performance.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Implementations of SSM Computation\n\n- The technology update on \"Low Precision and Model Optimization\" discusses several methods for optimizing SSMs, including quantization techniques.

This is crucial for understanding how to train hybrid architectures efficiently.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies for SSMs\n\n- The \"Low Precision and Model Optimization\" update details several memory optimization strategies, including KV cache quantization and salience-determined bit allocation. These methods reduce memory overhead while maintaining model accuracy, which is essential for optimizing SSMs.\n- The \"Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\" paper offers a fine-grained intra-layer token reduction strategy that balances preserving essential information and eliminating redundancy, significantly reducing memory requirements.\n\n## Efficient State Selection Mechanisms\n\n- The \"Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models\" paper proposes a hybrid token reduction strategy that evaluates the importance and similarity of tokens. This approach allows for dynamic, content-dependent state selection, which is crucial for balancing expressiveness with efficiency.\n- The analysis note emphasizes the need for dynamic, content-dependent state selection and the importance of balancing expressiveness with efficiency, which aligns with the proposed token reduction methods[Analysis Note].\n\nThese findings and techniques provide a comprehensive framework for improving autoregressive language model design using SSMs, focusing on efficient state compression, hardware-aware implementations, hybrid architectures, training dynamics, memory optimization, and efficient state selection mechanisms.\n",

While the **FastTTTLinear** GAU integrates Gated Linear Attention (GLA) to achieve linear computational complexity, it still faces limitations in capturing long-range dependencies effectively. **State Space Models (SSMs)**, particularly **Selective State Space Models**, have demonstrated superior capabilities in modeling long sequences with linear complexity. Integrating Selective SSMs into FastTTTLinear can enhance its ability to model long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency and compatibility with Test-Time Training (TTT).\n\n## **Related Work**\n\n- **Mamba** [1] introduced Selective SSMs that replace traditional attention mechanisms, achieving linear-time sequence modeling and efficient inference. Mamba demonstrated strong performance on long-sequence tasks across various modalities.\n\n- **Mamba-2** [2] refined the architecture using the **Structured State Space Duality (SSD)** framework, achieving 2-8\u00d7 speed improvements while maintaining competitive performance with Transformers.\n\n- **Structured State Space Duality (SSD)** [2] provides theoretical connections between SSMs and attention mechanisms through structured semiseparable matrices, guiding the integration of SSMs into Transformer-like architectures.\n\n- **FlashButterfly** [3] presented hardware-efficient algorithms optimizing long convolutions integral to SSM computations, improving runtime performance.\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers (GLA Transformers)** [4] introduced data-dependent gating mechanisms, enhancing the expressiveness of linear attention while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## **Problem Analysis**\n\n### **Limitations of FastTTTLinear**\n\n- **Ineffective Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: While GLA provides efficiency, it may not capture long-range dependencies as effectively as desired.\n\n- **Lack of Selectivity**: The linear attention mechanism in FastTTTLinear does not inherently possess the ability to selectively retain or discard information based on content.\n\n### **Core Concept**\n\n- **Integrate Selective State Space Models into FastTTTLinear**: By replacing or augmenting the linear attention mechanism with a Selective SSM, we aim to enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n- **Maintain Computational Efficiency**: Utilize hardware-efficient algorithms and simplified parameterizations to ensure that the integration does not compromise computational performance.\n\n- **Ensure Compatibility with TTT**: Design the integration to work seamlessly within the existing GAU framework and support test-time training capabilities.\n\n### **Mathematical Justification**\n\n- **Selective SSM Equations**:\n\n  The discrete state-space equations for a Selective SSM are:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\mathbf{h}_{t} &= \\mathbf{A}_{t} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t} \\\\\n  \\mathbf{y}_{t} &= \\mathbf{C}_{t} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\n\n  - \\(\\mathbf{A}_{t}, \\mathbf{B}_{t}, \\mathbf{C}_{t}\\) are input-dependent state matrices, allowing the model to selectively retain or discard information.\n\n- **Efficiency through Parallelism**:\n\n  - Implementing the computation using parallel scan algorithms enables efficient processing despite the recurrent nature of SSMs.\n\n- **Theoretical Connections via SSD Framework**:\n\n  - The SSD framework shows that SSMs and attention mechanisms can be connected through structured semiseparable matrices.\n\n## **Design Plan**\n\n### **Selected GAU to Modify**\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### **Modifications and New Structures**\n\n1. **Replace Gated Linear Attention with Selective SSM Layer**:\n\n   -

**Parameterization**:\n\n     \\[\n     \\begin{aligned}\n     \\mathbf{A}_{t} &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{A} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{A}) \\\\\n     \\mathbf{B}_{t} &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{B} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{B}) \\\\\n     \\mathbf{C}_{t} &= \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{C} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{C})\n     \\end{aligned}\n     \\]\n\n     - \\(\\sigma\\) is an activation function (e.g., sigmoid).\n\n     - \\(\\mathbf{W}_{A}, \\mathbf{W}_{B}, \\mathbf{W}_{C}\\) are learnable weight matrices.\n\n3. **Efficient Computation using Hardware-Aware Algorithms**:\n\n   - Implement the Selective SSM computations using parallel scanning techniques to maintain efficiency.\n\n   - Utilize algorithms like **FlashButterfly** to optimize long convolutions.\n\n4. **Incorporate Gating Mechanisms**:\n\n   - Introduce data-dependent gates to control the flow of information dynamically.\n\n   - **Gating Function**:\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{g}_{t} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{g} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{g})\n     \\]\n\n     - Use \\(\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\) to modulate the state update:\n\n       \\[\n       \\mathbf{h}_{t} = \\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot (\\mathbf{A}_{t} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t})\n       \\]\n\n       - \\(\\odot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n5. **Connection to SSD Framework**:\n\n   - Design the Selective SSM layer to conform to the SSD framework, ensuring theoretical soundness.\n\n6. **Maintain GAU Interface and Compatibility with TTT**:\n\n   - Ensure that the modified GAU receives input \\(X\\) and outputs \\(Y\\) of the same shape.\n\n   - Preserve the GAU's structure to remain compatible with the TTT framework.\n\n### **Mathematical Formulations**\n\n- **State Update Equation**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{h}_{t} = \\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot (\\mathbf{A}_{t} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{t} \\mathbf{x}_{t})\n  \\]\n\n- **Output Equation**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{y}_{t} = \\mathbf{C}_{t} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n  \\]\n\n- **Gating Mechanism**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{g}_{t} = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_{g} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{g})\n  \\]\n\n- **Input-Dependent State Matrices**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  \\mathbf{A}_{t} &= \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_{A} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{A}) \\\\\n  \\mathbf{B}_{t} &= \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_{B} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{B}) \\\\\n  \\mathbf{C}_{t} &= \\tanh(\\mathbf{W}_{C} \\mathbf{x}_{t} + \\mathbf{b}_{C})\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\n\n### **Theoretical Justifications**\n\n- **Enhanced Long-Range Dependency Modeling**:\n\n  - The Selective SSM can capture dependencies over long sequences due to its recurrent structure and ability to retain information indefinitely.\n\n- **Selective Information Processing**:\n\n  - Input-dependent state parameters allow the model to focus on relevant information and ignore irrelevant inputs dynamically.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency**:\n\n  - By using hardware-aware parallel algorithms, the model maintains linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length.\n\n- **Compatibility with GAU Framework**:\n\n  - Modifications are localized within the FastTTTLinear GAU, preserving the overall model architecture and facilitating integration.\n\n## **Implementation Guidelines**\n\n### **Pseudo-code for Modified FastTTTLinear**\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom model_discovery.model.utils.modules import GAUBase\n\nclass SelectiveSSMFastTTTLinear(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    Selective State-Space Model integrated into FastTTTLinear GAU.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, state_dim=None, device=None, dtype=None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.state_dim = state_dim if state_dim is not None else embed_dim\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        \n        # Input projection\n        self.input_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # State matrices parameterized by input\n        self.W_A = nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.state_dim * self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_B = nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.state_dim * self.embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_C = nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.embed_dim * self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Gating mechanism\n        self.W_g = nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Initial hidden state\n        self.h_0 = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        \n        # Activation functions\n        self.activation = nn.Tanh()\n        self.gate_activation = nn.Sigmoid()\n        \n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # X shape: (B, L, D)\n        B, L, D = X.size()\n        H = self.state_dim\n        \n        # Initialize hidden states\n        h_t = self.h_0.expand(B, H)  # Shape: (B, H)\n        \n        outputs = []\n        \n        for t in range(L):\n            x_t = X[:, t, :]  # Shape: (B, D)\n            \n            # Compute state matrices\n            A_t = self.activation(self.W_A(x_t)).view(B, H, H)  # Shape: (B, H, H)\n            B_t = self.activation(self.W_B(x_t)).view(B, H, D)  # Shape: (B, H, D)\n            C_t = self.activation(self.W_C(x_t)).view(B, D, H)  # Shape: (B, D, H)\n            \n            # Compute gate\n            g_t = self.gate_activation(self.W_g(x_t))  # Shape: (B, H)\n            \n            # State update\n            h_tilde = torch.bmm(A_t, h_t.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1) + torch.bmm(B_t, x_t.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1)\n            h_t = g_t * h_tilde + (1 -

Initialize the hidden state parameter `h_0`.\n\n3. **Forward Pass Computation**:\n\n   - For each timestep \\(t\\), perform the following:\n\n     - Compute input-dependent state matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}_{t}, \\mathbf{B}_{t}, \\mathbf{C}_{t}\\).\n\n     - Compute gating vector \\(\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\).\n\n     - Update the hidden state \\(\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\) using the gated recurrence.\n\n     - Compute the output \\(\\mathbf{y}_{t}\\) using \\(\\mathbf{C}_{t}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{h}_{t}\\).\n\n   - Collect all outputs to form the output sequence \\(Y\\).\n\n4. **Optimize Computation**:\n\n   - Implement parallel computations where possible to leverage GPU acceleration.\n\n   - Utilize efficient batch operations instead of explicit loops if hardware allows.\n\n5. **Integrate into Model**:\n\n   -

The recurrent nature of SSMs can be a computational bottleneck.\n\n  - Implement scan operations to parallelize the recurrence across the sequence length.\n\n  - Consider approximations or simplifications that allow for efficient computation without significant loss of performance.\n\n- **Numerical Stability**:\n\n  - Careful choice of activation functions (e.g., `tanh` and `sigmoid`) helps maintain numerical stability.\n\n  - Monitor gradients during training to identify potential instability.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nIntegrating a Selective State-Space Model into the FastTTTLinear GAU enhances its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently. By allowing state parameters to be input-dependent and incorporating gating mechanisms, the modified GAU can selectively retain or discard information, addressing limitations in long-sequence modeling. The approach maintains computational efficiency through hardware-aware implementations and preserves compatibility with the GAU framework and TTT. This modification is expected to improve perplexity on language modeling tasks, increase accuracy on downstream tasks, enhance robustness to varied inputs, and maintain efficiency in training and inference.\n\n## **References**\n\n1. **Gu, A., & Dao, T.
