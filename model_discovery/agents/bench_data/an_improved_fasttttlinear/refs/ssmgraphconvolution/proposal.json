(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Graph Homomorphism Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Hoang NT, Takanori Maehara*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that graph homomorphism numbers provide a natural invariant (isomorphism invariant and $\\mathcal{F}$-invariant) embedding maps which can be used for graph classification.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the graph classification problem from the graph homomorphism perspective. We consider the homomorphisms from $F$ to $G$, where $G$ is a graph of interest (e.g. molecules or social networks) and $F$ belongs to some family of graphs (e.g. paths or non-isomorphic trees). We show that graph homomorphism numbers provide a natural invariant (isomorphism invariant and $\\mathcal{F}$-invariant) embedding maps which can be used for graph classification. Viewing the expressive power of a graph classifier by the $\\mathcal{F}$-indistinguishable concept, we prove the universality property of graph homomorphism vectors in approximating $\\mathcal{F}$-invariant functions. In practice, by choosing $\\mathcal{F}$ whose elements have bounded tree-width, we show that the homomorphism method is efficient compared with other methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. Characterizing the Influence of Graph Elements\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Zizhang Chen, Peizhao Li, Hongfu Liu, Pengyu Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The influence function of an SGC model could be used to estimate the impact of removing training nodes/edges on the test performance of the SGC without re-training the model and it was demonstrated how to use influence functions to guide the adversarial attacks on GCNs effectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Influence function, a method from robust statistics, measures the changes of model parameters or some functions about model parameters concerning the removal or modification of training instances. It is an efficient and useful post-hoc method for studying the interpretability of machine learning models without the need for expensive model re-training. Recently, graph convolution networks (GCNs), which operate on graph data, have attracted a great deal of attention. However, there is no preceding research on the influence functions of GCNs to shed light on the effects of removing training nodes/edges from an input graph. Since the nodes/edges in a graph are interdependent in GCNs, it is challenging to derive influence functions for GCNs. To fill this gap, we started with the simple graph convolution (SGC) model that operates on an attributed graph and formulated an influence function to approximate the changes in model parameters when a node or an edge is removed from an attributed graph. Moreover, we theoretically analyzed the error bound of the estimated influence of removing an edge. We experimentally validated the accuracy and effectiveness of our influence estimation function. In addition, we showed that the influence function of an SGC model could be used to estimate the impact of removing training nodes/edges on the test performance of the SGC without re-training the model. Finally, we demonstrated how to use influence functions to guide the adversarial attacks on GCNs effectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Dissecting the Diffusion Process in Linear Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Yifei Wang, Yisen Wang, Jiansheng Yang, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper dissects the feature propagation steps of linear GCNs from a perspective of continuous graph diffusion, and proposes Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) that decouples the terminal time and the feature propagate steps, making it more flexible and capable of exploiting a very large number of feature propagation Steps.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have attracted more and more attentions in recent years. A typical GCN layer consists of a linear feature propagation step and a nonlinear transformation step. Recent works show that a linear GCN can achieve comparable performance to the original non-linear GCN while being much more computationally efficient. In this paper, we dissect the feature propagation steps of linear GCNs from a perspective of continuous graph diffusion, and analyze why linear GCNs fail to benefit from more propagation steps. Following that, we propose Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) that decouples the terminal time and the feature propagation steps, making it more flexible and capable of exploiting a very large number of feature propagation steps. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DGC improves linear GCNs by a large margin and makes them competitive with many modern variants of non-linear GCNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4.

StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: state space language models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 7.

We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Text classification optimization algorithm based on graph neural network\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Erdi Gao, Haowei Yang, Dan Sun, Haohao Xia, Yuhan Ma, Yuanjing Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** In the field of natural language processing, text classification, as a basic\ntask, has important research value and application prospects. Traditional text\nclassification methods usually rely on feature representations such as the bag\nof words model or TF-IDF, which overlook the semantic connections between words\nand make it challenging to grasp the deep structural details of the text.\nRecently, GNNs have proven to be a valuable asset for text classification\ntasks, thanks to their capability to handle non-Euclidean data efficiently.\nHowever, the existing text classification methods based on GNN still face\nchallenges such as complex graph structure construction and high cost of model\ntraining. This paper introduces a text classification optimization algorithm\nutilizing graph neural networks. By introducing adaptive graph construction\nstrategy and efficient graph convolution operation, the accuracy and efficiency\nof text classification are effectively improved. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method surpasses traditional approaches and\nexisting GNN models across multiple public datasets, highlighting its superior\nperformance and feasibility for text classification tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-09T23:25:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T23:25:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Taipan: Efficient and Expressive State Space Language Models with\n  Selective Attention\n\n*From Search Query: state space language models*\n\n*Chien Van Nguyen, Huy Huu Nguyen, Thang M. Pham, Ruiyi Zhang, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Puneet Mathur, Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Viet Dac Lai, Franck Dernoncourt, Thien Huu Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient long-context language modeling remains a significant challenge in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP). While Transformers dominate language tasks,\nthey struggle with long sequences due to quadratic computational complexity in\ntraining and linearly scaling memory costs during inference. Recent State Space\nModels (SSMs) such as Mamba offer alternatives with constant memory usage, but\nthey underperform in tasks requiring extensive in-context retrieval. We\nintroduce Taipan, a novel hybrid architecture that combines Mamba-2 with\nSelective Attention Layers (SALs). These SALs identify tokens requiring\nlong-range interactions, remove less important features, and then augment their\nrepresentations using the attention module. This approach balances Mamba's\nefficiency with Transformer-like performance in memory-intensive tasks. By\nconstraining the attention budget, Taipan extends accurate predictions to\ncontext lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational\nefficiency. Our experiments demonstrate Taipan's superior performance across\nvarious scales and tasks, offering a promising solution for efficient\nlong-context language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-24T09:25:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-24T09:25:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Wei-Lin Chiang, Yang Li, Si Si, Samy Bengio, Xuanqing Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

Spherical Kernel for Efficient Graph Convolution on 3D Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: efficient graph convolution*\n\n*Huan Lei, Ajmal Mian, Naveed Akhtar*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a spherical kernel for efficient graph convolution of 3D point clouds. Our metric-based kernels systematically quantize the local 3D space to identify distinctive geometric relationships in the data. Similar to the regular grid CNN kernels, the spherical kernel maintains translation-invariance and asymmetry properties, where the former guarantees weight sharing among similar local structures in the data and the latter facilitates fine geometric learning. The proposed kernel is applied to graph neural networks without edge-dependent filter generation, making it computationally attractive for large point clouds. In our graph networks, each vertex is associated with a single point location and edges connect the neighborhood points within a defined range. The graph gets coarsened in the network with farthest point sampling. Analogous to the standard CNNs, we define pooling and unpooling operations for our network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed spherical kernel with graph neural networks for point cloud classification and semantic segmentation using ModelNet, ShapeNet, RueMonge2014, ScanNet and S3DIS datasets.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space language models*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space language models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Armin W. Thomas, Khaled K. Saab, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 6. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher enhance the `GraphConvolution` GAU in an autoregressive language model by incorporating efficient graph convolution techniques, state space models, or linear attention mechanisms, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Incorporating Efficient Graph Convolution Techniques\n\n- **Simplification of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs):**\n  - The work by Wu et al. on simplifying GCNs suggests that much of the power of GCNs comes from their ability to propagate signals through networks of nodes.

In this work we focus on autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and ArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code ${ }^{1}$ and pre-trained model checkpoints ${ }^{2}$ are publicly available. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Attention Mechanism\n\nSuppose the input to the layer is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the embedding dimension, then the attention mechanism outputs\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$. Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. To facilitate modeling discrete data, the model in Eq. 2 can be discretized (using the bilinear method) by a step size $\\Delta$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1}(\\mathbf{I}+\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\\\\n& \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\Delta \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe unroll the above recurrent representation, after which we have\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\cdots+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as a convolutional representation $y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u$, where the convolution kernel\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\cdots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" is the discrete convolution operator, $u$ represents the input sequence $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, and $y$ represents the corresponding output sequence $\\left(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{L}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 2 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space graph neural networks, efficient linear attention in language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks.

Existing analyses relate this notion to the graph isomorphism problem, which is mostly relevant for graphs of small sizes, or studied graph classification or regression tasks, while prediction tasks on nodes are far more relevant on large graphs. Recently, several works showed that, on very general random graphs models, GNNs converge to certains functions as the number of nodes grows. In this paper, we provide a more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples. We emphasize the role of input node features, and study the impact of node Positional Encodings (PEs), a recent line of work that has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in practice. Through the study of several examples of PEs on large random graphs, we extend previously known universality results to significantly more general models.

Efficiently predicting high resolution mass spectra with graph neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space graph neural networks*\n\n*M. Murphy, S. Jegelka, E. Fraenkel, T. Kind, D. Healey, T. Butler*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work discovers that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas, which enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and orders- of-magnitude faster runtime than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Identifying a small molecule from its mass spectrum is the primary open problem in computational metabolomics. This is typically cast as information retrieval: an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over molecular formulas. We discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and orders-of-magnitude faster runtime than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient linear attention in language models*\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

Modeling Context With Linear Attention for Scalable Document-Level Translation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient linear attention in language models*\n\n*Zhaofeng Wu, Hao Peng, Nikolaos Pappas, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the efficacy of a recent linear attention model on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias and shows that sentential gating further improves translation quality on IWSLT.\n\n**Abstract:** Document-level machine translation leverages inter-sentence dependencies to produce more coherent and consistent translations. However, these models, predominantly based on transformers, are difficult to scale to long documents as their attention layers have quadratic complexity in the sequence length. Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias. We evaluate the model on IWSLT 2015 and OpenSubtitles 2018 against the transformer, demonstrating substantially increased decoding speed on long sequences with similar or better BLEU scores.

Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space graph neural networks*\n\n*Tina Baykaner, Daniel L. Rubin, Christopher Lee-Messer, Khaled K. Saab, Liangqiong Qu, Jared A. Dunnmon, Siyi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate biosignals are prevalent in many medical domains, such as electroencephalography, polysomnography, and electrocardiography. Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate biosignals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between the electrodes. To address these challenges, we propose representing multivariate biosignals as time-dependent graphs and introduce GraphS4mer, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that improves performance on biosignal classification tasks by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in biosignals. Specifically, (1) we leverage the Structured State Space architecture, a state-of-the-art deep sequence model, to capture long-range temporal dependencies in biosignals and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in GraphS4mer to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data. We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks and show that GraphS4mer consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalographic signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pre-training by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnographic signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) 12-lead electrocardiogram classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 2.7 points in macro-F1 score.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. TopoFR: A Closer Look at Topology Alignment on Face Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: state space graph neural networks*\n\n*Shan Luo, Baigui Sun, Siyuan Li, Haoyu Xie, Jiankang Deng, Yang Liu, Jun Dan*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n#### 4. Small-E: Small Language Model with Linear Attention for Efficient Speech Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: efficient linear attention in language models*\n\n*Axel Roebel, Nicolas Obin, Th\u00e9odor Lemerle*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) powered by language models have showcased remarkable capabilities in achieving naturalness and zero-shot voice cloning. Notably, the decoder-only transformer is the prominent architecture in this domain. However, transformers face challenges stemming from their quadratic complexity in sequence length, impeding training on lengthy sequences and resource-constrained hardware. Moreover they lack specific inductive bias with regards to the monotonic nature of TTS alignments. In response, we propose to replace transformers with emerging recurrent architectures and introduce specialized cross-attention mechanisms for reducing repeating and skipping issues. Consequently our architecture can be efficiently trained on long samples and achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot voice cloning against baselines of comparable size.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(2020b)). The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3. Performance of pixel-level classification on the sCIFAR. | Model | Accuracy (\\%) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Attention: |  |\n| Transformer (Trinh et al., 2018) | 62.20 |\n| $R N N:$ |  |\n| LSTM (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) | 63.01 |\n| r-LSTM (Trinh et al., 2018) | 72.20 |\n| UR-GRU (Gu et al., 2020b) | 74.40 |\n| HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020a) | 61.10 |\n| LipschitzRNN (Erichson et al., 2020) | 64.20 |\n| State Space Models: |  |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2022) | 91.80 |\n| S4D (Gu et al., 2022) | 90.69 |\n| S5 (Smith et al., 2023) | 90.10 |\n| Liquid-S4 (Hasani et al., 2022) | 92.02 |\n| Convolution: |  |\n| TrellisNet (Bai et al., 2018) | 73.42 |\n| CKConv (Li et al., 2022) | 63.74 |\n| FlexConv (Romero et al., 2021) | 80.82 |\n| MultiresNet (Shi et al., 2023) | $\\mathbf{9 3 . 1 5}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 2}$ |\n\nmodeling, presenting a significant challenge to models. It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information.

Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length.

Gomes, Zhixin Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism is proposed to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches to demonstrate the applicability of the theory.\n\n**Abstract:** Geometric deep learning enables the encoding of physical symmetries in modeling 3D objects. Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks. We further point out the design space for future developments of equivariant graph neural networks.

What functions can Graph Neural Networks compute on random graphs? The role of Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into graph neural networks*\n\n*Nicolas Keriven, Samuel Vaiter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks is provided, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples, and the role of input node features is emphasized.\n\n**Abstract:** We aim to deepen the theoretical understanding of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs, with a focus on their expressive power. Existing analyses relate this notion to the graph isomorphism problem, which is mostly relevant for graphs of small sizes, or studied graph classification or regression tasks, while prediction tasks on nodes are far more relevant on large graphs. Recently, several works showed that, on very general random graphs models, GNNs converge to certains functions as the number of nodes grows. In this paper, we provide a more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples. We emphasize the role of input node features, and study the impact of node Positional Encodings (PEs), a recent line of work that has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in practice. Through the study of several examples of PEs on large random graphs, we extend previously known universality results to significantly more general models. Our theoretical results hint at some normalization tricks, which is shown numerically to have a positive impact on GNN generalization on synthetic and real data. Our proofs contain new concentration inequalities of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficiently predicting high resolution mass spectra with graph neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into graph neural networks*\n\n*M. Murphy, S. Jegelka, E. Fraenkel, T. Kind, D. Healey, T. Butler*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work discovers that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas, which enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and orders- of-magnitude faster runtime than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Identifying a small molecule from its mass spectrum is the primary open problem in computational metabolomics. This is typically cast as information retrieval: an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over molecular formulas. We discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and orders-of-magnitude faster runtime than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient state space models*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient state space models*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient state space models*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into graph neural networks*\n\n*Peter W. Battaglia, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, Meire Fortunato, Tobias Pfaff*\n\n**Abstract:** Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.\n\n**Conference:** learning-mesh-based-simulation-with-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. OpenGSL: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Graph Structure Learning\n\n*From Search Query: integrating state space models into graph neural networks*\n\n*Can Wang, Chun Chen, Yan Feng, Daochen Zha, Qiaoyu Tan, Jiawei Chen, Xuanyi Zhou, Bochao Mao, Sheng Zhou, Zhiyao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for representation learning on graphs, owing to their ability to effectively integrate graph topology and node attributes. However, the inherent suboptimal nature of node connections, resulting from the complex and contingent formation process of graphs, presents significant challenges in modeling them effectively. To tackle this issue, Graph Structure Learning (GSL), a family of data-centric learning approaches, has garnered substantial attention in recent years. The core concept behind GSL is to jointly optimize the graph structure and the corresponding GNN models. Despite the proposal of numerous GSL methods, the progress in this field remains unclear due to inconsistent experimental protocols, including variations in datasets, data processing techniques, and splitting strategies. In this paper, we introduce OpenGSL, the first comprehensive benchmark for GSL, aimed at addressing this gap. OpenGSL enables a fair comparison among state-of-the-art GSL methods by evaluating them across various popular datasets using uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Through extensive experiments, we observe that existing GSL methods do not consistently outperform vanilla GNN counterparts. We also find that there is no significant correlation between the homophily of the learned structure and task performance, challenging the common belief. Moreover, we observe that the learned graph structure demonstrates a strong generalization ability across different GNN models, despite the high computational and space consumption. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid and equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Stripe: Tensor Compilation via the Nested Polyhedral Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient state space models*\n\n*Tim Zerrell, Jeremy Bruestle*\n\n**Abstract:** Hardware architectures and machine learning (ML) libraries evolve rapidly.\nTraditional compilers often fail to generate high-performance code across the\nspectrum of new hardware offerings. To mitigate, engineers develop hand-tuned\nkernels for each ML library update and hardware upgrade.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B). Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, and CNNs, and classical state space models.

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integrating SSMs into Graph Neural Networks\n\n- **Feasibility and Methodology**: Studies like Du et al. (2023) show that integrating SSMs into GNNs is feasible and can enhance the expressive power of the network. This can be done by leveraging the hierarchical nature of graphs to model temporal dynamics and long-range dependencies within graph structures.\n- **Application to GAU**: Integrating SSMs into the **GraphConvolution** GAU can enable it to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies, improving its ability to model global contextual information.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient SSM Designs\n\n- **Algorithms and Implementation**: Fu et al. (2023) introduce hardware-efficient algorithms like FlashButterfly, which optimize the runtime performance of long convolutions integral to SSMs. Using structured matrices and efficient algorithms can make the integration of SSMs computationally efficient.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Techniques like IO-aware algorithms optimize memory access patterns, crucial for handling long sequences without overwhelming hardware resources.\n\n## Compatibility with Test-Time Training (TTT)\n\n- **Stateful Computations**: SSMs involve stateful computations that need careful design to remain compatible with TTT mechanisms. Models like Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) demonstrate successful integration of SSMs with mechanisms that allow for selective state updates, which can be adapted for TTT compatibility.\n- **Dynamic Adaptation**: By exposing certain parameters of the SSM to the TTT process, the model can adjust dynamically during inference without disrupting the state evolution.\n\n## Efficient Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Alternative or Complementary**: Efficient linear attention mechanisms can replace or complement existing attention operations within the GAU. Combining SSMs with efficient linear attention, as seen in CHELA (Liu et al., 2024), can capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n- **Computational Complexity**: Linear attention reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear concerning sequence length, aiding in handling longer sequences efficiently.\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n- **Design State-Space Equations for Graph Data**: Formulate state-space equations that operate on graph-structured inputs, respecting adjacency information and capturing temporal dynamics.\n- **Optimize for Hardware Efficiency**: Use structured matrices and efficient algorithms to implement SSM computations. Exploit hardware parallelism capabilities to speed up computations.\n- **Ensure TTT Compatibility**: Design the model to expose necessary states or parameters to the TTT mechanism while maintaining the core operation of the SSM stable during test-time adaptations.\n\n### Most Useful References\n\n- **Gu, A., & Dao, T.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 70/94 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 5754-5764, 2019. [102] Z.

The majority of existing GNNs are trained in an end-to-end manner that can be viewed as tackling a bi-level optimization problem. This process is often inefficient in computation and memory usage. In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for semi-supervised learning on graphs. The proposed framework can be conveniently solved by the alternating optimization algorithms, resulting in significantly improved efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable or better performance with state-of-the-art baselines while it has significantly better computation and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Examples include \\textit{graph sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and \\textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

However, the black-box nature of GNNs prevents users from understanding and trusting the models, thus hampering their applicability. Whereas explaining GNNs remains a challenge, most existing methods fall into approximation based and perturbation based approaches with suffer from faithfulness problems and unnatural artifacts, respectively. To tackle these problems, we propose DEGREE \\degree to provide a faithful explanation for GNN predictions. By decomposing the information generation and aggregation mechanism of GNNs, DEGREE allows tracking the contributions of specific components of the input graph to the final prediction. Based on this, we further design a subgraph level interpretation algorithm to reveal complex interactions between graph nodes that are overlooked by previous methods. The efficiency of our algorithm can be further improved by utilizing GNN characteristics. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEGREE on node classification and graph classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

We propose a conformal procedure to equip GNNs with prediction sets that come with distribution-free guarantees \u2013 the output set contains the true label with arbitrarily high probability. Our post-processing procedure can wrap around any (pretrained) GNN, and unlike existing methods, results in meaningful sets even when the model provides only the top class. The key idea is to diffuse the node-wise conformity scores to incorporate neighborhood information. By leveraging the network homophily we construct sets with comparable or better efficiency (average size) and significantly improved singleton hit ratio (correct sets of size one). In addition to an extensive empirical evaluation, we investigate the theoretical conditions under which smoothing provably improves efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

Existing literature mainly focus on selecting a subgraph, through combinatorial optimization, to provide faithful explanations. However, the exponential size of candidate subgraphs limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods to large-scale GNNs. We enhance on this through a different approach: by proposing a generative structure -- GFlowNets-based GNN Explainer (GFlowExplainer), we turn the optimization problem into a step-by-step generative problem. Our GFlowExplainer aims to learn a policy that generates a distribution of subgraphs for which the probability of a subgraph is proportional to its' reward. The proposed approach eliminates the influence of node sequence and thus does not need any pre-training strategies. We also propose a new cut vertex matrix to efficiently explore parent states for GFlowNets structure, thus making our approach applicable in a large-scale setting. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, and both qualitative and quantitative results show the superiority of our GFlowExplainer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

However, the poor efficiency of GNN inference and frequent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) problem limit the successful application of GNN on edge computing platforms. To tackle these problems, a feature decomposition approach is proposed for memory efficiency optimization of GNN inference. The proposed approach could achieve outstanding optimization on various GNN models, covering a wide range of datasets, which speeds up the inference by up to 3x. Furthermore, the proposed feature decomposition could significantly reduce the peak memory usage (up to 5x in memory efficiency improvement) and mitigate OOM problems during GNN inference.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. DistDGL: Distributed Graph Neural Network Training for Billion-Scale Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: graph neural networks optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*George Karypis, Zheng Zhang, Quan Gan, Xiang Song, Qidong Su, Jinjing Zhou, Minjie Wang, Chao Ma, Da Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNN) have shown great success in learning from graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings) across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations. It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a cluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of DGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Specifically, we design an algorithm that costs\nO(sqrt(n)) memory to train a n layer network, with only the computational cost\nof an extra forward pass per mini-batch. As many of the state-of-the-art models\nhit the upper bound of the GPU memory, our algorithm allows deeper and more\ncomplex models to be explored, and helps advance the innovations in deep\nlearning research. We focus on reducing the memory cost to store the\nintermediate feature maps and gradients during training. Computation graph\nanalysis is used for automatic in-place operation and memory sharing\noptimizations. We show that it is possible to trade computation for memory -\ngiving a more memory efficient training algorithm with a little extra\ncomputation cost. In the extreme case, our analysis also shows that the memory\nconsumption can be reduced to O(log n) with as little as O(n log n) extra cost\nfor forward computation. Our experiments show that we can reduce the memory\ncost of a 1,000-layer deep residual network from 48G to 7G with only 30 percent\nadditional running time cost on ImageNet problems. Similarly, significant\nmemory cost reduction is observed in training complex recurrent neural networks\non very long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2016-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) and their optimization, memory efficiency, and hardware acceleration, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Graph Neural Network Optimization Techniques\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n- The PyGim library introduces techniques to accelerate GNNs on real Processing-In-Memory (PIM) hardware systems. This involves mapping GNN computations to PIM hardware and developing PIM-aware optimization methods to reduce data movement bottlenecks, which are significant in traditional CPU and GPU systems.\n- PyGim employs intelligent parallelization techniques, including vertex- or edge-level parallelism across cores and threads within PIM clusters, to optimize memory-intensive kernels of GNNs. This approach reduces data transfer overheads and enhances system performance.\n\n### Memory Management Strategies\n- Optimizing memory usage is crucial, as seen in the DISPEF dataset benchmark where a custom, variable-size batch sampler was implemented to ensure optimal VRAM usage during training. This strategy helps in reducing training time and improving computational efficiency.\n- PyGim also focuses on minimizing data movement between memory and processors by executing memory-intensive kernels in PIM systems, which can significantly reduce memory bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\n### Computational Optimization Methods\n- The DISPEF study highlights the importance of hyperparameter optimization, particularly the number of message-passing layers and the cutoff distance for identifying neighboring atoms, which significantly impact model accuracy and computational efficiency.\n- The use of a multiscale architecture, such as the Schake model, combines highly accurate short-range updates with more efficient long-range updates, leading to both high accuracy and reduced inference times.\n\n## Memory Efficiency in Graph Processing\n\n### Activation Compression Techniques\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss activation compression techniques, the concept of sparse neural networks can be relevant. Sparse NNs remove unnecessary parts and connections, resulting in more efficient and leaner models that require less memory and can train faster.\n\n### Memory Hierarchy Optimization\n- PyGim's approach to executing compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels in different systems (processor-centric for compute-intensive tasks and memory-centric for memory-intensive tasks) optimizes the memory hierarchy. This strategy ensures that the hardware capabilities are fully exploited, reducing memory bandwidth bottlenecks.\n\n### Cache-Efficient Algorithms\n- The optimization techniques in PyGim include load balancing schemes and parallelization strategies that reduce data transfer overheads and ensure efficient use of cache memory. This is achieved by configuring the number of PIM cores per cluster and enabling vertex- or edge-level parallelism within PIM cores.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration\n\n### Specialized Hardware for Graph Processing\n- The use of PIM systems is a key innovation for accelerating GNNs. By placing simple processors near or inside memory arrays, PIM systems alleviate the data movement bottleneck, significantly speeding up GNN computations.\n\n### Acceleration Techniques for Combined Sequential-Spatial Operations\n- PyGim's multi-level parallelization model and cooperative GNN execution strategy enable efficient handling of both compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels. This approach is particularly beneficial for combined sequential-spatial operations in GNNs.\n\n### Memory-Compute Trade-offs\n- The Schake architecture balances accuracy and computational efficiency by using different message-passing layers for short-range and long-range interactions. This design reduces inference times while maintaining high accuracy, illustrating effective memory-compute trade-offs.\n- PyGim's optimization methods also focus on balancing the execution of heterogeneous kernels to minimize data movement and optimize resource utilization, thereby achieving better memory-compute trade-offs.\n\nThese insights and techniques can be applied to improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating efficient GNN architectures, optimizing memory usage, and leveraging specialized hardware like PIM systems to enhance performance and efficiency.\n",

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DenseSSM is introduced, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, and retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Existing analyses relate this notion to the graph isomorphism problem, which is mostly relevant for graphs of small sizes, or studied graph classification or regression tasks, while prediction tasks on nodes are far more relevant on large graphs. Recently, several works showed that, on very general random graphs models, GNNs converge to certains functions as the number of nodes grows. In this paper, we provide a more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples. We emphasize the role of input node features, and study the impact of node Positional Encodings (PEs), a recent line of work that has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in practice. Through the study of several examples of PEs on large random graphs, we extend previously known universality results to significantly more general models. Our theoretical results hint at some normalization tricks, which is shown numerically to have a positive impact on GNN generalization on synthetic and real data.

The key rationale of IDGL is to learn a better graph structure based on better node embeddings, and vice versa (i.e., better node embeddings based on a better graph structure). Our iterative method dynamically stops when the learned graph approaches close enough to the graph optimized for the prediction task. In addition, we cast the graph learning problem as a similarity metric learning problem and leverage adaptive graph regularization for controlling the quality of the learned graph. Finally, combining the anchor-based approximation technique, we further propose a scalable version of IDGL, namely IDGL-ANCH, which significantly reduces the time and space complexity of IDGL without compromising the performance. Our extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that our proposed IDGL models can consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, IDGL can be more robust to adversarial graphs and cope with both transductive and inductive learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 350  (*Influential: 50*)\n\n#### 3.

Although most GNN applications assume a single type of entity and relation, many situations involve multiple types of interactions. Relational inference is the problem of inferring these interactions and learning the dynamics from observational data. We frame relational inference as a modular meta-learning problem, where neural modules are trained to be composed in different ways to solve many tasks. This meta-learning framework allows us to implicitly encode time invariance and infer relations in context of one another rather than independently, which increases inference capacity. Framing inference as the inner-loop optimization of meta-learning leads to a model-based approach that is more data-efficient and capable of estimating the state of entities that we do not observe directly, but whose existence can be inferred from their effect on observed entities. To address the large search space of graph neural network compositions, we meta-learn a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

Conversely, graph transformers allow each node to attend to all other nodes directly, but lack graph inductive bias and have to rely on ad-hoc positional encoding. In this paper, we propose a new architecture to reconcile these challenges. Our approach stems from the recent breakthroughs in long-range modeling provided by deep state-space models: for a given target node, our model aggregates other nodes by their shortest distances to the target and uses a linear RNN to encode the sequence of hop representations. The linear RNN is parameterized in a particular diagonal form for stable long-range signal propagation and is theoretically expressive enough to encode the neighborhood hierarchy. With no need for positional encoding, we empirically show that the performance of our model is comparable to or better than that of state-of-the-art graph transformers on various benchmarks, with a significantly reduced computational cost.

Alippi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a general-purpose architecture for learning graph cellular automata (GCA), in which the lattice structure is replaced by an arbitrary graph, and shows that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space.\n\n**Abstract:** Cellular automata (CA) are a class of computational models that exhibit rich dynamics emerging from the local interaction of cells arranged in a regular lattice. In this work we focus on a generalised version of typical CA, called graph cellular automata (GCA), in which the lattice structure is replaced by an arbitrary graph. In particular, we extend previous work that used convolutional neural networks to learn the transition rule of conventional CA and we use graph neural networks to learn a variety of transition rules for GCA. First, we present a general-purpose architecture for learning GCA, and we show that it can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space. Then, we test our approach on three different tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the behaviour of a group of flocking agents; 3) learning a rule that converges to a desired target state.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Modeling Multivariate Biosignals With Graph Neural Networks and Structured State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models graph neural networks*\n\n*Tina Baykaner, Daniel L. Rubin, Christopher Lee-Messer, Khaled K. Saab, Liangqiong Qu, Jared A. Dunnmon, Siyi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate biosignals are prevalent in many medical domains, such as electroencephalography, polysomnography, and electrocardiography. Modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in multivariate biosignals is challenging due to (1) long-range temporal dependencies and (2) complex spatial correlations between the electrodes. To address these challenges, we propose representing multivariate biosignals as time-dependent graphs and introduce GraphS4mer, a general graph neural network (GNN) architecture that improves performance on biosignal classification tasks by modeling spatiotemporal dependencies in biosignals. Specifically, (1) we leverage the Structured State Space architecture, a state-of-the-art deep sequence model, to capture long-range temporal dependencies in biosignals and (2) we propose a graph structure learning layer in GraphS4mer to learn dynamically evolving graph structures in the data. We evaluate our proposed model on three distinct biosignal classification tasks and show that GraphS4mer consistently improves over existing models, including (1) seizure detection from electroencephalographic signals, outperforming a previous GNN with self-supervised pre-training by 3.1 points in AUROC; (2) sleep staging from polysomnographic signals, a 4.1 points improvement in macro-F1 score compared to existing sleep staging models; and (3) 12-lead electrocardiogram classification, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 2.7 points in macro-F1 score.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. TopoFR: A Closer Look at Topology Alignment on Face Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: state space models graph neural networks*\n\n*Shan Luo, Baigui Sun, Siyuan Li, Haoyu Xie, Jiankang Deng, Yang Liu, Jun Dan*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of face recognition (FR) has undergone significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Recently, the success of unsupervised learning and graph neural networks has demonstrated the effectiveness of data structure information. Considering that the FR task can leverage large-scale training data, which intrinsically contains significant structure information, we aim to investigate how to encode such critical structure information into the latent space. As revealed from our observations, directly aligning the structure information between the input and latent spaces inevitably suffers from an overfitting problem, leading to a structure collapse phenomenon in the latent space. To address this problem, we propose TopoFR, a novel FR model that leverages a topological structure alignment strategy called PTSA and a hard sample mining strategy named SDE. Concretely, PTSA uses persistent homology to align the topological structures of the input and latent spaces, effectively preserving the structure information and improving the generalization performance of FR model. To mitigate the impact of hard samples on the latent space structure, SDE accurately identifies hard samples by automatically computing structure damage score (SDS) for each sample, and directs the model to prioritize optimizing these samples. Experimental results on popular face benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our TopoFR over the state-of-the-art methods.

Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models graph neural networks*\n\n*Peter W. Battaglia, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, Meire Fortunato, Tobias Pfaff*\n\n**Abstract:** Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.\n\n**Conference:** learning-mesh-based-simulation-with-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design by integrating state space models (SSMs) with graph neural networks (GNNs), here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models with Graph Neural Networks\n\n- The paper \"What Can We Learn from State Space Models for Machine Learning\" discusses how state space models can be integrated with graph neural networks.

MNO captures long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively, with reduced memory consumption.\n- The \"SC-MAMBA2\" model leverages state-space models for efficient single-cell analysis, demonstrating near-linear scalability concerning sequence length and preserving comparable modeling abilities to transformers.\n\n## Comparison of SSMs vs Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Computational Efficiency\n- State Space Models (SSMs) are highlighted for their efficient computation, particularly in handling long-range dependencies and continuous data, which can be more computationally efficient than full attention mechanisms in Transformers.\n\n### Memory Requirements\n- SSMs, such as those in the MNO framework, reduce memory usage compared to Transformers, making them more memory-efficient for sequence modeling tasks.\n\n### Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n- SSMs are shown to capture long-range dependencies more effectively than traditional attention mechanisms, especially in continuous domains and graph-structured data. This is due to their structured state-space design and the ability to model temporal dynamics.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Graph Neural Networks\n\n- The \"GSAN\" paper proposes a model that integrates spectral and non-spectral approaches to graph convolution, which enhances scalability and flexibility in handling diverse graph sizes and topologies. This approach is designed to be efficient and adaptable to large, dynamic graphs.\n- The use of state space models in graph neural networks, as discussed in \"What Can We Learn from State Space Models for Machine Learning,\" can lead to more hardware-efficient implementations by reducing the need for full attention mechanisms and leveraging the efficient computation of SSMs.\n\n## Techniques for Combining Sequential and Graph-Structured Processing\n\n- The \"MNO\" framework demonstrates how to combine SSMs with neural operators, which can be extended to handle both sequential and graph-structured data. This integration makes the model adaptable to diverse architectures, including those that process graph data.\n- The \"GSAN\" architecture combines selective state space modeling with graph attention mechanisms, allowing for dynamic adjustment to changing node states and effective handling of both sequential and graph-structured data.\n\nThese findings suggest that integrating state space models with graph neural networks can lead to more efficient, scalable, and robust models for handling complex data structures, which aligns well with the goals of improving autoregressive language model design. The key benefits include improved computational efficiency, reduced memory requirements, and better long-range dependency modeling.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Kronecker Attention Networks (Avg.

Use of attention operators on high-order data requires flattening of the spatial or spatial-temporal dimensions into a vector, which is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. This not only incurs excessive requirements on computational resources, but also fails to preserve structures in data. In this work, we propose to avoid flattening by assuming the data follow matrix-variate normal distributions. Based on this new view, we develop Kronecker attention operators (KAOs) that operate on high-order tensor data directly. More importantly, the proposed KAOs lead to dramatic reductions in computational resources. Experimental results show that our methods reduce the amount of required computational resources by a factor of hundreds, with larger factors for higher-dimensional and higher-order data. Results also show that networks with KAOs outperform models without attention, while achieving competitive performance as those with original attention operators.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/26 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 5203-5211.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Joint Edge-Model Sparse Learning is Provably Efficient for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient graph neural networks memory management*\n\n*Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu, Songtao Lu, Miaoyuan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error and proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexityand improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include \\textit{graph sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and \\textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. PRES: Toward Scalable Memory-Based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient graph neural networks memory management*\n\n*Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Chuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. EXACT: Scalable Graph Neural Networks Training via Extreme Activation Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient graph neural networks memory management*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Fan Yang, Li Li, Rui Chen, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch, and a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called EXACT, which for the first time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs is a fundamental challenge due to the high memory usage, which is mainly occupied by activations (e.g., node embeddings). Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of nodes retained in memory. In parallel, unlike what has been developed for other types of neural networks, training with compressed activation maps is less explored for GNNs. This extension is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to implement due to the lack of necessary tools in common graph learning packages. To un-leash the potential of this direction, we provide an optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations. Based on the implementation, we propose a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called \u201cEXACT\u201d, which for the \ufb01rst time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations. We systematically analyze the trade-off among the memory saving, time overhead, and accuracy drop. In practice, EXACT can reduce the memory footprint of activations by up to 32 \u00d7 with 0 . 2 - 0 . 5% accuracy drop and 10 - 25% time overhead across different models and datasets. We implement EXACT as an extension for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch. In practice, for Pytorch Geometric, EXACT can trim down the hardware requirement of training a three-layer full-batch GraphSAGE on ogbn-products from a 48GB GPU to a 12GB GPU.

Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient graph neural networks memory management*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Dilkina*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a new constraint programming formulation called Moccasin with only $O(n)$ integer variables, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the compute graph subject to a memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** The deployment and training of neural networks on edge computing devices pose many challenges. The low memory nature of edge devices is often one of the biggest limiting factors encountered in the deployment of large neural network models. Tensor rematerialization or recompute is a way to address high memory requirements for neural network training and inference. In this paper we consider the problem of execution time minimization of compute graphs subject to a memory budget. In particular, we develop a new constraint programming formulation called \\textsc{Moccasin} with only $O(n)$ integer variables, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the compute graph. This is a significant improvement over the works in the recent literature that propose formulations with $O(n^2)$ Boolean variables. We present numerical studies that show that our approach is up to an order of magnitude faster than recent work especially for large-scale graphs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Webb, Christopher R. Lishka, Arjun K. Bansal, Nikolay Korovaiko, Jayaram Bobba, Jason Knight*\n\n**Abstract:** The Deep Learning (DL) community sees many novel topologies published each\nyear. Achieving high performance on each new topology remains challenging, as\neach requires some level of manual effort. This issue is compounded by the\nproliferation of frameworks and hardware platforms. The current approach, which\nwe call \"direct optimization\", requires deep changes within each framework to\nimprove the training performance for each hardware backend (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs,\nASICs) and requires $\\mathcal{O}(fp)$ effort; where $f$ is the number of\nframeworks and $p$ is the number of platforms. While optimized kernels for\ndeep-learning primitives are provided via libraries like Intel Math Kernel\nLibrary for Deep Neural Networks (MKL-DNN), there are several compiler-inspired\nways in which performance can be further optimized. Building on our experience\ncreating neon (a fast deep learning library on GPUs), we developed Intel\nnGraph, a soon to be open-sourced C++ library to simplify the realization of\noptimized deep learning performance across frameworks and hardware platforms.\nInitially-supported frameworks include TensorFlow, MXNet, and Intel neon\nframework. Initial backends are Intel Architecture CPUs (CPU), the Intel(R)\nNervana Neural Network Processor(R) (NNP), and NVIDIA GPUs. Currently supported\ncompiler optimizations include efficient memory management and data layout\nabstraction. In this paper, we describe our overall architecture and its core\ncomponents. In the future, we envision extending nGraph API support to a wider\nrange of frameworks, hardware (including FPGAs and ASICs), and compiler\noptimizations (training versus inference optimizations, multi-node and\nmulti-device scaling via efficient sub-graph partitioning, and HW-specific\ncompounding of operations).\n\n**Published:** 2018-01-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. Reducing Memory Contention and I/O Congestion for Disk-based GNN Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient graph neural networks memory management*\n\n*Chundong Wang, Lei Jia, Qisheng Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) gain wide popularity. Large graphs with high-dimensional features become common and training GNNs on them is non-trivial on an ordinary machine. Given a gigantic graph, even sample-based GNN training cannot work efficiently, since it is difficult to keep the graph's entire data in memory during the training process. Leveraging a solid-state drive (SSD) or other storage devices to extend the memory space has been studied in training GNNs. Memory and I/Os are hence critical for effectual disk-based training. We find that state-of-the-art (SoTA) disk-based GNN training systems severely suffer from issues like the memory contention between a graph's topological and feature data, and severe I/O congestion upon loading data from SSD for training. We accordingly develop GNNDrive. GNNDrive 1) minimizes the memory footprint with holistic buffer management across sampling and extracting, and 2) avoids I/O congestion through a strategy of asynchronous feature extraction. It also avoids costly data preparation on the critical path and makes the most of software and hardware resources. Experiments show that GNNDrive achieves superior performance. For example, when training with the Papers100M dataset and GraphSAGE model, GNNDrive is faster than SoTA PyG+, Ginex, and MariusGNN by 16.9x, 2.6x, and 2.7x, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations, memory management, and efficient graph convolution operations, here are some key insights and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Graph Neural Networks\n\n- The paper on PyGim introduces an efficient graph neural network library designed for real Processing-In-Memory (PIM) systems. It highlights the potential of PIM systems to alleviate the data movement bottleneck in GNNs by executing memory-intensive kernels near or inside memory arrays. This approach allows for cooperative GNN execution, where compute-intensive and memory-intensive kernels are executed on processor-centric and memory-centric hardware, respectively.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques for Large-Scale Graph Processing\n\n- PyGim employs intelligent parallelization techniques for memory-intensive kernels of GNNs, which include grouping available PIM cores into clusters and designing edge- and feature-level parallelism across these clusters. This approach reduces data transfer overheads and enables load balancing schemes, which are crucial for efficient memory management in large-scale graph processing.\n\n## State Management and Caching Strategies for Graph Neural Networks\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss state management and caching strategies for GNNs, the concept of parallelism and load balancing in PyGim implies efficient state management. For instance, PyGim's parallelization techniques across PIM cores and threads help in managing the state updates efficiently by minimizing data transfer costs and ensuring high compute balance across low-power PIM cores.\n\n## Efficient Graph Convolution Operations\n\n- The PyGim library optimizes graph convolution operations by executing the compute-intensive combination (dense matrix matrix multiplications) on processor-centric systems (CPUs or GPUs) and the memory-intensive aggregation (sparse matrix matrix multiplications) on memory-centric PIM systems. This hybrid approach ensures that each type of kernel is executed on the most suitable hardware, leading to efficient graph convolution operations.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration of Graph-Structured Computations\n\n- The work on HydraGNN discusses the scalable training of predictive graph foundation models using a multi-headed graph convolutional neural network architecture. It highlights the use of multi-GPU scaling to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance on large datasets, which is relevant for hardware acceleration of graph-structured computations. The paper also notes the importance of optimizing integer operations, sorting, index selection, reductions, and scatter-gather operations, which are critical for efficient graph processing.\n\n### Additional Considerations for Autoregressive Language Models\n\n- To integrate these insights into autoregressive language models, researchers could explore:\n  - Using PIM systems or similar hardware-efficient architectures to accelerate the memory-intensive parts of the model.\n  - Implementing parallelization and load balancing strategies similar to those in PyGim to manage state updates and reduce data transfer overheads.\n  - Optimizing the model's convolutional operations by leveraging the strengths of different hardware components (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, PIM systems).\n  - Applying multi-GPU scaling techniques, as seen in HydraGNN, to achieve better performance and scalability.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware autoregressive language models.\n",

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models hardware optimization sequence processing\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give a \\textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance.

Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 268  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models hardware optimization sequence processing*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Deep Latent State Space Models for Time-Series Generation\n\n*From Search Query: state space models hardware optimization sequence processing*\n\n*Linqi Zhou, Michael Poli, Winnie Xu, Stefano Massaroli, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**TL;DR:** LS4 is proposed, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity, and sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Methods based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to build generative models of time-series. In addition to high computational overhead due to explicitly computing hidden states recurrence, existing ODE-based models fall short in learning sequence data with sharp transitions - common in many real-world systems - due to numerical challenges during optimization. In this work, we propose LS4, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity. Inspired by recent deep state space models (S4), we achieve speedups by leveraging a convolutional representation of LS4 which bypasses the explicit evaluation of hidden states. We show that LS4 significantly outperforms previous continuous-time generative models in terms of marginal distribution, classification, and prediction scores on real-world datasets in the Monash Forecasting Repository, and is capable of modeling highly stochastic data with sharp temporal transitions. LS4 sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets, while also being x100 faster than other baselines on long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning neural state-space models: do we need a state estimator?\n\n*From Search Query: state space models hardware optimization sequence processing*\n\n*Dario Piga, Manas Mejari, Marco Forgione*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, several algorithms for system identification with neural state-space models have been introduced. Most of the proposed approaches are aimed at reducing the computational complexity of the learning problem, by splitting the optimization over short sub-sequences extracted from a longer training dataset. Different sequences are then processed simultaneously within a minibatch, taking advantage of modern parallel hardware for deep learning. An issue arising in these methods is the need to assign an initial state for each of the sub-sequences, which is required to run simulations and thus to evaluate the fitting loss. In this paper, we provide insights for calibration of neural state-space training algorithms based on extensive experimentation and analyses performed on two recognized system identification benchmarks. Particular focus is given to the choice and the role of the initial state estimation. We demonstrate that advanced initial state estimation techniques are really required to achieve high performance on certain classes of dynamical systems, while for asymptotically stable ones basic procedures such as zero or random initialization already yield competitive performance.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Bayesian Optimization over Permutation Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: state space models hardware optimization sequence processing*\n\n*Dae Hyun Kim, Janardhan Rao Doppa, Syrine Belakaria, Aryan Deshwal*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing expensive to evaluate black-box functions over an input space consisting of all permutations of d objects is an important problem with many real-world applications. For example, placement of functional blocks in hardware design to optimize performance via simulations. The overall goal is to minimize the number of function evaluations to find high-performing permutations. The key challenge in solving this problem using the Bayesian optimization (BO) framework is to trade-off the complexity of statistical model and tractability of acquisition function optimization. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two algorithms for BO over Permutation Spaces (BOPS). First, BOPS-T employs Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model with Kendall kernels and a Tractable acquisition function optimization approach based on Thompson sampling to select the sequence of permutations for evaluation. Second, BOPS-H employs GP surrogate model with Mallow kernels and a Heuristic search approach to optimize expected improvement acquisition function. We theoretically analyze the performance of BOPS-T to show that their regret grows sub-linearly. Our experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that both BOPS-T and BOPS-H perform better than the state-of-the-art BO algorithm for combinatorial spaces.

This involves using a faster draft model to generate candidate tokens and a slower target model for verification, which can be optimized for hardware acceleration.\n\n### State Management Strategies\n- State management in SSMs can be optimized by making the model dynamics input-dependent, as proposed in the S6 model. This allows for selective extraction of relevant information from the context, which is crucial for managing long sequences effectively.\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementation Techniques\n- Model compilation and quantization techniques, such as those offered by Amazon SageMaker, can optimize models for specific hardware types without compromising accuracy. This includes activation-aware weight quantization (AWQ) and compilation for accelerated hardware like AWS Trainium or AWS Inferentia.\n\n### Memory Hierarchy Optimization\n- Optimizing the memory hierarchy is crucial for efficient sequence processing. Techniques like extreme activation compression, as seen in EXACT for GNNs, can be adapted for SSMs to reduce memory usage and improve computational efficiency (Analysis Note).\n\n### Computational Efficiency Improvements\n- The use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and the SDLoRA method for fine-tuning SSMs can improve computational efficiency. These methods selectively update the most important parameters, reducing the overall computational load and improving performance.\n\nIn summary, the integration of state space models with other architectures, optimized memory management, and hardware-aware implementation techniques are key areas to focus on for improving autoregressive language model design.\n\n## Additional References and Insights\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Techniques like speculative decoding and model compilation can significantly improve the performance of autoregressive models on specific hardware.\n- **Memory Management**: Efficient activation compression and memory hierarchy optimization are essential for scaling to long sequences.

This modification addresses the limitations of the standard attention mechanism in modeling long sequences and reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to sequence length. Leveraging efficient algorithms and hardware-aware implementations maintains computational efficiency and scalability. Compatibility with test-time training mechanisms is ensured by designing the integration to allow dynamic adaptations without disrupting state-space computations. This enhancement is expected to improve model performance on tasks requiring long-context understanding while maintaining efficiency.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Gu, A., & Dao, T.
