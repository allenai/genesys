Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/19 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2302.13971, 2023.

Reading Turn by Turn: Hierarchical Attention Architecture for Spoken Dialogue Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance, and empirically shows that the proposed approach outperforms standard attention baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and is more robust to lengthy and out-of-distribution test samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Comprehending multi-turn spoken conversations is an emerging research area, presenting challenges different from reading comprehension of passages due to the interactive nature of information exchange from at least two speakers. Unlike passages, where sentences are often the default semantic modeling unit, in multi-turn conversations, a turn is a topically coherent unit embodied with immediately relevant context, making it a linguistically intuitive segment for computationally modeling verbal interactions. Therefore, in this work, we propose a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance. Experiments are conducted on a multi-turn conversation dataset, where nurses inquire and discuss symptom information with patients.

Inspired by the notion of working memory, we propose a new Transformer variant named RegularGPT. With its novel combination of Weight-Sharing, Adaptive-Depth, and Sliding-Dilated-Attention, RegularGPT constructs working memory along the depth dimension, thereby enabling efficient and successful modeling of regular languages such as PARITY. We further test RegularGPT on the task of natural language length extrapolation and surprisingly find that it rediscovers the local windowed attention effect deemed necessary in prior work for length extrapolation.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. When Do Transformers Shine in RL? Decoupling Memory from Credit Assignment\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Tianwei Ni, Michel Ma, Benjamin Eysenbach, Pierre-Luc Bacon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago, however, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face two distinct challenges: learning effective representations of past and present observations, and determining how actions influence future returns. Both challenges involve modeling long-term dependencies. The Transformer architecture has been very successful to solve problems that involve long-term dependencies, including in the RL domain. However, the underlying reason for the strong performance of Transformer-based RL methods remains unclear: is it because they learn effective memory, or because they perform effective credit assignment? After introducing formal definitions of memory length and credit assignment length, we design simple configurable tasks to measure these distinct quantities. Our empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago. However, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment. In summary, our results provide an explanation for the success of Transformers in RL, while also highlighting an important area for future research and benchmark design.

Towards Better Evaluation for Dynamic Link Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Retention Strategies*\n\n*Farimah Poursafaei, Shenyang Huang, Kellin Pelrine, Reihaneh Rabbany*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs new, more stringent evaluation procedures for link prediction specific to dynamic graphs, which reflect real-world considerations, to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the prevalence of recent success in learning from static graphs, learning from time-evolving graphs remains an open challenge. In this work, we design new, more stringent evaluation procedures for link prediction specific to dynamic graphs, which reflect real-world considerations, to better compare the strengths and weaknesses of methods. First, we create two visualization techniques to understand the reoccurring patterns of edges over time and show that many edges reoccur at later time steps. Based on this observation, we propose a pure memorization baseline called EdgeBank. EdgeBank achieves surprisingly strong performance across multiple settings because easy negative edges are often used in the current evaluation setting. To evaluate against more difficult negative edges, we introduce two more challenging negative sampling strategies that improve robustness and better match real-world applications. Lastly, we introduce six new dynamic graph datasets from a diverse set of domains missing from current benchmarks, providing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

Dynamic Sampling Strategies for Multi-Task Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Retention Strategies*\n\n*Ananth Gottumukkala, Dheeru Dua, Sameer Singh, Matt Gardner*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that a simple dynamic sampling strategy, selecting instances for training proportional to the multi-task model\u2019s current performance on a dataset relative to its single task performance, gives substantive gains over prior multi- Task sampling strategies, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting that is common in multi- task learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Building general reading comprehension systems, capable of solving multiple datasets at the same time, is a recent aspirational goal in the research community. Prior work has focused on model architecture or generalization to held out datasets, and largely passed over the particulars of the multi-task learning set up. We show that a simple dynamic sampling strategy, selecting instances for training proportional to the multi-task model\u2019s current performance on a dataset relative to its single task performance, gives substantive gains over prior multi-task sampling strategies, mitigating the catastrophic forgetting that is common in multi-task learning. We also demonstrate that allowing instances of different tasks to be interleaved as much as possible between each epoch and batch has a clear benefit in multitask performance over forcing task homogeneity at the epoch or batch level. Our final model shows greatly increased performance over the best model on ORB, a recently-released multitask reading comprehension benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. TriRE: A Multi-Mechanism Learning Paradigm for Continual Knowledge Retention and Promotion\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Retention Strategies*\n\n*Preetha Vijayan, Prashant Bhat, Elahe Arani, Bahram Zonooz*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by how the brain exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, TriRE is proposed, a novel CL paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task, revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding and relearning.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning (CL) has remained a persistent challenge for deep neural networks due to catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned tasks. Several techniques such as weight regularization, experience rehearsal, and parameter isolation have been proposed to alleviate CF. Despite their relative success, these research directions have predominantly remained orthogonal and suffer from several shortcomings, while missing out on the advantages of competing strategies. On the contrary, the brain continually learns, accommodates, and transfers knowledge across tasks by simultaneously leveraging several neurophysiological processes, including neurogenesis, active forgetting, neuromodulation, metaplasticity, experience rehearsal, and context-dependent gating, rarely resulting in CF. Inspired by how the brain exploits multiple mechanisms concurrently, we propose TriRE, a novel CL paradigm that encompasses retaining the most prominent neurons for each task, revising and solidifying the extracted knowledge of current and past tasks, and actively promoting less active neurons for subsequent tasks through rewinding and relearning. Across CL settings, TriRE significantly reduces task interference and surpasses different CL approaches considered in isolation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Interpretable Structure-aware Document Encoders with Hierarchical\n  Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Khalil Mrini, Claudiu Musat, Michael Baeriswyl, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a method to create document representations that reflect their\ninternal structure. We modify Tree-LSTMs to hierarchically merge basic elements\nsuch as words and sentences into blocks of increasing complexity. Our Structure\nTree-LSTM implements a hierarchical attention mechanism over individual\ncomponents and combinations thereof. We thus emphasize the usefulness of\nTree-LSTMs for texts larger than a sentence. We show that structure-aware\nencoders can be used to improve the performance of document classification. We\ndemonstrate that our method is resilient to changes to the basic building\nblocks, as it performs well with both sentence and word embeddings. The\nStructure Tree-LSTM outperforms all the baselines on two datasets by leveraging\nstructural clues. We show our model's interpretability by visualizing how our\nmodel distributes attention inside a document. On a third dataset from the\nmedical domain, our model achieves competitive performance with the state of\nthe art. This result shows the Structure Tree-LSTM can leverage dependency\nrelations other than text structure, such as a set of reports on the same\npatient.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-26T02:54:03Z  (*Updated: 2019-10-05T05:45:39Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Fake News Detection on News-Oriented Heterogeneous Information Networks\n  through Hierarchical Graph Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Yuxiang Ren, Jiawei Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The viral spread of fake news has caused great social harm, making fake news\ndetection an urgent task. Current fake news detection methods rely heavily on\ntext information by learning the extracted news content or writing style of\ninternal knowledge. However, deliberate rumors can mask writing style,\nbypassing language models and invalidating simple text-based models. In fact,\nnews articles and other related components (such as news creators and news\ntopics) can be modeled as a heterogeneous information network (HIN for short).\nIn this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, namely\nHierarchical Graph Attention Network(HGAT), which uses a novel hierarchical\nattention mechanism to perform node representation learning in HIN, and then\ndetects fake news by classifying news article nodes. Experiments on two\nreal-world fake news datasets show that HGAT can outperform text-based models\nand other network-based models. In addition, the experiment proved the\nexpandability and generalizability of our for graph representation learning and\nother node classification related applications in heterogeneous graphs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-05T19:09:13Z  (*Updated: 2021-02-13T03:16:22Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Ali Farhadi, Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Aniruddha Kembhavi*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context\nparagraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the\nquery. Recently, attention mechanisms have been successfully extended to MC.\nTypically these methods use attention to focus on a small portion of the\ncontext and summarize it with a fixed-size vector, couple attentions\ntemporally, and/or often form a uni-directional attention. In this paper we\nintroduce the Bi-Directional Attention Flow (BIDAF) network, a multi-stage\nhierarchical process that represents the context at different levels of\ngranularity and uses bi-directional attention flow mechanism to obtain a\nquery-aware context representation without early summarization. Our\nexperimental evaluations show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art\nresults in Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) and CNN/DailyMail cloze\ntest.\n\n**Published:** 2016-11-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Hang Yang, Yubo Chen, Yantao Jia, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2018-10\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Lu Wang, Weizhu Chen, Shean Wang, Yuanzhi Li, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Phillip Wallis, Yelong Shen, Edward J. Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Conference:** lora-low-rank-adaptation-of-large-language-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 5. Multichannel Long-Term Streaming Neural Speech Enhancement for Static and Moving Speakers\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Retention Strategies*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we extend our previously proposed offline SpatialNet for long-term streaming multichannel speech enhancement in both static and moving speaker scenarios. SpatialNet exploits spatial information, such as the spatial/steering direction of speech, for discriminating between target speech and interferences, and achieved outstanding performance. The core of SpatialNet is a narrow-band self-attention module used for learning the temporal dynamic of spatial vectors. Towards long-term streaming speech enhancement, we propose to replace the offline self-attention network with online networks that have linear inference complexity w.r.t signal length and meanwhile maintain the capability of learning long-term information. Three variants are developed based on (i) masked self-attention, (ii) Retention, a self-attention variant with linear inference complexity, and (iii) Mamba, a structured-state-space-based RNN-like network. Moreover, we investigate the length extrapolation ability of different networks, namely test on signals that are much longer than training signals, and propose a short-signal training plus long-signal fine-tuning strategy, which largely improves the length extrapolation ability of the networks within limited training time. Overall, the proposed online SpatialNet achieves outstanding speech enhancement performance for long audio streams, and for both static and moving speakers.

Dynamic Snake Convolution based on Topological Geometric Constraints for Tubular Structure Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Retention Strategies*\n\n*Guanyu Yang, Yuan Zhang, Xiaoming Qi, Yuting He, Yaolei Qi*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures, such as blood vessels and roads, is crucial in various fields, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in downstream tasks. However, many factors complicate the task, including thin local structures and variable global morphologies. In this work, we note the specificity of tubular structures and use this knowledge to guide our DSCNet to simultaneously enhance perception in three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. First, we propose a dynamic snake convolution to accurately capture the features of tubular structures by adaptively focusing on slender and tortuous local structures. Subsequently, we propose a multi-view feature fusion strategy to complement the attention to features from multiple perspectives during feature fusion, ensuring the retention of important information from different global morphologies. Finally, a continuity constraint loss function, based on persistent homology, is proposed to constrain the topological continuity of the segmentation better. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that our DSCNet provides better accuracy and continuity on the tubular structure segmentation task compared with several methods. Our codes will be publicly available.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms, adaptive memory systems, and dynamic retention strategies, here are some key insights and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN):** These models are designed to capture the hierarchical structure of data, such as documents or sentences, using two levels of attention: word-level and sentence-level. This approach allows the model to weigh the importance of words within sentences and sentences within documents, enhancing the understanding of complex data structures.\n- **InterACT Model:** This model leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm joint states and visual inputs in bimanual manipulation tasks. The hierarchical attention encoder processes multi-modal inputs to capture both intra- and inter-segment dependencies, which can be adapted for LM architectures to handle multi-scale dependencies.\n- **Nova Model:** This model uses hierarchical self-attention to learn the low-information-density semantics in long sequences of assembly code. It breaks down the semantics into three parts: intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention, which can be applied to LM architectures to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Adaptive Memory Systems\n\n- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Adaptive memory systems can dynamically allocate memory resources based on input complexity. This approach can be integrated into GAUs to handle longer sequences and more complex tasks efficiently. For example, meta-learning frameworks can be used to adapt the hidden states of the model during inference, optimizing memory usage and enhancing scalability.\n- **Uncertainty-Aware Compression:** Techniques like uncertainty-aware compression can optimize memory usage by compressing less certain components of hidden states. This ensures that critical information is retained while reducing the overall memory footprint, facilitating scalability to longer contexts and larger models.\n\n### Dynamic Retention Strategies\n\n- **Gated Mechanisms:** Introducing gated mechanisms within GAUs can control the flow of information, ensuring that only relevant features are processed and retained. This selective processing enhances the model's expressiveness and robustness, particularly in handling varied and complex inputs.\n- **Selective State Spaces:** Models like Mamba use selective state spaces to dynamically retain or update parts of the hidden states based on their relevance and importance. This strategy reduces unnecessary computations and memory usage, leading to faster inference times and lower operational costs.\n\n### Scalable Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Performers:** The Performers architecture estimates full-rank attention with linear space and time complexity using the FAVOR+ mechanism. This approach can be integrated into GAUs to achieve scalable attention mechanisms without sacrificing attention quality.\n- **Group Attention:** The GroupFormer model uses a hierarchical attention transformer to extract complex features in hyperspectral image classification. This approach combines spatial and spectral information, demonstrating the effectiveness of hierarchical attention in capturing multi-scale dependencies.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks:** The HAN model and its applications in NLP tasks provide a solid foundation for integrating hierarchical attention into LM architectures.\n- **InterACT Model:** This model's use of hierarchical attention to capture inter-dependencies in bimanual manipulation tasks offers insights into how to manage multi-modal inputs and capture complex dependencies.\n- **Nova Model:** The hierarchical self-attention mechanism in Nova can be adapted to capture long-range dependencies in LM architectures, particularly in handling low-information-density semantics.\n- **Performers:** The Performers architecture provides a scalable attention mechanism that can be integrated into GAUs to achieve linear complexity without compromising on attention quality.\n- **MetaTTT:** This model's integration of meta-learning, gated mechanisms, and uncertainty-aware compression offers a comprehensive approach to enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and performance of GAUs.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Explore Hierarchical Attention Models:** Investigate recent advancements in hierarchical attention mechanisms, such as HAN and InterACT, and their potential integration into GAUs.\n- **Adaptive Memory Implementations:** Research adaptive memory systems and their applications in neural networks, focusing on dynamic memory allocation and uncertainty-aware compression.\n- **Dynamic Retention and Gating Mechanisms:** Delve into studies on dynamic retention strategies and gated information flow within neural architectures, assessing their effectiveness in controlling information flow and enhancing model expressiveness.\n- **Scalable Attention Methods:** Examine scalable attention mechanisms like Performers and their applicability within GAUs, evaluating the potential integration to achieve linear complexity without sacrificing attention quality.\n- **Meta-Learning Enhancements:** Explore meta-learning approaches that can be integrated into GAUs for dynamic adaptation of hidden states, assessing the impact on model generalization and performance across various tasks.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and integrating the insights from these references, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n",

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - Hierarchical attention, as seen in Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) and Collective Event Detection, effectively captures multi-scale dependencies by processing information at both word and higher granularities (e.g., sentences or turns). This approach enhances the model's ability to discern and prioritize important information, leading to improved classification and comprehension performance.\n  - Integrating hierarchical attention into GAUs can enable the model to maintain a structured understanding of input sequences, facilitating better handling of complex dependencies without a proportional increase in computational resources.\n\n- **Adaptive Memory Systems:**\n  - Techniques like **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) demonstrate that freezing most model weights and injecting low-rank matrices can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, leading to more efficient fine-tuning and inference. This strategy can be adapted within GAUs to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n  - **Adaptive Attention Span in Transformers** introduces a mechanism where the model learns optimal attention spans, allowing it to focus computational resources on more relevant parts of the input while ignoring less pertinent segments. This adaptability can be crucial for handling varying input complexities and lengths.\n\n- **Dynamic Retention Strategies:**\n  - Gated mechanisms, as employed in hierarchical and bias tagging networks, control the flow of information by selectively attending to important features while filtering out noise or redundant data. This selective processing not only enhances model expressiveness but also contributes to computational savings by reducing unnecessary computations.\n  - **Dynamic Snake Convolution** and **TriRE** introduce advanced retention strategies that manage information flow and state persistence based on dynamic criteria, ensuring that the model efficiently retains and processes relevant information over extended sequences.\n\n- **Scalable Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Performers** offer a linear-time approximation to the traditional quadratic attention mechanism, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Integrating such scalable attention mechanisms into GAUs can enable models to handle longer contexts and larger datasets without incurring prohibitive resource costs.\n  - **DenseMamba** and **Eagle and Finch** further explore scalable architectures by enhancing state space models with dense connections and dynamic recurrence mechanisms, balancing expressivity with efficiency.\n\n- **Length Extrapolation and Regular Reasoning:**\n  - The **A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer** and **RegularGPT** demonstrate that modifying positional embeddings and constructing working memory can empower Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. These strategies are essential for deploying models in real-world applications where input lengths can vary unpredictably.\n\n### 4. Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\nTo further refine the design of the novel GAU within the RetNet architecture, the following search plan is proposed:\n\n1. **Explore Integration of Hierarchical Attention with Adaptive Memory:**\n   - Investigate how hierarchical attention mechanisms can be synergistically combined with adaptive memory systems to enhance multi-scale dependency modeling and memory efficiency in GAUs.\n\n2. **Investigate Advanced Gated Mechanisms:**\n   - Delve deeper into gated attention and retention strategies to control information flow effectively, ensuring that GAUs process only the most relevant parts of the input dynamically.\n\n3. **Examine Scalable Attention Implementations:**\n   - Study the implementation and performance of linear-time attention mechanisms like Performers within GAUs to achieve scalability without compromising attention quality.\n\n4. **Analyze Meta-Learning Approaches for Dynamic Adaptation:**\n   - Explore meta-learning frameworks that allow GAUs to adapt their attention and memory mechanisms in real-time based on input complexity and task requirements.\n\n5. **Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation:**\n   - Identify and review empirical studies that benchmark hierarchical, adaptive, and dynamic GAUs against standard Transformer models to understand performance trade-offs and benefits.\n\n6. **Review Recent Advances in Length Extrapolation:**\n   - Investigate latest research on positional embeddings and memory construction in Transformers that enable length extrapolation, to integrate similar strategies within GAUs.\n\n### 5.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - Hierarchical attention, as seen in Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) and Collective Event Detection, effectively captures multi-scale dependencies by processing information at both word and higher granularities (e.g., sentences or turns). This approach enhances the model's ability to discern and prioritize important information, leading to improved classification and comprehension performance.\n  - Integrating hierarchical attention into GAUs can enable the model to maintain a structured understanding of input sequences, facilitating better handling of complex dependencies without a proportional increase in computational resources.\n\n- **Adaptive Memory Systems:**\n  - Techniques like **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) demonstrate that freezing most model weights and injecting low-rank matrices can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, leading to more efficient fine-tuning and inference. This strategy can be adapted within GAUs to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n  - **Adaptive Attention Span in Transformers** introduces a mechanism where the model learns optimal attention spans, allowing it to focus computational resources on more relevant parts of the input while ignoring less pertinent segments. This adaptability can be crucial for handling varying input complexities and lengths.\n\n- **Dynamic Retention Strategies:**\n  - Gated mechanisms, as employed in hierarchical and bias tagging networks, control the flow of information by selectively attending to important features while filtering out noise or redundant data. This selective processing not only enhances model expressiveness but also contributes to computational savings by reducing unnecessary computations.\n  - **Dynamic Snake Convolution** and **TriRE** introduce advanced retention strategies that manage information flow and state persistence based on dynamic criteria, ensuring that the model efficiently retains and processes relevant information over extended sequences.\n\n- **Scalable Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Performers** offer a linear-time approximation to the traditional quadratic attention mechanism, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Integrating such scalable attention mechanisms into GAUs can enable models to handle longer contexts and larger datasets without incurring prohibitive resource costs.\n  - **DenseMamba** and **Eagle and Finch** further explore scalable architectures by enhancing state space models with dense connections and dynamic recurrence mechanisms, balancing expressivity with efficiency.\n\n- **Length Extrapolation and Regular Reasoning:**\n  - The **A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer** and **RegularGPT** demonstrate that modifying positional embeddings and constructing working memory can empower Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. These strategies are essential for deploying models in real-world applications where input lengths can vary unpredictably.\n\n### 4. Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\nTo further refine the design of the novel GAU within the RetNet architecture, the following search plan is proposed:\n\n1. **Explore Integration of Hierarchical Attention with Adaptive Memory:**\n   - Investigate how hierarchical attention mechanisms can be synergistically combined with adaptive memory systems to enhance multi-scale dependency modeling and memory efficiency in GAUs.\n\n2. **Investigate Advanced Gated Mechanisms:**\n   - Delve deeper into gated attention and retention strategies to control information flow effectively, ensuring that GAUs process only the most relevant parts of the input dynamically.\n\n3. **Examine Scalable Attention Implementations:**\n   - Study the implementation and performance of linear-time attention mechanisms like Performers within GAUs to achieve scalability without compromising attention quality.\n\n4. **Analyze Meta-Learning Approaches for Dynamic Adaptation:**\n   - Explore meta-learning frameworks that allow GAUs to adapt their attention and memory mechanisms in real-time based on input complexity and task requirements.\n\n5. **Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation:**\n   - Identify and review empirical studies that benchmark hierarchical, adaptive, and dynamic GAUs against standard Transformer models to understand performance trade-offs and benefits.\n\n6. **Review Recent Advances in Length Extrapolation:**\n   - Investigate latest research on positional embeddings and memory construction in Transformers that enable length extrapolation, to integrate similar strategies within GAUs.\n\n### 5.

DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Assaf Ben-Kish, Itamar Zimerman, Shady Abu-Hussein, Nadav Cohen, Amir Globerson, Lior Wolf, Raja Giryes*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DeciMamba is introduced, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba that can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Long-range sequence processing poses a significant challenge for Transformers due to their quadratic complexity in input length. A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024. Vision mamba: Efficient visual representation learning with bidirectional state space model. arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.09417. ## A Experimental Details\n\nAll model checkpoints are taken from the Hugging Face Model Hub ${ }^{1}$ :\n\n- state-spaces/mamba-130m\n- state-spaces/mamba-370m\n- state-spaces/mamba-790m\n- state-spaces/mamba-1.4b\n- state-spaces/mamba-2.8b\n\nOur code is based on the official Mamba implementation. ${ }^{2}$\n\n## A. 1 Passkey Retrieval\n\nEach model is trained for 5 epochs with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 32 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer (Kingma and Ba , 2017) with weight decay of 0.1 . In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

The figure compares two pooling strategies, Top- $P_{s}$ (ours) and Top- $K \\%$. As shown, the Top- $K \\%$ approach lags behind the Top- $P_{s}$ approach, demonstrating that our strategy allows the model to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences. Results are for Mamba-130m. Layer 17\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-12.jpg?height=463&width=758&top_left_y=868&top_left_x=1050)\n\nFigure 12: Pooling Strategy Ablation. Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

The horizontal and vertical axes indicate the token number and the channel respectively.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing. Our code is public.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/47 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n(4). This enables the architecture to get away with a number of computational steps reflecting the depth of the computational graph rather than the length of the input. Bottom up approach for improving model architectures. Transformers have seen tremendous successes across various application domains (Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al, 2020, Dosovitskiy et al. 2021). Impressive results have been reported when they are scaled up with a large amount of data (Brown et al. 2020). On the other hand, simple tasks like those highlighted in the present work demonstrate that the Transformer architecture still struggles with basic reasoning. Particularly in algorithmic tasks, it is often the case that a sub-optimal choice of architecture/optimization method makes the model fall back to simple memorization. We argue that it is crucial to look at isolated problems which test specific generalization capability. This calls for a bottom-up approach: building on toy tasks that focus on individual aspects of generalization and using them for improving models. ## 6 RELATED WORK\n\nGating inside Transformers. Several prior works have proposed to use some sort of gating within Transformer architectures (Parisotto et al. 2020, Chaabouni et al. 2021). Our proposed copy gate\nis different from those as it satisfies two important properties. First, our copy gate allows the model to skip the entire Transformer layer (i.e., both the self-attention and the feedforward blocks) when the gate is closed. Second, the gate function is conditioned on the attention output such that the decision of opening or closing depends on information from all columns. While multiple gating variants have been proposed by Parisotto et al. (2020) to stabilize Transformers for reinforcement learning, none of them can produce this behavior. Empirically, we also tried out a few other gating variants which do not satisfy the two properties above; we found them not to improve over regular Transformers in our preliminary experiments on compositional table lookup. Recent work by Chaabouni et al. (2021) also makes use of \"gating\" in Transformers through a gated linear unit (GLU) activation function commonly used in convolutional NNs (Dauphin et al., 2017). Transformer models with such an activation function were reported to outperform RNN baselines on a systematic generalization task (Dess\u00ec \\& Baroni, 2019). Unlike our copy gate or Parisotto et al. (2020)'s gating, such a gating activation does not have the \"residual\" term (i.e. a closed gate zeros out the input) which allows the model to skip a transformation. In a more general context, benefits of the GLU activation in Transformers vary across tasks (Irie et al. 2019; Shazeer, 2020). In language modeling, no improvement is typically obtained by using the standard highway gate instead of the residual connection in Transformers (Irie, 2020), while it yields improvements when combined with convolutional layers Kim \\& Rush, 2016). Parameterized geometric distributions. Two recent works (Brooks et al., 2021, Banino et al., 2021) have used a form of parameterized geometric distribution (PGD; in the form of Eq. 77. Brooks et al. (2021) have used such a distribution to parameterize the movement of a pointer on a sequence of instructions. Banino et al. (2021) have used it to implement adaptive computation time (Schmidhuber, 2012, Graves, 2016). We use the PGD to obtain a generic attention mechanism as a replacement of the standard self-attention used in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Compositional table lookup. CTL task was proposed for evaluating the compositional ability of NNs (Liska et al., 2018). Previous works evaluated RNNs, RNNs with attention, and Transformers on this task with limited success (Hupkes et al., 2019, Dubois et al., 2020). Dubois et al. (2020) have proposed a special attention mechanism to augment the recurrent architecture. While they obtained good performance for the forward presentation order, the proposed model failed in the backward one. In contrast, two of our approaches (Sec. 3.1) achieve $100 \\%$ generalization accuracy for both orders. Positional encodings. Many previous works have focused on improving positional encoding (Schmidhuber, 1992; Vaswani et al., 2017) for self-attention. Most notably, the relative positional encoding (Schmidhuber, 1992; Shaw et al., 2018; Dai et al., 2019) was found useful for improving systematic generalization of Transformers (Csord\u00e1s et al., 2021). Here we also present two new approaches related to positional encoding. One is the gated combination of absolute and relative positional encoding (Sec. 3.1, details in Appendix B. We show that absolute positional encoding can complement relative positional encoding. The former enables the model to always attend to a specific position, as is needed for the CTL task in the last step, while the gating allows it to use relative positional encoding for other positions/steps. Second, we introduce directional encoding to augment geometric attention. Unlike positional encoding which can overfit to a range of positions seen during training, the direction information is found to be robust and to be a crucial augmentation of the geometric attention. ## 7 CONCLUSION\n\nWe proposed a new view on the internal operations of Transformer encoders as a dynamic dataflow architecture between Transformer columns. This overcomes two shortcomings of traditional Transformers: the problem of routing and retaining data in an unaltered fashion, which we solve by an additional copy gate, and the problem of learning length-independent attention patterns, which we solve by geometric attention. Our new model, the Neural Data Router (NDR), generalizes to compositions longer than those seen during training on the popular compositional lookup table task in both forward and backward directions. NDR also achieves near perfect performance on simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks in settings that test systematic generalization in terms of computational depth. In general, the gates and the attention maps collectively make the architecture more interpretable than the baselines. Future work will extend this encoder-only architecture to a full sequence-to-sequence model and evaluate it on other standard tasks in systematic generalization requiring generation of variable-length output sequences. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Imanol Schlag and Sjoerd van Steenkiste for helpful discussions and suggestions on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Score: 0.85)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.78)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/40 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nWe refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020) for a more detailed analysis of different transformer variants. Additional Inductive Biases. While a lot of the above transformer variations are designed to prevent the quadratic bottleneck, most of them also add certain additional inductive biases in the model. For example, the addition of sparsity not only reduces the computational complexity but also adds the additional inductive bias of sparse information routing between different elements. There are certain additional variants (Lamb et al., 2021; Goyal et al., 2021b) that add other inductive biases, eg. factorized state space and global workspace bottleneck respectively in the transformer model. ## A. 3 MODULARITY, COMPOSITIONALITY, REUSABILITY AND BOTTLENECK\n\nThere have been recent efforts along the lines of modularized computations in an effort to improve the model's capacity to perform systematic generalization. In particular, humans are able to compartmentalize information and act on it in a disentangled, context-driven and robust fashion. These cognitive fundamentals have led to a preliminary movement of Machine Learning systems into this space. We discuss some of the essential ingredients below. Modularity. Modularity refers to factorization of knowledge into smaller components that can independently exist and act on sensory information. It can be considered as disentangled representations that allow for interventions on these different components or factorized mechanisms where each mechanism has a specific purpose and can act on a part or whole of the sensory information. The fundamental aim of modularity is to prevent unrestricted information flow across a whole monolitihic system and instead to learn in an often end-to-end fashion factorized representations and mechanisms that act on these representations. Recent works (Goyal et al., 2019; 2020; 2021a; Mittal et al., 2020; Madan et al., 2021; Lamb et al., 2021; Ke et al., 2021) along the lines of factorizing knowledge demonstrate that it often leads to increased robustness and better OoD performance. Compositionality and Reusability. Humans are able to perform complex tasks even in novel and unknown situations. This capacity often stems from the fact that our complex actions are in reality compositions of simpler primitives and our understanding of these primitives is so good that we are able to dynamically combine these primitives into novel complex actions. Recent research has started looking into tasks and systems that test and allow for compositional generalization (Lake \\& Baroni, 2018a; Li et al., 2019; Keysers et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Hupkes et al., 2020; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020), which is generalization to novel combinations of the underlying primitives/mechanisms. The primary reason why a number of modular systems are constructed in recurrent domains is because we want the factorized mechanisms to be reusable in a number of scenarios. Reusability of knowledge (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019) allows for learning of disentangled mechanisms in a modular system which then has the potential to lead to efficient compositions of the learned disentangled mechanisms. Recent success of systems that use computations that can be reused multiple times demonstrates that reusability is actually an important fundamental for obtaining compositionality. Bottleneck. Conscious attention in humans is a key ingredient to create a bottleneck of information processing, according to the Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene et al., 2017). The key use of this bottleneck is to restrict information flow across the whole network, human brain or otherwise, which allows for robustness to insignificant pieces of sensory information. The usefulness of this bottleneck has been hypothesized to be linked to the sparsity and simplicity of the dependencies manipulated with System 2 cognition (Bengio, 2017; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020). Recent works along these lines (Goyal et al., 2021b) illustrate that modular systems with the addition of a bottleneck efficiently factorize computations and then compose them in a dynamic and context dependent fashion often lead to improved performance, faster adaptation and systematic generalization (Bengio et al., 2019; Ke et al., 2021). ## B PROPOSED MODEL\n\nIn this section, we provide additional details about the general motivation, architecture setup and our argument for using parameter sharing across layers. We further provide details about computational complexity of the proposed model and some ablations that we consider. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=473&width=1392&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=364)\n\nFigure 8: Performance on Contextual Retrieval Task. We compare our proposed model against standard Multi-Head attention (lower loss is better) on various setups of the task. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. ## B. 1 MotivATION\n\nWhile the setting in Figure 1 may look idealistic in the sense that it is very likely that transformer heads do not learn this interpretable single feature functions for search and retrieval, we argue that this rigidity still exists between search and retrieval in a standard multi-head attention framework. To see this, we note that the search component Search $_{h}$, is parameterized by the query and key matrices $W_{q_{h}}$ and $W_{k_{h}}$ respectively and the retrieval component Retrieval ${ }_{h}$ is parameterized by the value matrices $W_{v_{h}}$. Both these components lead to computations that are dynamic based on the input but\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=45&width=1386&top_left_y=1227&top_left_x=367) (notice the same $h$ subscript), also highlighted in Equation 5. Thus, whenever there is a need to share retrieval parameterizations across multiple searches, a standard multi-head attention would lead to learning of redundancies because there is no notion of sharing of retrievals between searches. Contrasting this with the proposed approach, Compositional Attention, we see that now there is a notion of sharing of retrievals for different searches. That is, two different searches can still opt for the same retrieval parameterization, which alleviates the rigidity and redundancy that is explained above. Note that this discussion does not depend on the model's capacity to selectively pick features as is illustrated in Figure 1. This shows that irrespective of what these searches and retrievals learn, the discussed drawbacks of multi-head attention still exist if an optimal solution requires sharing of retrievals across searches. We highlight the motivation through the idealistic example of multiple features solely for ease of explanation and appealing to the fundamental cognitively inspired inductive bias that we try to incorporate. We emphasize that multi-head attention and the proposed compositional attention are not two separate classes of methods. In fact, our proposed mechanism is a strict superset of multi-head attention and thus presents a more general framework that subsumes the family of multi-head attention. One can see this from Equation 13 where, given enough capacity to represent any $h \\times h$ matrix, we recover multi-head attention by setting the number of searches and retrievals as $h$ and having the \"Value Scores\" matrix as an $h \\times h$ identity matrix (or any $h \\times h$ permutation matrix in general), with $h$ being the number of heads. Thus our mechanism not only solves the redundancies highlighted in this text but also provides a more general class of attention mechanism. ## B. 2 DIFFERENCES FROM EXISTING WORK\n\nWe propose Compositional Attention, a novel attention mechanism aimed at a disentangled computation of search and retrieval. Unlike in multi-head attention, this allows for a flexible and dynamic composition of searches and retrievals. This is different from MAC and its variants (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018) because the proposed algorithm is a completely parallel system without recurrence. Further, we see that in MAC, disentanglement is driven by privileged information; i.e. through the difference between what a question and image is. This privileged information may not be present across a variety of tasks (eg. language modelling, classification, etc.). Our proposed model, however, does not require privileged information and is therefore easily applicable to a lot of different domains. Further, MAC\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-17.jpg?height=473&width=1391&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 9: Performance on OoD Contextual Retrieval Task. We showcase that our proposed mechanism outperforms standard Multi-Head attention (lower is better) on out of distribution (OoD) variant of the various setups across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. does not have multiple parallel searches and retrievals and thus, our proposed model aims to solve a considerably different problem. While one may be tempted to think of head pruning (Michel et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019) as a way of removing redundancies in standard multi-head attention, we stress that the core goal and motivation of our work is considerably different. Pruning of a head essentially means we eliminate a rigid search-retrieval pairing from the learned system as its utility for solving the task is negligible. However, in this work, the redundancy we want to solve is when a sub-part of a head is redundant but not the whole head. That is, when either the search or retrieval part of the head is redundant, but not both. Figure 1 highlights when only a sub-part of the head is redundant and not the whole head, and how compositional attention resolves the problem. Further, Compositional Attention is different from the various transformer variants Appendix A. 2 because it does not aim to solve the quadratic computational bottleneck but instead adds an inductive bias that has not been explored yet. We also note that the proposed model is amenable to the various computation tricks discovered for multi-head attention. ## B. 3 ARCHitECTURE DETAILS\n\nThe standard transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) has a number of layers, where each layer is composed of two components, the multi-head attention (Section 2.1) which is followed by a MLP (Multi-layer perceptron) with a single hidden layer. There are residual connections at the end of the multi-head attention step as well as the MLP. In this work, we follow Dehghani et al. (2018) and consider the models that have weight sharing across layers. For ease of experiments, we do not consider adaptive stopping criteria. We consider this choice because we want reusable pieces of computations, and Universal Transformers is one step towards that goal. Our view of transformer models is that different heads perform parallel information retrieval with not only different kinds of searches but also different kinds of retrievals. Information from these parallel retrievals is then jointly processed through a linear layer, followed by another MLP. There are residual connections after the linear layer and the MLP. For our proposed Compositional variants, we basically replace Multi-Head Attention in the models with Compositional Attention while keeping all the other details the same. ## B. 4 MultiPle LayERS AND WEIGHT SHARING\n\nA number of works demonstrate that Transformers with weight sharing are competitive with the standard transformer models (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019). We also believe that reusing computations provides more pressure on the system to learn meaningful and multi-purpose parameters (eg. it is easier to learn a redundant head if it is used only once vs if it is repeatedly used). One might be tempted to think that increasing the number of layers or removing weight sharing might compensate for the flexibility provided by our proposed system. However, we argue otherwise. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-18.jpg?height=414&width=1381&top_left_y=281&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 10: Convergence on Contextual Retrieval Task. We see that the proposed mechanism converges faster and works well even in low data regime (low iterations). Lets assume we have a Transformer model without parameter sharing which has $l$ layers and $h$ heads. Then, the number of unique search-retrieval pairings that can be computed by the model is $l h$ ( $h$ if parameter sharing). Contrasting this with compositional attention, we see that the number of unique search-retrieval pairings are actually $l s r$ ( $s r$ if parameter sharing) where $s$ is the number of searches and $r$ the number of retrievals. So, if we use a similar number of layers, compositional attention still allows for more combinatorial possibilities to be learnt. Viewed another way, at scale, the proposed mechanism has the potential to reduce the number of layers needed for tasks calling for flexible search and retrievals. Another important point is that even if we have more layers (with or without parameter sharing), multi-head attention can still only learn a rigid combination between search and retrieval. So, if the task requires dynamic choice from all possible pairings between search and retrieval, the model will have to learn each pairing in separate head combinations, whether it be in the same or future layers. This is because adding more layers does not change the way searches and retrievals are combined, which is what we focus on here. ## B. 5 COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY\n\nNumber of Parameters. We keep the parameter counts within 5\\% of each other for the compared models and the same parameter count at 140M parameters for the language modelling experiment. We also stress that our proposed models with fewer retrievals are even more tightly matched and often lower in parameters than the baseline and still outperform them on a number of tasks. Training Time. While Compositional Attention increases the complexity of the model, we note that the training time of proposed models are generally within $\\sim 10 \\%$ of the baseline and hence the added complexity does not impede the model much. FLOPs. We estimate the FLOPs of the proposed model for Equilateral Triangle Detection task using an off the shelf library ${ }^{2}$ and see that they are $\\sim 10 \\%$ of each other and the baseline. In particular, we also see that for fewer retrievals, the FLOPs are either the same or lower than the baseline. Parallel Computations. Transformers allow for efficient implementation using GPUs due to parallel computations for each word in the sentence (or each object in the scene). Further, they allow for parallel computation of each head for each word. Correspondingly, in our proposed model, we still do parallel computations for each word in the sentence, and compute the output of different searches in parallel. The only additional complexity is another soft-attention for choice of retrieval for each search. This is also done in parallel for each search and hence we retain all the major efficiencies that Multi-Head attention enjoys on GPUs. Amenable to Different Variations. We note that a lot of the current advances in standard multi-head attention, eg. sparse attention matrix, can be incorporated in the proposed model too. We can also have sparsity on the retrieval end where we can restrict certain searches to pick from a smaller set of retrievals. We believe that these analysis are important future works but out of scope of this paper. Complexity vs Combinatorial Advantages. While we sometimes have more complexity than multihead attention, this small increase in complexity is often offset by the combinatorial advantage that\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-19.jpg?height=394&width=1399&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=363)\n\nFigure 11: Specialization plots for the Contextual Retrieval Task. We plot the attention scores for ground truth retrieval vs learned retrieval for different task setups - left: 1 search 2 retrieval, middle: 1 search 4 retrieval, and right: 2 search 4 retrieval. we gain. In particular, for $h$ search and retrievals, multi-head attention can only compute $h$ possible search-retrieval pairings while the proposed model can compute $h^{2}$ possible pairings.\n```\n\n\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Summary of Analysis\n\nIn the pursuit of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that surpasses current state-of-the-art models in perplexity, downstream task accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability, the integration of **hierarchical attention mechanisms**, **adaptive memory systems**, and **dynamic retention strategies** emerges as a promising direction. \n\nThe gathered research highlights the effectiveness of hierarchical attention in capturing multi-scale dependencies, enabling models to understand and process information at varying granularities. Adaptive memory systems, such as low-rank adaptations and uncertainty-aware compression, facilitate efficient memory utilization, allowing models to handle longer sequences and more complex tasks without compromising performance. Dynamic retention strategies, including gated mechanisms and selective information flow, enhance model expressiveness and robustness by ensuring that only pertinent information is processed and retained. Additionally, scalable attention mechanisms like Performers offer solutions to the quadratic complexity of traditional attention, making it feasible to deploy larger models with longer context lengths.\n\n### 2.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - Hierarchical attention, as seen in Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) and Collective Event Detection, effectively captures multi-scale dependencies by processing information at both word and higher granularities (e.g., sentences or turns). This approach enhances the model's ability to discern and prioritize important information, leading to improved classification and comprehension performance.\n  - Integrating hierarchical attention into GAUs can enable the model to maintain a structured understanding of input sequences, facilitating better handling of complex dependencies without a proportional increase in computational resources.\n\n- **Adaptive Memory Systems:**\n  - Techniques like **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) demonstrate that freezing most model weights and injecting low-rank matrices can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters, leading to more efficient fine-tuning and inference. This strategy can be adapted within GAUs to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n  - **Adaptive Attention Span in Transformers** introduces a mechanism where the model learns optimal attention spans, allowing it to focus computational resources on more relevant parts of the input while ignoring less pertinent segments. This adaptability can be crucial for handling varying input complexities and lengths.\n\n- **Dynamic Retention Strategies:**\n  - Gated mechanisms, as employed in hierarchical and bias tagging networks, control the flow of information by selectively attending to important features while filtering out noise or redundant data. This selective processing not only enhances model expressiveness but also contributes to computational savings by reducing unnecessary computations.\n  - **Dynamic Snake Convolution** and **TriRE** introduce advanced retention strategies that manage information flow and state persistence based on dynamic criteria, ensuring that the model efficiently retains and processes relevant information over extended sequences.\n\n- **Scalable Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - **Performers** offer a linear-time approximation to the traditional quadratic attention mechanism, maintaining performance while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Integrating such scalable attention mechanisms into GAUs can enable models to handle longer contexts and larger datasets without incurring prohibitive resource costs.\n  - **DenseMamba** and **Eagle and Finch** further explore scalable architectures by enhancing state space models with dense connections and dynamic recurrence mechanisms, balancing expressivity with efficiency.\n\n- **Length Extrapolation and Regular Reasoning:**\n  - The **A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer** and **RegularGPT** demonstrate that modifying positional embeddings and constructing working memory can empower Transformers to generalize to longer sequences than those encountered during training. These strategies are essential for deploying models in real-world applications where input lengths can vary unpredictably.\n\n### 4. Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\nTo further refine the design of the novel GAU within the RetNet architecture, the following search plan is proposed:\n\n1. **Explore Integration of Hierarchical Attention with Adaptive Memory:**\n   - Investigate how hierarchical attention mechanisms can be synergistically combined with adaptive memory systems to enhance multi-scale dependency modeling and memory efficiency in GAUs.\n\n2. **Investigate Advanced Gated Mechanisms:**\n   - Delve deeper into gated attention and retention strategies to control information flow effectively, ensuring that GAUs process only the most relevant parts of the input dynamically.\n\n3. **Examine Scalable Attention Implementations:**\n   - Study the implementation and performance of linear-time attention mechanisms like Performers within GAUs to achieve scalability without compromising attention quality.\n\n4. **Analyze Meta-Learning Approaches for Dynamic Adaptation:**\n   - Explore meta-learning frameworks that allow GAUs to adapt their attention and memory mechanisms in real-time based on input complexity and task requirements.\n\n5. **Benchmarking and Performance Evaluation:**\n   - Identify and review empirical studies that benchmark hierarchical, adaptive, and dynamic GAUs against standard Transformer models to understand performance trade-offs and benefits.\n\n6. **Review Recent Advances in Length Extrapolation:**\n   - Investigate latest research on positional embeddings and memory construction in Transformers that enable length extrapolation, to integrate similar strategies within GAUs.\n\n### 5.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/27 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nLianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, and Xinggang Wang. 2024.

In each epoch the models train over 6144 sequences of length 2 K . For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.5$, decimating_layers $=$ $[13, \\ldots, 21]$, min_seq_len $=20$. ## A. 2 Document Retrieval\n\nWe train each model with data from SQuAD v2 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018), which provides examples in the form of (Query, Document, Answer). Our training samples have the following form: <Query>; $N_{\\text {docs }} \\times<$ Document>; $<$ Answer $>$, where $<$ Document $>$ can be either the golden document (which holds the answer to the query) or one of $N_{d o c s}-1$ randomly sampled documents. $<$ Answer $>$ holds the id of the golden document. In our setting $N_{d o c s}=11$, the order of the documents is random, and the query and respective document id are appended to the beginning of each document. During Evaluation we use the same setting but vary the value of $N_{\\text {docs }}$, between 11 and 300. We note that an average document in SQuAD has a length of about 200 tokens, so our average training sample has about 2,000 tokens, and the evaluation samples vary between 2,000 tokens to 60,000 tokens. We train for one epoch with 300 steps, use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 .

Top- $K \\%$ pooling leads to a limited ERF in layer 17. The size of the attention map is affected by the input sequence length: for $L_{\\text {eval }}=2 K$ layer 17 will process 65 tokens (left) and for $L_{\\text {eval }}=32 \\mathrm{~K}$ it will process 1 K tokens (right). Since $L_{\\text {train }}=2 K$, layer 17 has only seen training sequences of length 65 , therefore suffers from an ERF when $L_{\\text {eval }}$ increases (right, dashed orange shape). ## A. 3 Multi-Document Question Answering With Free Text Response\n\nWe operate in a similar setting as in Section A.2, but instead of predicting the tokens of the id of the relevant document we let the model generate a free-text response and measure it's F1 score w.r.t a set of ground truth answers. We train each model for one epoch on the full SQuAD train set (about 90,000 examples when leaving out the samples intended for negative sampling, which do not have a ground-truth answer). We found that the optimal decimation parameters are decimation_layer $=14$, $L_{\\text {base }}=2000$ during training and $L_{\\text {base }}=7000$ during evaluation. We intentionally decreased Lbase during training so the model could experience decimation during the training period ( $L_{\\text {train }}$ was a bit higher than $L_{\\text {base }}$ ), because otherwise the training of DeciMamba and Mamba would have been identical. We use a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 64 (used batch accumu-\nlation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . ## A. 4 PG-19 Perplexity\n\nWe train each model on a total of 100 M tokens with a learning rate of $1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, gradient clipping of 1 , batch size of 250 (used batch accumulation) and AdamW optimizer with weight decay of 0.1 . During training we sample a single window from each example and train on it (For the extrapolating models the window length is 2 K , for the lower bound models the window length is equal to the context length trained on). During evaluation, for each example we evaluate 10 windows with a maximal constant stride. We evaluate only the last 100 labels in each window, which represent the extrapolation abilities of the model at sequence lengths in the range of [ctx_len -100 , ctx_len], providing an approximation to the model's performance at the wanted ctx_len. For DeciMamba-130M we use L_base $=2 K, \\beta=0.83$, decimating_layers $=$ $[12, \\ldots, 20]$, min_seq_len $=20$. During evaluation we keep the same parameters except setting L_base $=8 K$. Additionally, in this specific task DeciMamba was trained with a similar, yet not identical, Language Modeling (LM) loss. We break the labels sequence (length $=2 \\mathrm{~K}$ ) into two chunks. The first 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the first 1 K tokens of the sequence (like vanilla $\\mathrm{LM})$. The last 1 K labels are trained conditionally on the whole sequence ( 2 K ), and DeciMamba was configured to compress the first 1 K input tokens. This way we are able to train DeciMamba to compress context while training on each label in the sequence, making the training much more efficient. We also experimented with chunking the labels into more than two chunks, but only experienced a slowdown in computation while achieving similar performance. For the lower bound models we had to reduce the amount of training steps in order to constrain the training to 100M tokens. Specifically, for each context length, we followed the following formula: num_of_steps $=100 \\mathrm{M} /$ (batch_size* $\\left.c t x \\_l e n\\right)=100 M /\\left(250 * c t x \\_l e n\\right)$. For the ZeroShot perplexity test for the 1.4 b model we used Layer 12 for decimation and $L_{b a s e}=4000$. For the 2.8 b model we used Layer 22 for decimation and $L_{\\text {base }}=4000$. ## B Other Related Work\n\n## B. 1 Long Range Transformers. Transformers have emerged as highly effective models for various tasks, yet their widespread adoption has been constrained by their limited longrange modeling capabilities. Thus, applying transformers effectively to long-range data remains a central challenge in DL, particularly in NLP. A primary factor in this challenge is that the effective context of transformers is dominated by the context observed during training, which is limited because training LLMs on datasets with billions of tokens across lengthy sequences is computationally demanding. Hence, three main approaches have been developed to tackle this problem: (i) creating efficient variants of transformers that allow an increase in the length of sequences during training. (ii) Context extension methods, which enable training on short sequences and evaluation on long sequences, and finally, (iii) hierarchical models that rely on pooling, chunking, and compression. Despite these extensive efforts, several recent studies indicate that high-quality handling of long text remains an unresolved issue (Liu et al., 2024a; Li et al., 2024). Efficient transformers. Over the years, many approaches have been proposed for making transformers more efficient (Tay et al., 2022; Fournier et al., 2023). The two most prominent directions are hardware-aware implementations such as flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) and ringattention (Liu et al., 2023), which accelerate computations over long sequences by several orders of magnitude. Additionally, developing efficient attention variants with sub-quadratic complexity has become very popular. Two notable examples are Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), which utilizes a low-rank attention matrix, and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), a variant that approximates the attention operator through a kernel function. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-14.jpg?height=549&width=1599&top_left_y=441&top_left_x=237)\nFigure 13: Demonstrating the 'Importance-Scoring' Abilities of $\\Delta_{t}$.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

This perspective underscores the importance of margin maximization in enhancing attention's discriminative power.\n\n- **Compositional Attention Mechanism:**\n  - **Compositional Attention** disentangles search and retrieval within attention heads, allowing for dynamic and context-dependent composition of search-retrieval pairs. This flexibility reduces parameter redundancy and enhances the model's ability to generalize across varied tasks, outperforming traditional multi-head attention in several benchmarks.\n\n- **Model Efficiency and Parameter Sharing:**\n  - Weight sharing across layers, as explored in multiple studies, can lead to efficient parameter utilization without compromising performance. This strategy, combined with adaptive and hierarchical attention mechanisms, can facilitate more efficient and scalable model architectures.\n\n- **Length Extrapolation Capabilities:**\n  - Techniques that enable length extrapolation (e.g., **DeciMamba**, **RegularGPT**) are crucial for deploying models in real-world applications where input lengths can vary unpredictably. These methods ensure that models maintain performance even when handling sequences longer than those encountered during training.\n\n### 4.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/70 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism \n\nDavoud Ataee Tarzanagh<br>University of Pennsylvania<br>tarzanaq@upenn.edu\n\nYingcong Li Xuechen Zhang<br>University of California, Riverside<br>\\{yli692, xzhan394\\}@ucr.edu\n\nSamet Oymak<br>University of Michigan<br>UC Riverside<br>oymak@umich.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAttention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Yihang Gao, Han Shi, Minbin Huang, Jingyao Li, Jing Xiong, Xiaozhe Ren, Michael Ng, Xin Jiang, Zhenguo Li, Yu Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors is proposed, which enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Positional encoding plays a crucial role in transformers, significantly impacting model performance and length generalization. Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/29 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Besides algorithms manipulating explicit position features, the success of Transformers without position encodings (NoPE) provides a new way to overcome the challenge. In this paper, we study the length generalization property of NoPE. We find that although NoPE can extend to longer sequences than the commonly used explicit position encodings, it still has a limited context length. We identify a connection between the failure of NoPE's generalization and the distraction of attention distributions. We propose a parameter-efficient tuning for searching attention heads' best temperature hyper-parameters, which substantially expands NoPE's context size. Experiments on long sequence language modeling, the synthetic passkey retrieval task and real-world long context tasks show that NoPE can achieve competitive performances with state-of-the-art length generalization algorithms.

Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Max-Margin Attention Mechanism*\n\n*Takeru Miyato, Bernhard Jaeger, Max Welling, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work argues that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure, and proposes a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Max-Margin Attention Mechanism*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers is proposed and sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA).\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Context-Based Dynamic Pricing with Partially Linear Demand Model\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Linear Attention*\n\n*Jinzhi Bu, D. Simchi-Levi, Chong Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The numerical results demonstrate that the learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms, and reveal the effects of parameters d, \u03b2 and \u03b4 on the algorithm\u2019s empirical regret, which are consistent with the theoretical findings.\n\n**Abstract:** In today\u2019s data-rich environment, context-based dynamic pricing has gained much attention. To model the demand as a function of price and context, the existing literature either adopts a parametric model or a non-parametric model. The former is easier to implement but may suffer from model mis-specification, whereas the latter is more robust but does not leverage many structural properties of the underlying problem. This paper combines these two approaches by studying the context-based dynamic pricing with online learning, where the unknown expected demand admits a semi-parametric partially linear structure. Specifically, we consider two demand models, whose expected demand at price p \u2208 R + and context x \u2208 R d is given by bp + g ( x ) and f ( p ) + a \u22a4 x respectively. We assume that g ( x ) is \u03b2 -H\u00f6lder continuous in the first model, and f ( p ) is k th-order smooth with an additional parameter \u03b4 in the second model. For both models, we design an efficient online learning algorithm with provable regret upper bounds, and establish matching lower bounds. This enables us to characterize the statistical complexity for the two learning models, whose optimal regret rates are (cid:101) \u0398( \u221a T \u2228 T d d +2 \u03b2 ) and (cid:101) \u0398( \u221a T \u2228 ( \u03b4T k +1 ) 1 2 k +1 ) respectively. The numerical results demonstrate that our learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms, and also reveal the effects of parameters d , \u03b2 and \u03b4 on the algorithm\u2019s empirical regret, which are consistent with our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Linear Attention*\n\n*Chao Li, Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 148  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. KernelWarehouse: Rethinking the Design of Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Linear Attention*\n\n*Chao Li, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** KernelWarehouse is proposed, a more general form of dynamic convolution, which redefines the basic concepts of ``kernels\", ``assembling kernels\" and ``attention function\" through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic convolution learns a linear mixture of n static kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions, demonstrating superior performance than normal convolution. However, it increases the number of convolutional parameters by n times, and thus is not parameter efficient. This leads to no research progress that can allow researchers to explore the setting n>100 (an order of magnitude larger than the typical setting n<10) for pushing forward the performance boundary of dynamic convolution while enjoying parameter efficiency. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose KernelWarehouse, a more general form of dynamic convolution, which redefines the basic concepts of ``kernels\", ``assembling kernels\"and ``attention function\"through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet. We testify the effectiveness of KernelWarehouse on ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets using various ConvNet architectures. Intriguingly, KernelWarehouse is also applicable to Vision Transformers, and it can even reduce the model size of a backbone while improving the model accuracy. For instance, KernelWarehouse (n=4) achieves 5.61%|3.90%|4.38% absolute top-1 accuracy gain on the ResNet18|MobileNetV2|DeiT-Tiny backbone, and KernelWarehouse (n=1/4) with 65.10% model size reduction still achieves 2.29% gain on the ResNet18 backbone.

HiRoPE: Length Extrapolation for Code Models Using Hierarchical Position\n\n*From Search Query: Length Extrapolation in Language Models*\n\n*Kechi Zhang, Ge Li, Huangzhao Zhang, Zhi Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code, and significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.\n\n**Abstract:** Addressing the limitation of context length in large language models for code-related tasks is the primary focus of this paper. Existing LLMs are constrained by their pre-trained context lengths, leading to performance issues in handling long complex code sequences. Inspired by how human programmers navigate code, we introduce Hierarchical Rotary Position Embedding (HiRoPE), a novel approach that enhances the traditional rotary position embedding into a hierarchical format based on the hierarchical structure of source code. HiRoPE offers easy integration into existing LLMs without extra training costs. Our method is extensively evaluated with various LLMs, demonstrating stable performance in tasks such as language modeling and long code completion. We also introduce a new long code understanding task with real-world code projects, in hopes of promoting further development in this code-related field. Theoretically and experimentally, we find that HiRoPE also addresses the out-of-distribution issue in position encoding. Our HiRoPE significantly expands the context length capabilities of LLMs, enabling inference at lengths exponentially greater than the training length.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Max-Margin Attention Mechanism*\n\n*Samet Oymak, Xuechen Zhang, Yingcong Li, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$.

Information Aggregation via Dynamic Routing for Sequence Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: Max-Margin Attention Mechanism*\n\n*Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu, Shaojing Wang, Jingjing Gong*\n\n**Abstract:** While much progress has been made in how to encode a text sequence into a\nsequence of vectors, less attention has been paid to how to aggregate these\npreceding vectors (outputs of RNN/CNN) into fixed-size encoding vector.\nUsually, a simple max or average pooling is used, which is a bottom-up and\npassive way of aggregation and lack of guidance by task information. In this\npaper, we propose an aggregation mechanism to obtain a fixed-size encoding with\na dynamic routing policy. The dynamic routing policy is dynamically deciding\nthat what and how much information need be transferred from each word to the\nfinal encoding of the text sequence. Following the work of Capsule Network, we\ndesign two dynamic routing policies to aggregate the outputs of RNN/CNN\nencoding layer into a final encoding vector. Compared to the other aggregation\nmethods, dynamic routing can refine the messages according to the state of\nfinal encoding vector. Experimental results on five text classification tasks\nshow that our method outperforms other aggregating models by a significant\nmargin.

TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Linear Attention*\n\n*Tomas Pfister, Sercan O. Arik, Nate Yoder, Chun-Liang Li, Si-An Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world time-series datasets are often multivariate with complex dynamics. To capture this complexity, high capacity architectures like recurrent- or attention-based sequential deep learning models have become popular. However, recent work demonstrates that simple univariate linear models can outperform such deep learning models on several commonly used academic benchmarks. Extending them, in this paper, we investigate the capabilities of linear models for time-series forecasting and present Time-Series Mixer (TSMixer), a novel architecture designed by stacking multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). TSMixer is based on mixing operations along both the time and feature dimensions to extract information efficiently. On popular academic benchmarks, the simple-to-implement TSMixer is comparable to specialized state-of-the-art models that leverage the inductive biases of specific benchmarks. On the challenging and large scale M5 benchmark, a real-world retail dataset, TSMixer demonstrates superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Our results underline the importance of efficiently utilizing cross-variate and auxiliary information for improving the performance of time series forecasting. We present various analyses to shed light into the capabilities of TSMixer. The design paradigms utilized in TSMixer are expected to open new horizons for deep learning-based time series forecasting.

Just Jump: Dynamic Neighborhood Aggregation in Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Linear Attention*\n\n*Matthias Fey*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a dynamic neighborhood aggregation (DNA) procedure guided by\n(multi-head) attention for representation learning on graphs. In contrast to\ncurrent graph neural networks which follow a simple neighborhood aggregation\nscheme, our DNA procedure allows for a selective and node-adaptive aggregation\nof neighboring embeddings of potentially differing locality. In order to avoid\noverfitting, we propose to control the channel-wise connections between input\nand output by making use of grouped linear projections. In a number of\ntransductive node-classification experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-09\n\n\n\n#### 5. CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Length Extrapolation in Language Models*\n\n*Lidong Bing, Shangsong Liang, Zaiqiao Meng, Xin Li, Guanzheng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are pioneering advances in many natural language processing tasks, however, their exceptional capabilities are restricted within the preset context window of Transformer. Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to 32k. Our code is available at https://github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/CLEX.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-25\n\n\n\n#### 6. Long Context Transfer from Language to Vision\n\n*From Search Query: Length Extrapolation in Language Models*\n\n*Ziwei Liu, Chunyuan Li, Haoran Tan, Ziyue Wang, Yuanhan Zhang, Jingkang Yang, Guangtao Zeng, Bo Li, Kaichen Zhang, Peiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Video sequences offer valuable temporal information, but existing large multimodal models (LMMs) fall short in understanding extremely long videos. Many works address this by reducing the number of visual tokens using visual resamplers. Alternatively, in this paper, we approach this problem from the perspective of the language model. By simply extrapolating the context length of the language backbone, we enable LMMs to comprehend orders of magnitude more visual tokens without any video training. We call this phenomenon long context transfer and carefully ablate its properties. To effectively measure LMMs' ability to generalize to long contexts in the vision modality, we develop V-NIAH (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack), a purely synthetic long vision benchmark inspired by the language model's NIAH test. Our proposed Long Video Assistant (LongVA) can process 2000 frames or over 200K visual tokens without additional complexities. With its extended context length, LongVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-MME among 7B-scale models by densely sampling more input frames. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVA.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, we need to focus on several key areas: max-margin token selection in attention mechanisms, dynamic implementations of linear attention, and techniques for length extrapolation and efficient context handling.\n\n### Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Theoretical Foundations:**\n  - The concept of max-margin token selection can be formalized similar to Support Vector Machines (SVMs), where the goal is to maximize the margin between relevant and irrelevant tokens. This approach ensures that the attention mechanism focuses on the most relevant tokens, enhancing the discriminative power of the model.\n\n- **Practical Implementations:**\n  - A study titled \"Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism\" formalizes attention as an optimal token selection process, proving that gradient descent on query-key parameters converges to a solution that maximizes the margin between relevant and irrelevant tokens. This can be a crucial component in enhancing the attention mechanisms within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs).\n\n### Dynamic Implementations of Linear Attention\n\n- **Efficiency and Performance:**\n  - The paper \"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\" introduces an augmentation technique that ensures compatibility between linear attention mechanisms and speculative decoding. This synergy can reduce perplexity and speed up generation processes, making it highly relevant for efficient and scalable LM designs.\n\n- **Adaptive Attention Span:**\n  - \"Adaptive Attention Span in Transformers\" proposes a self-attention mechanism where each head learns its optimal attention span, allowing the model to focus computational resources on relevant parts of the input. This adaptive approach can be integrated into GAUs to enhance efficiency and performance.\n\n### Length Extrapolation and Efficient Context Handling\n\n- **DeciMamba:**\n  - \"DeciMamba: Exploring the Length Extrapolation Potential of Mamba\" introduces a method that enables context extension up to 25 times longer than the training sequence lengths without additional computational resources. This hidden filtering mechanism within the S6 layer can be adapted for GAUs to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention and Memory Systems:**\n  - Hierarchical attention networks, such as those described in \"Hierarchical Attention Networks for Document Classification,\" process information at multiple levels, capturing complex dependencies and prioritizing important content. Integrating such hierarchical attention mechanisms within GAUs can enhance their ability to handle long-range dependencies and varied input lengths.\n\n### Integration and Practical Considerations\n\n- **Scalable Attention Mechanisms:**\n  - Techniques like \"Performers\" and \"Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token\" reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional attention, enabling models to handle longer sequences and larger datasets more efficiently. These scalable attention mechanisms are crucial for maintaining performance while enhancing scalability.\n\n- **Adaptive Memory and Gating Mechanisms:**\n  - Methods such as \"LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\" and adaptive memory systems introduce trainable low-rank matrices and dynamic resource allocation, respectively. These strategies can be integrated into GAUs to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\n### Key References and Insights\n\n1. **Max-Margin Token Selection:**\n   - *Ataee Tarzanagh, D., Li, Y., Zhang, X., & Oymak, S.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional.

[^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 3. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/70 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism \n\nDavoud Ataee Tarzanagh<br>University of Pennsylvania<br>tarzanaq@upenn.edu\n\nYingcong Li Xuechen Zhang<br>University of California, Riverside<br>\\{yli692, xzhan394\\}@ucr.edu\n\nSamet Oymak<br>University of Michigan<br>UC Riverside<br>oymak@umich.edu\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAttention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models.\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/20 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition $(C V P R)$, pages 770-778, 2016. $\\left[\\mathrm{JGB}^{+}\\right.$21] Andrew Jaegle, Felix Gimeno, Andy Brock, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew Zisserman, and Jo\u00e3o Carreira.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. HyperAttention: Long-context Attention in Near-Linear Time\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention mechanisms*\n\n*Insu Han, Rajesh Jayaram, Amin Karbasi, V. Mirrokni, David P. Woodruff, A. Zandieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention is presented to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models, and is able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention. We validate the empirical performance of HyperAttention on a variety of different long-context length datasets. For example, HyperAttention makes the inference time of ChatGLM2 50\\% faster on 32k context length while perplexity increases from 5.6 to 6.3. On larger context length, e.g., 131k, with causal masking, HyperAttention offers 5-fold speedup on a single attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Cross-Layer Retrospective Retrieving via Layer Attention\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yanwen Fang, Yuxi Cai, Jintai Chen, Jingyu Zhao, Guangjian Tian, Guodong Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields to enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks.\n\n**Abstract:** More and more evidence has shown that strengthening layer interactions can enhance the representation power of a deep neural network, while self-attention excels at learning interdependencies by retrieving query-activated information. Motivated by this, we devise a cross-layer attention mechanism, called multi-head recurrent layer attention (MRLA), that sends a query representation of the current layer to all previous layers to retrieve query-related information from different levels of receptive fields. A light-weighted version of MRLA is also proposed to reduce the quadratic computation cost. The proposed layer attention mechanism can enrich the representation power of many state-of-the-art vision networks, including CNNs and vision transformers. Its effectiveness has been extensively evaluated in image classification, object detection and instance segmentation tasks, where improvements can be consistently observed. For example, our MRLA can improve 1.6% Top-1 accuracy on ResNet-50, while only introducing 0.16M parameters and 0.07B FLOPs. Surprisingly, it can boost the performances by a large margin of 3-4% box AP and mask AP in dense prediction tasks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Dynamic linear attention transformers*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 6.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

However, the emergence of transformers has altered this paradigm due to their superior performance. Built upon these advances, transformers have conjoined CNNs as two leading foundational models for learning visual representations. However, transformers are hindered by the $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of their attention mechanisms, while CNNs lack global receptive fields and dynamic weight allocation. State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the \\textit{\\textbf{Mamba}} model with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, have garnered immense interest lately in sequential modeling and visual representation learning, challenging the dominance of transformers by providing infinite context lengths and offering substantial efficiency maintaining linear complexity in the input sequence. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, medical imaging has heralded a new epoch with Mamba models. Intending to help researchers navigate the surge, this survey seeks to offer an encyclopedic review of Mamba models in medical imaging. Specifically, we start with a comprehensive theoretical review forming the basis of SSMs, including Mamba architecture and its alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context. Next, we offer a structured classification of Mamba models in the medical field and introduce a diverse categorization scheme based on their application, imaging modalities, and targeted organs. Finally, we summarize key challenges, discuss different future research directions of the SSMs in the medical domain, and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. In addition, we have compiled the studies discussed in this paper along with their open-source implementations on our GitHub repository.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Lightening-Transformer: A Dynamically-operated Optically-interconnected Photonic Transformer Accelerator\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Dynamic linear attention transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The wide adoption and significant computing resource of attention-based transformers, e.g., Vision Transformers and large language models (LLM), have driven the demand for efficient hardware accelerators. There is a growing interest in exploring photonics as an alternative technology to digital electronics due to its high energy efficiency and ultra-fast processing speed. Photonic accelerators have shown promising results for CNNs, which mainly rely on weight-static linear operations. However, they encounter issues when efficiently supporting Transformer architectures, questioning the applicability of photonics to advanced ML tasks. The primary hurdle lies in their inefficiency in handling unique workloads in Transformers, i.e., dynamic and full-range tensor multiplication. In this work, we propose Lightening-Transformer, the first light-empowered, high-performance, and energy-efficient photonic Transformer accelerator. To overcome prior designs' fundamental limitations, we introduce a novel dynamically-operated photonic tensor core, DPTC, a crossbar array of interference-based optical vector dot-product engines supporting highly parallel, dynamic, and full-range matrix multiplication. Furthermore, we design a dedicated accelerator that integrates our novel photonic computing cores with photonic interconnects for inter-core data broadcast, fully unleashing the power of optics. Comprehensive evaluations show that ours achieves >2.6x energy and >12x latency reductions compared to prior photonic accelerators and delivers the lowest energy cost and 2 to 3 orders of magnitude lower energy-delay product compared to electronic Transformer accelerators, all while maintaining digital-comparable accuracy. Our work highlights the immense potential of photonics for advanced ML workloads, such as Transformer-backboned LLM.

A thorough search in recent papers on transformer architectures and attention mechanisms is necessary to determine if similar approaches have been explored. For example, papers on attention mechanisms that focus on improving discriminative power, such as those using contrastive learning or margin-based losses, would be relevant.\n\n- **Dynamic Linear Attention:**\n  - Dynamic linear attention is part of a broader category of efficient attention mechanisms. Previous works like Performer, Linformer, and Reformer have introduced linear or near-linear complexity attention mechanisms. Investigating these works will provide insights into how dynamic linear attention can be implemented and its potential benefits and drawbacks. For instance, the Performer model uses random feature maps to reduce the complexity of attention from quadratic to linear, which could be a useful reference.\n\n## Impact on Accuracy and Robustness\n\n- **Benchmark Performance:**\n  - To assess the impact on accuracy, it is crucial to evaluate the modified model on benchmark datasets such as those used in the GLUE or SuperGLUE benchmarks. Comparing the performance of the enhanced MultiScaleRetention GAU with existing state-of-the-art models will help determine if the modifications lead to improved accuracy and robustness.\n\n- **Robustness to Varied Inputs:**\n  - Testing the model on datasets with varied or noisy inputs, such as those with adversarial examples or out-of-distribution data, will help evaluate its robustness.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/62 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n[15] A. Katharopoulos et al.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention transformers implementation*\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Block-Recurrent Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention transformers implementation*\n\n*DeLesley S. Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code.

Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention transformers implementation*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Dynamic linear attention in RetNet*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. Context-Based Dynamic Pricing with Partially Linear Demand Model\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Dynamic linear attention in RetNet*\n\n*Jinzhi Bu, D. Simchi-Levi, Chong Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The numerical results demonstrate that the learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms, and reveal the effects of parameters d, \u03b2 and \u03b4 on the algorithm\u2019s empirical regret, which are consistent with the theoretical findings.\n\n**Abstract:** In today\u2019s data-rich environment, context-based dynamic pricing has gained much attention. To model the demand as a function of price and context, the existing literature either adopts a parametric model or a non-parametric model. The former is easier to implement but may suffer from model mis-specification, whereas the latter is more robust but does not leverage many structural properties of the underlying problem. This paper combines these two approaches by studying the context-based dynamic pricing with online learning, where the unknown expected demand admits a semi-parametric partially linear structure. Specifically, we consider two demand models, whose expected demand at price p \u2208 R + and context x \u2208 R d is given by bp + g ( x ) and f ( p ) + a \u22a4 x respectively. We assume that g ( x ) is \u03b2 -H\u00f6lder continuous in the first model, and f ( p ) is k th-order smooth with an additional parameter \u03b4 in the second model. For both models, we design an efficient online learning algorithm with provable regret upper bounds, and establish matching lower bounds. This enables us to characterize the statistical complexity for the two learning models, whose optimal regret rates are (cid:101) \u0398( \u221a T \u2228 T d d +2 \u03b2 ) and (cid:101) \u0398( \u221a T \u2228 ( \u03b4T k +1 ) 1 2 k +1 ) respectively. The numerical results demonstrate that our learning algorithms are more effective than benchmark algorithms, and also reveal the effects of parameters d , \u03b2 and \u03b4 on the algorithm\u2019s empirical regret, which are consistent with our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Dynamic linear attention in RetNet*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Efficient attention mechanisms in GAUs*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Neurocache: Efficient Vector Retrieval for Long-range Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Efficient attention mechanisms in GAUs*\n\n*Ali Safaya, Deniz Yuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** Neurocache is an approach to extend the effective context size of large language models (LLMs) using an external vector cache to store its past states using an efficient k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces Neurocache, an approach to extend the effective context size of large language models (LLMs) using an external vector cache to store its past states. Like recent vector retrieval approaches, Neurocache uses an efficient k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm to retrieve relevant past states and incorporate them into the attention process. Neurocache improves upon previous methods by (1) storing compressed states, which reduces cache size; (2) performing a single retrieval operation per token which increases inference speed; and (3) extending the retrieval window to neighboring states, which improves both language modeling and downstream task accuracy. Our experiments show the effectiveness of Neurocache both for models trained from scratch and for pre-trained models such as Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B when enhanced with the cache mechanism. We also compare Neurocache with text retrieval methods and show improvements in single-document question-answering and few-shot learning tasks.

Pushdown Layers: Encoding Recursive Structure in Transformer Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Efficient attention mechanisms in GAUs*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursion is a prominent feature of human language, and fundamentally challenging for self-attention due to the lack of an explicit recursive-state tracking mechanism. Consequently, Transformer language models poorly capture long-tail recursive structure and exhibit sample-inefficient syntactic generalization. This work introduces Pushdown Layers, a new self-attention layer that models recursive state via a stack tape that tracks estimated depths of every token in an incremental parse of the observed prefix. Transformer LMs with Pushdown Layers are syntactic language models that autoregressively and synchronously update this stack tape as they predict new tokens, in turn using the stack tape to softly modulate attention over tokens -- for instance, learning to\"skip\"over closed constituents. When trained on a corpus of strings annotated with silver constituency parses, Transformers equipped with Pushdown Layers achieve dramatically better and 3-5x more sample-efficient syntactic generalization, while maintaining similar perplexities. Pushdown Layers are a drop-in replacement for standard self-attention. We illustrate this by finetuning GPT2-medium with Pushdown Layers on an automatically parsed WikiText-103, leading to improvements on several GLUE text classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key insights and recommendations based on the provided analysis and the search results:\n\n### Max-Margin Token Selection\n\n- The concept of max-margin token selection, as discussed in the analysis, is theoretically supported by works like **Ataee Tarzanagh et al. (2023)**. However, to find empirical implementations, you should search for papers that have applied this concept in practice. For example, you might look into how max-margin token selection has been integrated into transformer architectures and the resulting performance improvements.\n\n### Dynamic Linear Attention\n\n- Dynamic linear attention is a crucial component for reducing computational complexity. Works such as **Yang et al. (2023)** and **Katharopoulos et al. (2020)** provide strong theoretical and empirical foundations for this approach. To further support the integration into RetNet, look for studies that have implemented similar efficient attention mechanisms in other architectures and their impact on performance and efficiency.\n\n### Integration into RetNet and MultiScaleRetention GAUs\n\n- Since there is no direct evidence of prior integration of max-margin token selection or dynamic linear attention into MultiScaleRetention GAUs or RetNet, this proposal is likely novel. You should focus on finding general strategies for integrating new attention mechanisms into existing transformer architectures. For instance, the paper on **HyperAttention** by **Han et al. (2023)** could provide insights into addressing long-context attention efficiently, which might be adaptable to RetNet.\n\n### Empirical Studies and Practical Implementations\n\n- To deepen the empirical understanding, search for studies that have implemented similar mechanisms in other transformer models. For example:\n  - **Yang et al. (2023)**: This work on Gated Linear Attention Transformers provides empirical results on the performance and efficiency of linear attention mechanisms, which could be a valuable reference.\n  - **Anagnostidis et al. (2023)**: This paper on dynamic context pruning offers insights into efficient and interpretable autoregressive transformers, which might be relevant for optimizing the context in RetNet.\n\n### Potential Challenges and Solutions\n\n- Identifying technical challenges in integrating these mechanisms is crucial. Look for papers that discuss the implementation difficulties and proposed solutions. For instance:\n  - **Katharopoulos et al. (2020)**: This work on reformulating self-attention to achieve linear complexity might highlight potential challenges and solutions in practical implementation.\n  - **Han et al. (2023)**: The HyperAttention mechanism discusses how to address the computational challenges of long contexts, which could provide valuable insights into overcoming similar challenges in RetNet.\n\n### Theoretical Foundations and Alignment\n\n- Ensure that the proposed mechanisms align with the theoretical foundations of RetNet. Papers like **Katharopoulos et al. (2020)** and **Yang et al. (2023)** provide theoretical justifications for linear attention mechanisms that can be aligned with RetNet's design principles.\n\n### Specific Search Queries\n\nTo find the most relevant literature, use the following targeted keywords and search descriptions:\n\n```keywords\n1.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/41 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2308.16137, 2023.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 2 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: 1.

TransMatcher: Deep Image Matching Through Transformers for Generalizable Person Re-identification\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Max-margin attention transformer practical implementation*\n\n*Shengcai Liao, Ling Shao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new simplified decoder is proposed, which drops the full attention implementation with the softmax weighting, keeping only the query-key similarity computation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable person re-identification on several popular datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have recently gained increasing attention in computer vision. However, existing studies mostly use Transformers for feature representation learning, e.g. for image classification and dense predictions, and the generalizability of Transformers is unknown. In this work, we further investigate the possibility of applying Transformers for image matching and metric learning given pairs of images. We find that the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the vanilla Transformer with decoders are not adequate for image matching due to their lack of image-to-image attention. Thus, we further design two naive solutions, i.e. query-gallery concatenation in ViT, and query-gallery cross-attention in the vanilla Transformer. The latter improves the performance, but it is still limited. This implies that the attention mechanism in Transformers is primarily designed for global feature aggregation, which is not naturally suitable for image matching. Accordingly, we propose a new simplified decoder, which drops the full attention implementation with the softmax weighting, keeping only the query-key similarity computation. Additionally, global max pooling and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) head are applied to decode the matching result. This way, the simplified decoder is computationally more efficient, while at the same time more effective for image matching. The proposed method, called TransMatcher, achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalizable person re-identification, with up to 6.1% and 5.7% performance gains in Rank-1 and mAP, respectively, on several popular datasets.

FormerTime: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Representations for Multivariate Time Series Classification\n\n*From Search Query: 3. Recent advances in efficient attention mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Enhong Chen, Yucong Luo, Zhi Li, Zhiding Liu, Qi Liu, Mingyue Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning-based algorithms, e.g., convolutional networks, have significantly facilitated multivariate time series classification (MTSC) task. Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on $10$ publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates max-margin token selection and dynamic linear attention within the MultiScaleRetention GAU of RetNet, here are the key insights and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Integration of Max-Margin Token Selection\n\n- The theoretical foundations for max-margin token selection are well-established by works like **Ataee Tarzanagh et al.

While current designs like RetNet have demonstrated significant performance improvements by incorporating mechanisms such as MultiScaleRetention and RetNetMLP, there remains a substantial opportunity to enhance these blocks further. Specifically, improving the discriminative power of attention mechanisms and optimizing computational efficiency are crucial for achieving lower perplexity, higher downstream task accuracy, robustness to varied inputs, and scalability with larger contexts and model sizes. By integrating **max-margin token selection** and **dynamic linear attention** into the MultiScaleRetention GAU, we aim to create a more efficient and effective LM block that surpasses existing state-of-the-art models in performance and scalability.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Max-Margin Attention Mechanisms\n\n*Ataee Tarzanagh et al. (2023)* formalized attention mechanisms as max-margin token selection processes, demonstrating that optimizing query-key parameters via gradient descent leads to solutions that maximize the margin between relevant and irrelevant tokens. This perspective enhances the discriminative capability of attention, ensuring that the model focuses on the most pertinent information within a sequence.\n\n### Dynamic Linear Attention\n\n*You et al. (2024)* introduced augmentation techniques that align linear attention mechanisms with speculative decoding, thereby reducing perplexity and accelerating generation processes. This synergy allows for maintaining the efficiency of linear attention while enhancing its performance, making it highly suitable for scalable LM designs.\n\n### Length Extrapolation and Efficient Context Handling\n\n*Ben-Kish et al. (2024)* proposed DeciMamba, a context-extension method that enables models to handle sequence lengths up to 25 times longer than those seen during training without additional computational costs. This is achieved through a hidden filtering mechanism within the S6 layer, which efficiently compresses and retains essential context information.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n*Yang et al. (2016)* demonstrated the effectiveness of hierarchical attention networks in capturing multi-scale dependencies by processing information at both word and sentence levels. This approach enhances the model's ability to prioritize important content, leading to improved performance in classification and comprehension tasks.\n\n### Compositional Attention\n\n*Mittal et al. (2021)* introduced Compositional Attention, which disentangles search and retrieval within attention heads. This separation allows for dynamic, context-dependent composition of search-retrieval pairs, reducing parameter redundancy and enhancing generalization across tasks.\n\n### Scalable Attention Mechanisms\n\n*Heinsen (2024)* proposed Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token, a modification that linearizes attention computation using exponential kernel feature maps. This approach reduces the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, enabling the processing of longer sequences with minimal computational overhead.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Enhancing Discriminative Power with Max-Margin Token Selection\n\nThe conventional softmax attention mechanism, while effective, often lacks precise discriminative capabilities, potentially leading to attention being distributed over less relevant tokens. By formalizing attention as a max-margin token selection process, we can ensure that the model distinctly separates relevant tokens from irrelevant ones, akin to the margin maximization in Support Vector Machines (SVMs). This enhancement is expected to improve the model's focus on pertinent information, thereby reducing perplexity and enhancing downstream task performance.\n\n### Optimizing Computational Efficiency with Dynamic Linear Attention\n\nTraditional attention mechanisms scale quadratically with sequence length, posing significant computational and memory challenges, especially for long sequences. Dynamic linear attention offers a solution by approximating softmax attention with linear complexity, maintaining efficiency even as sequence lengths grow. Integrating dynamic linear attention within GAUs like MultiScaleRetention will enable the model to handle longer contexts without proportional increases in computational resources, thus enhancing scalability and inference speed.\n\n### Managing Long-Range Dependencies and Context Lengths\n\nHandling long-range dependencies and longer context lengths remains a critical challenge in LLMs. Techniques like DeciMamba's hidden filtering provide efficient context extension, allowing models to process significantly longer sequences without incurring additional computational costs. By incorporating such mechanisms within the MultiScaleRetention GAU, we can ensure that the model retains essential context information while efficiently managing computational resources, thereby improving performance on tasks requiring long-term dependency modeling.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\nIntegrating max-margin token selection and dynamic linear attention introduces additional computational steps within the attention mechanism. However, the expected benefits in terms of improved discriminative power and computational efficiency are anticipated to outweigh the marginal increase in complexity. Careful architectural design and optimization will be essential to balance these trade-offs, ensuring that the overall model remains efficient and scalable.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selection of GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nMultiScaleRetention\n```\n\n### Integration of Max-Margin Token Selection\n\nWe propose modifying the attention scoring mechanism within the MultiScaleRetention GAU to embody a max-margin token selection process. This involves redefining the attention scores to maximize the margin between relevant and irrelevant tokens, thereby enhancing the discriminative power of the attention mechanism.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation\n\nLet \\( Q \\), \\( K \\), and \\( V \\) denote the queries, keys, and values, respectively. The traditional attention scores are computed as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\n\nIncorporating max-margin token selection, we redefine the attention mechanism as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}_{\\text{MaxMargin}}(Q, K, V) = \\exp\\left(\\log\\left(\\frac{\\exp(Q) \\exp(K)^T}{\\exp(c)}\\right)\\right)V\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( c \\) is a scaling constant. By optimizing \\( Q \\) and \\( K \\) to maximize the margin between relevant and irrelevant tokens, the model ensures that attention is concentrated on the most pertinent information.\n\n### Integration of Dynamic Linear Attention\n\nTo further optimize computational efficiency, we integrate dynamic linear attention within the MultiScaleRetention GAU. This modification linearizes the attention computation, reducing the complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to sequence length.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe dynamic linear attention mechanism modifies the softmax attention as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}_{\\text{Linear}}(Q, K, V) = (QK^T)V\n\\]\n\nBy approximating the softmax function with kernel feature maps, the attention computation becomes linear in terms of sequence length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}_{\\text{Linear}}(Q, K, V) = \\phi(Q)(\\phi(K)^TV)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( \\phi \\) represents the kernel feature map used to transform queries and keys. This transformation ensures that the attention mechanism remains computationally efficient even as sequence lengths increase.\n\n### Combined Benefits\n\nIntegrating both max-margin token selection and dynamic linear attention within the MultiScaleRetention GAU offers a dual advantage: enhanced discriminative power and optimized computational efficiency. This combination enables the GAU to focus on the most relevant tokens while maintaining efficient processing of long sequences, thereby improving overall model performance and scalability.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-Code for Modified MultiScaleRetention GAU\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom einops import rearrange\nfrom transformers.activations import ACT2FN\nfrom torchtune.modules import RotaryPositionalEmbeddings, RMSNorm\n\nclass MaxLinMultiScaleRetention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads=8, num_kv_heads=8, \n                 hidden_size=None, norm_eps=1e-05, dropout=0.1, \n                 kernel_dim=64, max_margin=1.0, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size if hidden_size else embed_dim\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.num_kv_heads = num_kv_heads\n        self.kernel_dim = kernel_dim\n        self.max_margin = max_margin\n\n        # Projection layers\n        self.q_proj = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.embed_dim, bias=False)\n        self.k_proj = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.embed_dim, bias=False)\n        self.v_proj = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.embed_dim, bias=False)\n        \n        # Max-Margin parameters\n        self.margin = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(self.max_margin), requires_grad=False)\n\n        # Rotary Positional Embedding\n        self.rotary = RotaryPositionalEmbeddings(dim=self.embed_dim // self.num_heads).to(device=kwargs.get('device'))\n        \n        # Normalization and gating\n        self.g_norm = RMSNorm(self.embed_dim // self.num_heads, eps=norm_eps)\n        self.gate_fn = ACT2FN['swish']\n        \n        # Kernel for Linear Attention\n        self.kernel = nn.Linear(self.embed_dim, self.kernel_dim, bias=False)\n        \n        # Output projections\n        self.o_proj = nn.Linear(self.embed_dim, self.hidden_size, bias=False)\n        \n        # Apply initialization\n        self.apply(self._initialize_weights)\n        \n    def _initialize_weights(self, module):\n        if isinstance(module, nn.Linear):\n            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(module.weight, gain=2 ** -2.5)\n            if module.bias is not None:\n                nn.init.zeros_(module.bias)\n    \n    def forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # Project inputs to queries, keys, and values\n        Q = self.q_proj(X)  # (B, L, D)\n        K = self.k_proj(X)  # (B, L, D)\n        V = self.v_proj(X)  # (B, L, D)\n        \n        # Apply rotary positional embeddings\n        Q = self.rotary(Q)\n        K = self.rotary(K)\n        \n        # Rearrange for multi-head attention\n        Q = rearrange(Q, 'b l (h d) -> b h l d', h=self.num_heads)\n        K = rearrange(K, 'b l (h d) -> b h l d', h=self.num_kv_heads)\n        V = rearrange(V, 'b l (h d) -> b h l d', h=self.num_kv_heads)\n        \n        # Apply max-margin token selection\n        attention_scores = torch.einsum('bhqd,bhkd->bhqk', Q, K) / (self.embed_dim ** 0.5)\n        attention_scores = attention_scores -
