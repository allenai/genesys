LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor (Avg.

Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models.

Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Semantic Compression (Avg.

This constraint restricts their applicability in scenarios involving long texts. We propose a novel semantic compression method that enables generalization to texts that are 6-8 times longer, without incurring significant computational costs or requiring fine-tuning. Our proposed framework draws inspiration from source coding in information theory and employs a pre-trained model to reduce the semantic redundancy of long inputs before passing them to the LLMs for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively extends the context window of LLMs across a range of tasks including question answering, summarization, few-shot learning, and information retrieval. Furthermore, the proposed semantic compression method exhibits consistent fluency in text generation while reducing the associated computational overhead.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nURL https://doi.org/10.5281/ zenodo. 5196577 .

FlashAttention: Fast and memory-efficient exact attention with IO-awareness.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1803.05457, 2018.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Multi-Domain Dialogue State Tracking with Disentangled Domain-Slot Attention\n\n*From Search Query: long context multi-head attention*\n\n*Longfei Yang, Jiyi Li, Sheng Li, T. Shinozaki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes disentangled domain-slot attention for multi-domain dialogue state tracking and demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms the standard multi-head attention with aggregated domain-slot query.\n\n**Abstract:** As the core of task-oriented dialogue systems, dialogue state tracking (DST) is designed to track the dialogue state through the conversation between users and systems. Multi-domain DST has been an important challenge in which the dialogue states across multiple domains need to consider. In recent mainstream approaches, each domain and slot are aggregated and regarded as a single query feeding into attention with the dialogue history to obtain domain-slot specific representations. In this work, we propose disentangled domain-slot attention for multi-domain dialogue state tracking. The proposed approach disentangles the domain-slot specific information extraction in a flexible and context-dependent manner by sep-arating the query about domains and slots in the attention component. Through a series of experiments on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the standard multi-head attention with aggregated domain-slot query.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Memorization Capacity of Multi-Head Attention in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: long context multi-head attention*\n\n*Sadegh Mahdavi, Renjie Liao, Christos Thrampoulidis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the memorization abilities of multi-head attention mechanisms, examining how many example sequences they can memorize, as a function of the number of heads and sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become the go-to architecture for language and vision tasks, yet their theoretical properties, especially memorization capacity, remain elusive. This paper investigates the memorization abilities of multi-head attention mechanisms, examining how many example sequences they can memorize, as a function of the number of heads and sequence length. Motivated by experimental findings on vision transformers, we introduce novel assumptions about the linear independence of input data, distinct from the commonly used general-position assumption. Under these assumptions, we demonstrate that an attention layer with $H$ heads, dimension $d$, and context size $n<d$, featuring $\\Theta(Hd^2)$ parameters, can memorize $\\Omega(Hn)$ examples. Our analysis sheds light on how different attention heads handle various example sequences, aided by the softmax operator's saturation property.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: long context multi-head attention*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Brian DuSell, David Chiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty and is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention, specifically scaled dot-product attention, has proven effective for natural language, but it does not have a mechanism for handling hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth, which limits its ability to recognize certain syntactic structures. To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget, and we include results on machine translation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. An Exploration of Hierarchical Attention Transformers for Efficient Long\n  Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Ilias Chalkidis, Xiang Dai, Manos Fergadiotis, Prodromos Malakasiotis, Desmond Elliott*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-hierarchical sparse attention Transformer-based models, such as\nLongformer and Big Bird, are popular approaches to working with long documents.\nThere are clear benefits to these approaches compared to the original\nTransformer in terms of efficiency, but Hierarchical Attention Transformer\n(HAT) models are a vastly understudied alternative. We develop and release\nfully pre-trained HAT models that use segment-wise followed by cross-segment\nencoders and compare them with Longformer models and partially pre-trained\nHATs. In several long document downstream classification tasks, our best HAT\nmodel outperforms equally-sized Longformer models while using 10-20% less GPU\nmemory and processing documents 40-45% faster. In a series of ablation studies,\nwe find that HATs perform best with cross-segment contextualization throughout\nthe model than alternative configurations that implement either early or late\ncross-segment contextualization.

LSTM-based Deep Learning Models for Non-factoid Answer Selection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ming Tan, Cicero dos Santos, Bing Xiang, Bowen Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we apply a general deep learning (DL) framework for the answer\nselection task, which does not depend on manually defined features or\nlinguistic tools. The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions\nand answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and\nmeasure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic\nmodel in two directions. One direction is to define a more composite\nrepresentation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural\nnetwork with the basic framework. The other direction is to utilize a simple\nbut efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer\nrepresentation according to the question context.

Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has\npushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to\naddress high computational requirements and limited input sequence length.\nDespite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the\nintersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of\nmodel compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention\ntransformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of\nstate-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in\nperformance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train\nand test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that\ndistilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of\noriginal model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks\n(GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context\nQuestion-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on\nlong-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference\ntimes by up to 57.8%.

LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor\n\n*From Search Query: long context multi-head attention*\n\n*Xuanjing Huang, Qi Zhang, Tao Gui, Tao Ji, Jun Zhao, wei he, Xin Zhou, Yi Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands. Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models. We release our code at https://github.com/LuLuLuyi/LongHeads .\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Positional Interpolation\n\n*From Search Query: long context multi-head attention*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Liangjian Chen, Sherman Wong, Shouyuan Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Position Interpolation (PI) that extends the context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained LLMs such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal fine-tuning (within 1000 steps), while demonstrating strong empirical results on various tasks that require long context, including passkey retrieval, language modeling, and long document summarization from LLaMA 7B to 65B. Meanwhile, the extended model by Position Interpolation preserve quality relatively well on tasks within its original context window. To achieve this goal, Position Interpolation linearly down-scales the input position indices to match the original context window size, rather than extrapolating beyond the trained context length which may lead to catastrophically high attention scores that completely ruin the self-attention mechanism. Our theoretical study shows that the upper bound of interpolation is at least $\\sim 600 \\times$ smaller than that of extrapolation, further demonstrating its stability. Models extended via Position Interpolation retain its original architecture and can reuse most pre-existing optimization and infrastructure.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. FasterViT: Fast Vision Transformers with Hierarchical Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Pavlo Molchanov, Jan Kautz, Jose M. Alvarez, Andrew Tao, Hongxu Yin, Greg Heinrich, Ali Hatamizadeh*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a new family of hybrid CNN-ViT neural networks, named FasterViT, with a focus on high image throughput for computer vision (CV) applications. FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Slide-Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Local Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Zhuofan Xia, Tianzhu Ye, Xuran Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the recent progress of Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global contexts. However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of improving Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanisms to handle long-context sequences efficiently, here are some key insights and references that align with the researcher's intents:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Tensorized Attention**: This approach, described in, involves tensorizing long input sequences into compact tensor representations followed by attention on each transformed dimension. This method hierarchically captures multi-hop token interactions, extending the effective context length efficiently. It could be integrated into the MHA unit to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n## Selective Attention and Chunking Strategies\n\n- **DuoAttention**: This mechanism, outlined in, categorizes attention heads into Retrieval Heads and Streaming Heads. Retrieval Heads focus on maintaining crucial context over the entire input, while Streaming Heads manage short-term dependencies. This selective attention approach can be adapted to the MHA unit to extend its context handling capabilities efficiently.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP)**: As described in, USP combines the strengths of DeepSpeed-Ulysses-Attention and Ring-Attention to achieve better performance and efficiency in long-context modeling. This hybrid approach could be explored to optimize the MHA unit for parallel processing and reduced computational overhead.\n\n## Enhanced Relative Positional Encoding\n\n- **Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions (FIRE)**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided sources, the concept of enhanced relative positional encoding, similar to what is proposed in the analysis note, can be crucial. FIRE, as mentioned in the analysis, improves generalization to longer contexts by interpolating positional information, which could be a valuable enhancement for the MHA unit.\n\n## Key References and Insights\n\n### DuoAttention\n- **DuoAttention** optimizes long-context LLMs by distinguishing between Retrieval and Streaming Heads, reducing memory usage and speeding up processing. This approach can be adapted to the MHA unit to selectively focus on critical and less critical details, enhancing efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Tensorized Attention\n- **Tensorized Attention** extends the attention receptive field by tensorizing long input sequences, allowing for more efficient handling of long-range dependencies. This method can be integrated into existing LLMs to improve efficiency and length extrapolation performance.\n\n### Unified Sequence Parallelism (USP)\n- **USP** synergizes the strengths of different distributed attentions, providing a more general and stronger versatility and better performance. This approach can help in optimizing the MHA unit for parallel processing and reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: DuoAttention and USP both offer methods to reduce memory demands, which is crucial for handling long-context sequences efficiently. Implementing these strategies within the MHA unit can help in maintaining or improving upon the efficiency of the original model.\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Tensorized Attention and hierarchical attention mechanisms can be combined to create a layered approach where different heads or layers handle different scales of information. This can enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies without increasing computational complexity significantly.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Literature on Hierarchical Attention**: Investigate recent papers on hierarchical attention mechanisms, such as Hierarchical Transformers or Multi-Scale Attention Networks, to gather more insights on scalable attention mechanisms for long sequences.\n\n- **Implementation Examples**: Search for open-source implementations of DuoAttention, USP, or similar approaches to understand practical integration challenges and feasibility within the GPT-2 architecture.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel MHA block that efficiently handles long-context sequences, enhances scalability, and maintains computational efficiency.\n",

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods.

However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 2321-2329, 2014.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1904.10631, 2019.

Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chen Huang, Walter A. Talbott, N. Jaitly, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, this paper learns to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer, and makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise attention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Feature Abstraction for Translating Video to Language\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yunchen Pu, Martin Renqiang Min, Zhe Gan, L.

We consider both \"hard\" and \"soft\" attention mechanisms, to adaptively and sequentially focus on different layers of features (levels of feature \"abstraction\"), as well as local spatiotemporal regions of the feature maps at each layer. The proposed approach is evaluated on three benchmark datasets: YouTube2Text, M-VAD and MSR-VTT. Along with visualizing the results and how the model works, these experiments quantitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive spatiotemporal feature abstraction for translating videos to sentences with rich semantics.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chenwei Xu, Yu-Chao Huang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weijian Li, Ammar Gilani, H. Goan, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The BiSHop framework, a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning, is introduced, demonstrating that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the \\textbf{B}i-Directional \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{Hop}field Network (\\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1355  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 5. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Unlimiformer: Long-Range Transformers with Unlimited Length Input\n\n*From Search Query: long-range transformers*\n\n*Amanda Bertsch, Uri Alon, Graham Neubig, Matthew R. Gormley*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores.\n\n**Abstract:** Since the proposal of transformers, these models have been limited to bounded input lengths, because of their need to attend to every token in the input. In this work, we propose Unlimiformer: a general approach that wraps any existing pretrained encoder-decoder transformer, and offloads the cross-attention computation to a single k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) index, while the returned kNN distances are the attention dot-product scores. This kNN index can be kept on either the GPU or CPU memory and queried in sub-linear time; this way, we can index practically unlimited input sequences, while every attention head in every decoder layer retrieves its top-k keys, instead of attending to every key. We evaluate Unlimiformer on several long-document and book-summarization benchmarks, showing that it can process even 500k token-long inputs from the BookSum dataset, without any input truncation at test time. We demonstrate that Unlimiformer improves pretrained models such as BART and Longformer by extending them to unlimited inputs without additional learned weights and without modifying their code. We make our code and models publicly available at https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer .\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 98  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 8.

Sanghai*\n\n**TL;DR:** CoLT5 is proposed, a long-input Transformer model that builds on intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers, and achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 9. Efficient Long-Range Transformers: You Need to Attend More, but Not Necessarily at Every Layer\n\n*From Search Query: long-range transformers*\n\n*Qingru Zhang, Dhananjay Ram, Cole Hawkins, Sheng Zha, Tuo Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans, is proposed, which is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. These models leverage the attention mechanism to capture long- and short-range dependencies in the sequence. However, the (full) attention mechanism incurs high computational cost - quadratic in the sequence length, which is not affordable in tasks with long sequences, e.g., inputs with 8k tokens. Although sparse attention can be used to improve computational efficiency, as suggested in existing work, it has limited modeling capacity and often fails to capture complicated dependencies in long sequences. To tackle this challenge, we propose MASFormer, an easy-to-implement transformer variant with Mixed Attention Spans. Specifically, MASFormer is equipped with full attention to capture long-range dependencies, but only at a small number of layers. For the remaining layers, MASformer only employs sparse attention to capture short-range dependencies. Our experiments on natural language modeling and generation tasks show that a decoder-only MASFormer model of 1.3B parameters can achieve competitive performance to vanilla transformers with full attention while significantly reducing computational cost (up to 75%). Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of continual training with long sequence data and how sequence length impacts downstream generation performance, which may be of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Explain and Improve: LRP-Inference Fine-Tuning for Image Captioning\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamei Sun, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the predictions of image captioning models with attention\nmechanisms beyond visualizing the attention itself. We develop variants of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and gradient-based explanation methods,\ntailored to image captioning models with attention mechanisms. We compare the\ninterpretability of attention heatmaps systematically against the explanations\nprovided by explanation methods such as LRP, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM. We\nshow that explanation methods provide simultaneously pixel-wise image\nexplanations (supporting and opposing pixels of the input image) and linguistic\nexplanations (supporting and opposing words of the preceding sequence) for each\nword in the predicted captions. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that\nexplanation methods 1) can reveal additional evidence used by the model to make\ndecisions compared to attention; 2) correlate to object locations with high\nprecision; 3) are helpful to \"debug\" the model, e.g. by analyzing the reasons\nfor hallucinated object words.

Density Adaptive Attention is All You Need: Robust Parameter-Efficient\n  Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a\nnovel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer\n(DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities,\nincluding Speech, Text, and Vision. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance\ninto its attention mechanism, implemented in a multi-head framework, enabling\nit to collectively model any probability distribution for dynamic recalibration\nof feature significance. This method demonstrates significant improvements,\nespecially with highly non-stationary data, surpassing the state-of-the-art\nattention techniques in model performance, up to approximately +20% (abs.) in\naccuracy. Empirically, DAAM exhibits superior adaptability and efficacy across\na diverse range of tasks, including emotion recognition in speech, image\nclassification, and text classification, thereby establishing its robustness\nand versatility in handling data across multiple modalities. Furthermore, we\nintroduce the Importance Factor, a new learning-based metric that enhances the\nexplainability of models trained with DAAM-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-20T06:42:32Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-29T00:45:46Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. AOE-Net: Entities Interactions Modeling with Adaptive Attention Mechanism for Temporal Action Proposals Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ngan Le, Minh-Triet Tran, Bhiksha Raj, Kashu Yamazaki, Sang Truong, Khoa Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task, which requires localizing action intervals in an untrimmed video. Intuitively, we as humans, perceive an action through the interactions between actors, relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Despite the significant progress of TAPG, a vast majority of existing methods ignore the aforementioned principle of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e., perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset.

EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

BP-Transformer: Modelling Long-Range Context via Binary Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: long-range transformers*\n\n*Zihao Ye, Qipeng Guo, Xipeng Qiu, Quan Gan, Zheng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer model is widely successful on many natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models. Our code, hyperparameters and CUDA kernels for sparse attention are available in PyTorch.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to modify the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism in the GPT-2 architecture to improve its efficiency and scalability, particularly for handling long-context sequences.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022. Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nTrans.

It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code. Our code has been released as open source.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/53 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nZong, F. Xia, W. Li, and R. Navigli, eds.), 2021. [13] H. Ren, H. Dai, Z. Dai, M. Yang, J.

Multi-Domain Neural Machine Translation with Word-Level Adaptive Layer-wise Domain Mixing\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-head attention*\n\n*Haoming Jiang, Chen Liang, Chong Wang, T. Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel multi-domain NMT model using individual modules for each domain, on which word-level, adaptive and layer-wise domain mixing is applied, which can achieve effective domain knowledge sharing and capture fine-grained domain-specific knowledge as well.\n\n**Abstract:** Many multi-domain neural machine translation (NMT) models achieve knowledge transfer by enforcing one encoder to learn shared embedding across domains. However, this design lacks adaptation to individual domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-domain NMT model using individual modules for each domain, on which we apply word-level, adaptive and layer-wise domain mixing. We first observe that words in a sentence are often related to multiple domains. Hence, we assume each word has a domain proportion, which indicates its domain preference. Then word representations are obtained by mixing their embedding in individual domains based on their domain proportions. We show this can be achieved by carefully designing multi-head dot-product attention modules for different domains, and eventually taking weighted averages of their parameters by word-level layer-wise domain proportions. Through this, we can achieve effective domain knowledge sharing and capture fine-grained domain-specific knowledge as well. Our experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing ones in several NMT tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. iACOS: Advancing Implicit Sentiment Extraction with Informative and Adaptive Negative Examples\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-head attention*\n\n*Xiancai Xu, Jia-Dong Zhang, Lei Xiong, Zhishang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** iACOS appends two implicit tokens at the end of a text to capture the context-aware representation of all tokens including implicit aspects and opinions and leverages informative and adaptive negative examples to jointly train the multi-label classifier and the other two classifiers on categories and sentiments by multi-task learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) have been extensively studied, but little light has been shed on the quadruple extraction consisting of four fundamental elements: aspects, categories, opinions and sentiments, especially with implicit aspects and opinions. In this paper, we propose a new method iACOS for extracting Implicit Aspects with Categories and Opinions with Sentiments. First, iACOS appends two implicit tokens at the end of a text to capture the context-aware representation of all tokens including implicit aspects and opinions. Second, iACOS develops a sequence labeling model over the context-aware token representation to co-extract explicit and implicit aspects and opinions. Third, iACOS devises a multi-label classifier with a specialized multi-head attention for discovering aspect-opinion pairs and predicting their categories and sentiments simultaneously. Fourth, iACOS leverages informative and adaptive negative examples to jointly train the multi-label classifier and the other two classifiers on categories and sentiments by multi-task learning. Finally, the experimental results show that iACOS significantly outperforms other quadruple extraction baselines according to the F1 score on two public benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Language Model Augmented Monotonic Attention for Simultaneous Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-head attention*\n\n*S. Indurthi, Mohd Abbas Zaidi, Beomseok Lee, Nikhil Kumar Lakumarapu, Sangha Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments on MuST-C English-German and English-French speech-to-text translation tasks show the future information from the language model improves the state-of-the-art monotonic multi-head attention model further.\n\n**Abstract:** The state-of-the-art adaptive policies for Simultaneous Neural Machine Translation (SNMT) use monotonic attention to perform read/write decisions based on the partial source and target sequences. The lack of sufficient information might cause the monotonic attention to take poor read/write decisions, which in turn negatively affects the performance of the SNMT model. On the other hand, human translators make better read/write decisions since they can anticipate the immediate future words using linguistic information and domain knowledge. In this work, we propose a framework to aid monotonic attention with an external language model to improve its decisions. Experiments on MuST-C English-German and English-French speech-to-text translation tasks show the future information from the language model improves the state-of-the-art monotonic multi-head attention model further.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. CoLT5: Faster Long-Range Transformers with Conditional Computation\n\n*From Search Query: conditional computation transformers*\n\n*J. Ainslie, Tao Lei, Michiel de Jong, Santiago Ontan'on, Siddhartha Brahma, Yury Zemlyanskiy, David C. Uthus, Mandy Guo, J. Lee-Thorp, Yi Tay, Yun-Hsuan Sung, Sumit K. Sanghai*\n\n**TL;DR:** CoLT5 is proposed, a long-input Transformer model that builds on intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers, and achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing tasks benefit from long inputs, but processing long documents with Transformers is expensive -- not only due to quadratic attention complexity but also from applying feedforward and projection layers to every token. However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Single-Stage Visual Relationship Learning using Conditional Queries\n\n*From Search Query: conditional computation transformers*\n\n*Alakh Desai, Tz-Ying Wu, Subarna Tripathi, N. Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that TraCQ not only outperforms existing single-stage scene graph generation methods, it also beats many state-of-the-art two-stage methods on the Visual Genome dataset, yet is capable of end-to-end training and faster inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Research in scene graph generation (SGG) usually considers two-stage models, that is, detecting a set of entities, followed by combining them and labeling all possible relationships. While showing promising results, the pipeline structure induces large parameter and computation overhead, and typically hinders end-to-end optimizations. To address this, recent research attempts to train single-stage models that are computationally efficient. With the advent of DETR, a set based detection model, one-stage models attempt to predict a set of subject-predicate-object triplets directly in a single shot. However, SGG is inherently a multi-task learning problem that requires modeling entity and predicate distributions simultaneously. In this paper, we propose Transformers with conditional queries for SGG, namely, TraCQ with a new formulation for SGG that avoids the multi-task learning problem and the combinatorial entity pair distribution. We employ a DETR-based encoder-decoder design and leverage conditional queries to significantly reduce the entity label space as well, which leads to 20% fewer parameters compared to state-of-the-art single-stage models. Experimental results show that TraCQ not only outperforms existing single-stage scene graph generation methods, it also beats many state-of-the-art two-stage methods on the Visual Genome dataset, yet is capable of end-to-end training and faster inference.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. HAHE: Hierarchical Attention for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs in Global and Local Level\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*Haoran Luo, E. Haihong, Yuhao Yang, Yikai Guo, Mingzhi Sun, Tianyu Yao, Zichen Tang, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention, that addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Link Prediction on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKG) is a worthwhile endeavor. HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectively represent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKG can be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semantic sequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs\u2019 representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

AMR Parsing with Causal Hierarchical Attention and Pointers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*Chao Lou, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model is introduced, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder, and which outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Abstract:** Translation-based AMR parsers have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: conditional computation transformers*\n\n*Ankur Bapna, Naveen Arivazhagan, Orhan Firat*\n\n**Abstract:** Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example\nindependent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that\nadapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed\ninference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external\ncomputational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we\nutilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer)\nmore efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the\nTransformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally\nexecutable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train\nthis model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular\ncomputation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be\ncontrolled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off\ncurve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We\nevaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii)\nUnsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that\nthe proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with\nvanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget,\nwhile improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when\noperating on smaller computational budgets.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-17T17:54:27Z  (*Updated: 2020-04-16T15:01:45Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Disentangling Structure and Style: Political Bias Detection in News by\n  Inducing Document Hierarchy\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*Jiwoo Hong, Yejin Cho, Jaemin Jung, Jiyoung Han, James Thorne*\n\n**Abstract:** We address an important gap in detecting political bias in news articles.\nPrevious works that perform document classification can be influenced by the\nwriting style of each news outlet, leading to overfitting and limited\ngeneralizability. Our approach overcomes this limitation by considering both\nthe sentence-level semantics and the document-level rhetorical structure,\nresulting in a more robust and style-agnostic approach to detecting political\nbias in news articles. We introduce a novel multi-head hierarchical attention\nmodel that effectively encodes the structure of long documents through a\ndiverse ensemble of attention heads. While journalism follows a formalized\nrhetorical structure, the writing style may vary by news outlet. We demonstrate\nthat our method overcomes this domain dependency and outperforms previous\napproaches for robustness and accuracy.

Induction and Reference of Entities in a Visual Story\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*Ruo-Ping Dong, Khyathi Raghavi Chandu, Alan W Black*\n\n**Abstract:** We are enveloped by stories of visual interpretations in our everyday lives.\nThe way we narrate a story often comprises of two stages, which are, forming a\ncentral mind map of entities and then weaving a story around them. A\ncontributing factor to coherence is not just basing the story on these entities\nbut also, referring to them using appropriate terms to avoid repetition. In\nthis paper, we address these two stages of introducing the right entities at\nseemingly reasonable junctures and also referring them coherently in the\ncontext of visual storytelling. The building blocks of the central mind map,\nalso known as entity skeleton are entity chains including nominal and\ncoreference expressions. This entity skeleton is also represented in different\nlevels of abstractions to compose a generalized frame to weave the story. We\nbuild upon an encoder-decoder framework to penalize the model when the decoded\nstory does not adhere to this entity skeleton. We establish a strong baseline\nfor skeleton informed generation and then extend this to have the capability of\nmultitasking by predicting the skeleton in addition to generating the story.\nFinally, we build upon this model and propose a glocal hierarchical attention\nmodel that attends to the skeleton both at the sentence (local) and the story\n(global) levels. We observe that our proposed models outperform the baseline in\nterms of automatic evaluation metric, METEOR. We perform various analysis\ntargeted to evaluate the performance of our task of enforcing the entity\nskeleton such as the number and diversity of the entities generated. We also\nconduct human evaluation from which it is concluded that the visual stories\ngenerated by our model are preferred 82% of the times. In addition, we show\nthat our glocal hierarchical attention model improves coherence by introducing\nmore pronouns as required by the presence of nouns.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-15T01:09:01Z  (*Updated: 2019-09-15T01:09:01Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

A Dual Input-aware Factorization Machine for CTR Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-head attention*\n\n*Bo, Chenhui and Yuan, Zhen and Li, Yongzhe and Wang, Yantao and Chang, Wantong and Yu, Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** Factorization Machines (FMs) refer to a class of general predictors working with real valued feature vectors, which are well-known for their ability to estimate model parameters under significant sparsity and have found successful applications in many areas such as the click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, standard FMs only produce a single fixed representation for each feature across different input instances, which may limit the CTR model\u2019s expressive and predictive power. Inspired by the success of Input-aware Factorization Machines (IFMs), which aim to learn more flexible and informative representations of a given feature according to different input instances, we propose a novel model named Dual Input-aware Factorization Machines (DIFMs) that can adaptively reweight the original feature representations at the bit-wise and vector-wise levels simultaneously. Furthermore, DIFMs strategically integrate various components including Multi-Head Self-Attention, Residual Networks and DNNs into a unified end-to-end model. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world CTR prediction datasets show that the DIFM model can outperform several state-of-the-art models consistently.\n\n**Proceeding:** ijcai-2020-7\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: conditional computation transformers*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Hierarchical Self-Attentive Model for Recommending User-Generated Item Lists\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*Wei Niu, Jianling Wang, Yun He, James Caverlee*\n\n**Abstract:** User-generated item lists are a popular feature of many different platforms. Examples include lists of books on Goodreads, playlists on Spotify and YouTube, collections of images on Pinterest, and lists of answers on question-answer sites like Zhihu. Recommending item lists is critical for increasing user engagement and connecting users to new items, but many approaches are designed for the item-based recommendation, without careful consideration of the complex relationships between items and lists. Hence, in this paper, we propose a novel user-generated list recommendation model called AttList. Two unique features of AttList are careful modeling of (i) hierarchical user preference, which aggregates items to characterize the list that they belong to, and then aggregates these lists to estimate the user preference, naturally fitting into the hierarchical structure of item lists; and (ii) item and list consistency, through a novel self-attentive aggregation layer designed for capturing the consistency of neighboring items and lists to better model user preference. Through experiments over three real-world datasets reflecting different kinds of user-generated item lists, we find that AttList results in significant improvements in NDCG, Precision@k, and Recall@k versus a suite of state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, all code and data are available at https://github.com/heyunh2015/AttList.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-30\n\n\n\n#### 6. Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention models*\n\n*David Chiang, Brian DuSell*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention, specifically scaled dot-product attention, has proven effective for natural language, but it does not have a mechanism for handling hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth, which limits its ability to recognize certain syntactic structures. To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget, and we include results on machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to enhance the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism in the GPT-2 architecture to improve its efficiency and scalability, particularly for handling long-context sequences. Here are the key points and the most relevant information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: The researcher is interested in methods that dynamically adjust attention based on input complexity or token importance. This can be achieved through:\n  - **Conditional Computation**: Models like **CoLT5** employ conditional computation, where more resources are devoted to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. This approach can significantly improve efficiency and performance.\n  - **Adaptive Context Pooling**: Techniques such as **ContextPool** learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention, allowing the model to encode meaningful context with varying scale.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Transformers\n\n- **Optimized Attention Algorithms**: To reduce memory usage, the researcher can consider:\n  - **FlashAttention**: This algorithm optimizes memory access patterns, reducing the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory and on-chip SRAM, making it faster and more memory-efficient.\n  - **Reformer**: This model replaces dot-product attention with locality-sensitive hashing, changing the complexity from \\(O(L^2)\\) to \\(O(L \\log L)\\), making it more memory-efficient and faster on long sequences.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing within Attention\n\n- **Multi-Scale Attention**: Implementing hierarchical structures within the attention mechanism can capture both local and global dependencies efficiently. For example:\n  - **BP-Transformer**: This model uses binary partitioning to operate attention over spans of varying lengths, providing a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity.\n  - **Tensorized Attention**: This approach converts long-range interactions into short-range interactions along each dimension, enabling the model to handle longer sequences with improved memory and time efficiency.\n\n### Combined Approaches\n\n- **Integrating Adaptive Computation and Hierarchical Processing**: Combining adaptive computation with hierarchical attention can be highly effective. For instance, important tokens identified through adaptive mechanisms could be propagated through higher-level attention layers, ensuring efficient and scalable processing of long sequences.\n  - **Unlimiformer**: While not specifically adaptive, this model offloads cross-attention computation to a kNN index, allowing it to handle unlimited input lengths without additional learned weights, which can be combined with adaptive mechanisms for further efficiency.\n\n### Key Insights and Implementation\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Techniques like **FlashAttention** and **Reformer** can significantly reduce memory usage and computational cost, enabling the model to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: Models such as **BP-Transformer** and the proposed **Tensorized Attention** can capture long-range dependencies efficiently by introducing hierarchical structures within the attention mechanism.\n- **Adaptive Mechanisms**: Implementing adaptive computation as in **CoLT5** and **ContextPool** can ensure that the model focuses computational resources on the most important tokens or regions, enhancing both efficiency and performance.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into Adaptive Computation Methods**: Investigate how adaptive computation can be integrated into MHA without significant overhead. Explore models that implement conditional computation within attention mechanisms.\n- **Assess Implementation Feasibility**: Evaluate the practical aspects of incorporating hierarchical structures and adaptive mechanisms into the GPT-2 MHA unit, considering potential challenges such as increased code complexity or training instability.\n- **Review Training and Fine-Tuning Considerations**: Determine whether the proposed changes can utilize existing pre-trained weights or require training from scratch. Explore necessary adjustments to training procedures.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n- **FlashAttention**: Dao, T., Fu, D. Y., Ermon, S., et al.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

LM-Infinite: Zero-Shot Extreme Length Generalization for Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Chi Han, Qifan Wang, Hao Peng, Wenhan Xiong, Yu Chen, Heng Ji, Sinong Wang*\n\n**Published in:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LM-Infinite is a simple and effective method for enhancing LLMs\u2019 capabilities of handling long contexts, which allows LLMs pre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to generalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining perplexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Today\u2019s large language models (LLMs) typically train on short text segments (e.g., <4K tokens) due to the quadratic complexity of their Transformer architectures. As a result, their performance suffers drastically on inputs longer than those encountered during training, substantially limiting their applications in real-world tasks involving long contexts such as encod- ing scientific articles, code repositories, or long dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, this work identifies three major factors contributing to this length generalization failure. Our theoretical analysis reveals that commonly used techniques like using a sliding-window attention pattern or relative positional encodings are inadequate to address them. Answering these challenges, we propose LM-Infinite, a simple and effective method for enhancing LLMs\u2019 capabilities of handling long contexts. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and can be used with most modern LLMs off-the-shelf. Without any parameter updates, it allows LLMs pre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to generalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining perplexity. It also improves performance on downstream tasks such as Passkey Retrieval and Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves 2.7\u00d7 decoding speed up and 7.5\u00d7 memory saving over the original model. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proc.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/40 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nWe refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020) for a more detailed analysis of different transformer variants. Additional Inductive Biases. While a lot of the above transformer variations are designed to prevent the quadratic bottleneck, most of them also add certain additional inductive biases in the model. For example, the addition of sparsity not only reduces the computational complexity but also adds the additional inductive bias of sparse information routing between different elements. There are certain additional variants (Lamb et al., 2021; Goyal et al., 2021b) that add other inductive biases, eg. factorized state space and global workspace bottleneck respectively in the transformer model. ## A. 3 MODULARITY, COMPOSITIONALITY, REUSABILITY AND BOTTLENECK\n\nThere have been recent efforts along the lines of modularized computations in an effort to improve the model's capacity to perform systematic generalization. In particular, humans are able to compartmentalize information and act on it in a disentangled, context-driven and robust fashion. These cognitive fundamentals have led to a preliminary movement of Machine Learning systems into this space. We discuss some of the essential ingredients below. Modularity. Modularity refers to factorization of knowledge into smaller components that can independently exist and act on sensory information. It can be considered as disentangled representations that allow for interventions on these different components or factorized mechanisms where each mechanism has a specific purpose and can act on a part or whole of the sensory information. The fundamental aim of modularity is to prevent unrestricted information flow across a whole monolitihic system and instead to learn in an often end-to-end fashion factorized representations and mechanisms that act on these representations. Recent works (Goyal et al., 2019; 2020; 2021a; Mittal et al., 2020; Madan et al., 2021; Lamb et al., 2021; Ke et al., 2021) along the lines of factorizing knowledge demonstrate that it often leads to increased robustness and better OoD performance. Compositionality and Reusability. Humans are able to perform complex tasks even in novel and unknown situations. This capacity often stems from the fact that our complex actions are in reality compositions of simpler primitives and our understanding of these primitives is so good that we are able to dynamically combine these primitives into novel complex actions. Recent research has started looking into tasks and systems that test and allow for compositional generalization (Lake \\& Baroni, 2018a; Li et al., 2019; Keysers et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Hupkes et al., 2020; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020), which is generalization to novel combinations of the underlying primitives/mechanisms. The primary reason why a number of modular systems are constructed in recurrent domains is because we want the factorized mechanisms to be reusable in a number of scenarios. Reusability of knowledge (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019) allows for learning of disentangled mechanisms in a modular system which then has the potential to lead to efficient compositions of the learned disentangled mechanisms. Recent success of systems that use computations that can be reused multiple times demonstrates that reusability is actually an important fundamental for obtaining compositionality. Bottleneck. Conscious attention in humans is a key ingredient to create a bottleneck of information processing, according to the Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene et al., 2017). The key use of this bottleneck is to restrict information flow across the whole network, human brain or otherwise, which allows for robustness to insignificant pieces of sensory information. The usefulness of this bottleneck has been hypothesized to be linked to the sparsity and simplicity of the dependencies manipulated with System 2 cognition (Bengio, 2017; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020). Recent works along these lines (Goyal et al., 2021b) illustrate that modular systems with the addition of a bottleneck efficiently factorize computations and then compose them in a dynamic and context dependent fashion often lead to improved performance, faster adaptation and systematic generalization (Bengio et al., 2019; Ke et al., 2021). ## B PROPOSED MODEL\n\nIn this section, we provide additional details about the general motivation, architecture setup and our argument for using parameter sharing across layers. We further provide details about computational complexity of the proposed model and some ablations that we consider. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=473&width=1392&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=364)\n\nFigure 8: Performance on Contextual Retrieval Task. We compare our proposed model against standard Multi-Head attention (lower loss is better) on various setups of the task. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. ## B. 1 MotivATION\n\nWhile the setting in Figure 1 may look idealistic in the sense that it is very likely that transformer heads do not learn this interpretable single feature functions for search and retrieval, we argue that this rigidity still exists between search and retrieval in a standard multi-head attention framework. To see this, we note that the search component Search $_{h}$, is parameterized by the query and key matrices $W_{q_{h}}$ and $W_{k_{h}}$ respectively and the retrieval component Retrieval ${ }_{h}$ is parameterized by the value matrices $W_{v_{h}}$. Both these components lead to computations that are dynamic based on the input but\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=45&width=1386&top_left_y=1227&top_left_x=367) (notice the same $h$ subscript), also highlighted in Equation 5. Thus, whenever there is a need to share retrieval parameterizations across multiple searches, a standard multi-head attention would lead to learning of redundancies because there is no notion of sharing of retrievals between searches. Contrasting this with the proposed approach, Compositional Attention, we see that now there is a notion of sharing of retrievals for different searches. That is, two different searches can still opt for the same retrieval parameterization, which alleviates the rigidity and redundancy that is explained above. Note that this discussion does not depend on the model's capacity to selectively pick features as is illustrated in Figure 1. This shows that irrespective of what these searches and retrievals learn, the discussed drawbacks of multi-head attention still exist if an optimal solution requires sharing of retrievals across searches. We highlight the motivation through the idealistic example of multiple features solely for ease of explanation and appealing to the fundamental cognitively inspired inductive bias that we try to incorporate. We emphasize that multi-head attention and the proposed compositional attention are not two separate classes of methods. In fact, our proposed mechanism is a strict superset of multi-head attention and thus presents a more general framework that subsumes the family of multi-head attention. One can see this from Equation 13 where, given enough capacity to represent any $h \\times h$ matrix, we recover multi-head attention by setting the number of searches and retrievals as $h$ and having the \"Value Scores\" matrix as an $h \\times h$ identity matrix (or any $h \\times h$ permutation matrix in general), with $h$ being the number of heads. Thus our mechanism not only solves the redundancies highlighted in this text but also provides a more general class of attention mechanism. ## B. 2 DIFFERENCES FROM EXISTING WORK\n\nWe propose Compositional Attention, a novel attention mechanism aimed at a disentangled computation of search and retrieval. Unlike in multi-head attention, this allows for a flexible and dynamic composition of searches and retrievals. This is different from MAC and its variants (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018) because the proposed algorithm is a completely parallel system without recurrence. Further, we see that in MAC, disentanglement is driven by privileged information; i.e. through the difference between what a question and image is. This privileged information may not be present across a variety of tasks (eg. language modelling, classification, etc.). Our proposed model, however, does not require privileged information and is therefore easily applicable to a lot of different domains. Further, MAC\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-17.jpg?height=473&width=1391&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 9: Performance on OoD Contextual Retrieval Task. We showcase that our proposed mechanism outperforms standard Multi-Head attention (lower is better) on out of distribution (OoD) variant of the various setups across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. does not have multiple parallel searches and retrievals and thus, our proposed model aims to solve a considerably different problem. While one may be tempted to think of head pruning (Michel et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019) as a way of removing redundancies in standard multi-head attention, we stress that the core goal and motivation of our work is considerably different. Pruning of a head essentially means we eliminate a rigid search-retrieval pairing from the learned system as its utility for solving the task is negligible. However, in this work, the redundancy we want to solve is when a sub-part of a head is redundant but not the whole head. That is, when either the search or retrieval part of the head is redundant, but not both. Figure 1 highlights when only a sub-part of the head is redundant and not the whole head, and how compositional attention resolves the problem. Further, Compositional Attention is different from the various transformer variants Appendix A. 2 because it does not aim to solve the quadratic computational bottleneck but instead adds an inductive bias that has not been explored yet. We also note that the proposed model is amenable to the various computation tricks discovered for multi-head attention. ## B. 3 ARCHitECTURE DETAILS\n\nThe standard transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) has a number of layers, where each layer is composed of two components, the multi-head attention (Section 2.1) which is followed by a MLP (Multi-layer perceptron) with a single hidden layer. There are residual connections at the end of the multi-head attention step as well as the MLP. In this work, we follow Dehghani et al. (2018) and consider the models that have weight sharing across layers. For ease of experiments, we do not consider adaptive stopping criteria. We consider this choice because we want reusable pieces of computations, and Universal Transformers is one step towards that goal. Our view of transformer models is that different heads perform parallel information retrieval with not only different kinds of searches but also different kinds of retrievals. Information from these parallel retrievals is then jointly processed through a linear layer, followed by another MLP. There are residual connections after the linear layer and the MLP. For our proposed Compositional variants, we basically replace Multi-Head Attention in the models with Compositional Attention while keeping all the other details the same. ## B. 4 MultiPle LayERS AND WEIGHT SHARING\n\nA number of works demonstrate that Transformers with weight sharing are competitive with the standard transformer models (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019). We also believe that reusing computations provides more pressure on the system to learn meaningful and multi-purpose parameters (eg. it is easier to learn a redundant head if it is used only once vs if it is repeatedly used). One might be tempted to think that increasing the number of layers or removing weight sharing might compensate for the flexibility provided by our proposed system. However, we argue otherwise. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-18.jpg?height=414&width=1381&top_left_y=281&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 10: Convergence on Contextual Retrieval Task. We see that the proposed mechanism converges faster and works well even in low data regime (low iterations). Lets assume we have a Transformer model without parameter sharing which has $l$ layers and $h$ heads. Then, the number of unique search-retrieval pairings that can be computed by the model is $l h$ ( $h$ if parameter sharing). Contrasting this with compositional attention, we see that the number of unique search-retrieval pairings are actually $l s r$ ( $s r$ if parameter sharing) where $s$ is the number of searches and $r$ the number of retrievals. So, if we use a similar number of layers, compositional attention still allows for more combinatorial possibilities to be learnt. Viewed another way, at scale, the proposed mechanism has the potential to reduce the number of layers needed for tasks calling for flexible search and retrievals. Another important point is that even if we have more layers (with or without parameter sharing), multi-head attention can still only learn a rigid combination between search and retrieval. So, if the task requires dynamic choice from all possible pairings between search and retrieval, the model will have to learn each pairing in separate head combinations, whether it be in the same or future layers. This is because adding more layers does not change the way searches and retrievals are combined, which is what we focus on here. ## B. 5 COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY\n\nNumber of Parameters. We keep the parameter counts within 5\\% of each other for the compared models and the same parameter count at 140M parameters for the language modelling experiment. We also stress that our proposed models with fewer retrievals are even more tightly matched and often lower in parameters than the baseline and still outperform them on a number of tasks. Training Time. While Compositional Attention increases the complexity of the model, we note that the training time of proposed models are generally within $\\sim 10 \\%$ of the baseline and hence the added complexity does not impede the model much. FLOPs. We estimate the FLOPs of the proposed model for Equilateral Triangle Detection task using an off the shelf library ${ }^{2}$ and see that they are $\\sim 10 \\%$ of each other and the baseline. In particular, we also see that for fewer retrievals, the FLOPs are either the same or lower than the baseline. Parallel Computations. Transformers allow for efficient implementation using GPUs due to parallel computations for each word in the sentence (or each object in the scene). Further, they allow for parallel computation of each head for each word. Correspondingly, in our proposed model, we still do parallel computations for each word in the sentence, and compute the output of different searches in parallel. The only additional complexity is another soft-attention for choice of retrieval for each search. This is also done in parallel for each search and hence we retain all the major efficiencies that Multi-Head attention enjoys on GPUs. Amenable to Different Variations. We note that a lot of the current advances in standard multi-head attention, eg. sparse attention matrix, can be incorporated in the proposed model too. We can also have sparsity on the retrieval end where we can restrict certain searches to pick from a smaller set of retrievals. We believe that these analysis are important future works but out of scope of this paper. Complexity vs Combinatorial Advantages. While we sometimes have more complexity than multihead attention, this small increase in complexity is often offset by the combinatorial advantage that\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-19.jpg?height=394&width=1399&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=363)\n\nFigure 11: Specialization plots for the Contextual Retrieval Task. We plot the attention scores for ground truth retrieval vs learned retrieval for different task setups - left: 1 search 2 retrieval, middle: 1 search 4 retrieval, and right: 2 search 4 retrieval. we gain. In particular, for $h$ search and retrievals, multi-head attention can only compute $h$ possible search-retrieval pairings while the proposed model can compute $h^{2}$ possible pairings.\n```\n\n#### 4.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Here are the key insights and most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA)\n\n- **Concept and Benefits**: DCMHA enhances the standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) by allowing dynamic composition of attention heads, increasing expressive power without significant computational overhead. This approach addresses the low-rank bottleneck and head redundancy in standard MHA, improving model performance while maintaining efficiency.\n\n### Adaptive Computation and Conditional Computation\n\n- **Concept and Application**: This involves allocating computational resources dynamically based on token importance or input complexity. Models like CoLT5 employ conditional computation in both feedforward and attention layers, devoting more resources to important tokens. This reduces unnecessary computation and enhances scalability to longer sequences without a linear increase in computation.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Models\n\n- **Concept and Benefits**: Hierarchical attention models capture dependencies at multiple scales (local and global). Techniques like H-Transformer-1D and Stack Attention use hierarchical aggregation of tokens, where higher levels capture broader context. This approach is efficient for modeling long-range dependencies and improves performance on tasks requiring understanding of hierarchical patterns.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Concept and Application**: Methods like Sparse FlashAttention and Combiner reduce memory and computational costs associated with attention computation. These mechanisms use sparsity patterns or approximate methods to achieve linear or sub-quadratic complexity, enabling the processing of longer sequences without exceeding memory constraints.\n\n### Integration Strategy\n\n- **Combined Approach**: The researcher can propose a modified MHA unit that integrates dynamic composition of attention heads, adaptive computation, and hierarchical processing. This combined approach would enable the model to:\n  - Dynamically compose attention heads to increase expressive power.\n  - Allocate computational resources based on token importance.\n  - Capture dependencies at multiple scales efficiently.\n  - Reduce memory and computational costs through sparse or hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\n- **Compatibility**: Ensure the modifications are compatible with the existing GPT-2 architecture to avoid significant changes in model parameters or training complexity.\n- **Feasibility and Implementation**: Evaluate the complexity of integrating these modifications and consider potential challenges such as training stability and computational overhead.\n- **Prototype Development**: Implement a prototype to test feasibility and performance, running initial experiments to assess improvements in efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n- **Xiao et al.

(2023)**: \"Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention\" - Discusses sparse attention mechanisms and their efficiency.\n\n### Additional Insights from Attention Mechanism Studies\n\n- **Attention Sink**: Research on attention sink phenomena, such as the work by Cancedda (2024) and Sun et al. (2024), highlights issues like massive activations in early FFNs and the impact of positional encoding on attention sink. Understanding these phenomena can help in designing more robust attention mechanisms.\n- **First Token Dominance**: Studies on first token dominance, such as those by Xiao et al. (2024) and Bondarenko et al. (2023), indicate that this issue is not necessarily due to positional encodings but rather the softmax function and causal masking. Addressing this can improve the overall attention mechanism's effectiveness.\n\nBy integrating these insights and approaches, the researcher can develop a novel LM block that enhances performance, efficiency, and scalability for long-context sequences, aligning with the goals of improving upon current state-of-the-art models.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference. To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py). We open-sourced the code of our implementation and most of the evaluation as a colab to help others reproduce the results: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/memory_efficient_attention. ### 5.1 Inference\n\nIn Table 2 we compare the memory requirements and the compute time of the memory-efficient attention implementation and the Flax implementation of attention.\n```\n\n#### 2. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Computation-Efficient Era: A Comprehensive Survey of State Space Models in Medical Image Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Ilker Hacihaliloglu, Dorit Merhof, Ulas Bagci, Ali Diba, Reza Azad, Soheila Hatami, Afshin Bozorgpour, Bobby Azad, Sanaz Karimijafarbigloo, Sina Ghorbani Kolahi, Moein Heidari*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling plays a vital role across various domains, with recurrent neural networks being historically the predominant method of performing these tasks. However, the emergence of transformers has altered this paradigm due to their superior performance. Built upon these advances, transformers have conjoined CNNs as two leading foundational models for learning visual representations. However, transformers are hindered by the $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of their attention mechanisms, while CNNs lack global receptive fields and dynamic weight allocation. State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the \\textit{\\textbf{Mamba}} model with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, have garnered immense interest lately in sequential modeling and visual representation learning, challenging the dominance of transformers by providing infinite context lengths and offering substantial efficiency maintaining linear complexity in the input sequence. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, medical imaging has heralded a new epoch with Mamba models. Intending to help researchers navigate the surge, this survey seeks to offer an encyclopedic review of Mamba models in medical imaging. Specifically, we start with a comprehensive theoretical review forming the basis of SSMs, including Mamba architecture and its alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context. Next, we offer a structured classification of Mamba models in the medical field and introduce a diverse categorization scheme based on their application, imaging modalities, and targeted organs. Finally, we summarize key challenges, discuss different future research directions of the SSMs in the medical domain, and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. In addition, we have compiled the studies discussed in this paper along with their open-source implementations on our GitHub repository.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Attention Coding for Training High-performance and Efficient Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Liang-Jian Deng, Zhaorui Wang, Yuhong Chou, Rui-Jie Zhu, Xuerui Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as an energy-efficient alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their unique spike-based event-driven nature. Coding is crucial in SNNs as it converts external input stimuli into spatio-temporal feature sequences. However, most existing deep SNNs rely on direct coding that generates powerless spike representation and lacks the temporal dynamics inherent in human vision. Hence, we introduce Gated Attention Coding (GAC), a plug-and-play module that leverages the multi-dimensional gated attention unit to efficiently encode inputs into powerful representations before feeding them into the SNN architecture. GAC functions as a preprocessing layer that does not disrupt the spike-driven nature of the SNN, making it amenable to efficient neuromorphic hardware implementation with minimal modifications. Through an observer model theoretical analysis, we demonstrate GAC's attention mechanism improves temporal dynamics and coding efficiency. Experiments on CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GAC achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with remarkable efficiency. Notably, we improve top-1 accuracy by 3.10\\% on CIFAR100 with only 6-time steps and 1.07\\% on ImageNet while reducing energy usage to 66.9\\% of the previous works.

Dynamic Slimmable Network\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic attention implementation*\n\n*Xiaojun Chang, Zhihui Li, Xiaodan Liang, Bing Wang, Guangrun Wang, Changlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Current dynamic networks and dynamic pruning methods have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity. However, dynamic sparse patterns on convolutional filters fail to achieve actual acceleration in real-world implementation, due to the extra burden of indexing, weight-copying, or zero-masking. Here, we explore a dynamic network slimming regime, named Dynamic Slimmable Network (DS-Net), which aims to achieve good hardware-efficiency via dynamically adjusting filter numbers of networks at test time with respect to different inputs, while keeping filters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden. Our DS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by the proposed double-headed dynamic gate that comprises an attention head and a slimming head to predictively adjust network width with negligible extra computation cost. To ensure generality of each candidate architecture and the fairness of gate, we propose a disentangled two-stage training scheme inspired by one-shot NAS. In the first stage, a novel training technique for weight-sharing networks named In-place Ensemble Bootstrapping is proposed to improve the supernet training efficacy. In the second stage, Sandwich Gate Sparsification is proposed to assist the gate training by identifying easy and hard samples in an online way. Extensive experiments demonstrate our DS-Net consistently outperforms its static counterparts as well as state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 5.9%). Typically, DS-Net achieves 2-4x computation reduction and 1.62x real-world acceleration over ResNet-50 and MobileNet with minimal accuracy drops on ImageNet.

This method achieves a 10\u00d7 acceleration in transformer self-attention compared to digital counterparts. It utilizes memristor crossbar arrays for matrix operations, integrating computation into memory, which is particularly efficient for attention mechanisms.\n\n### DuoAttention\nDuoAttention introduces a dynamic attention mechanism that efficiently manages long and short contexts. It uses retrieval and streaming heads to optimize memory usage and computational load. This approach reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7 for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models and speeds up decoding by up to 2.18\u00d7. DuoAttention is scalable and can handle up to 3.3 million tokens on a single GPU, making it highly efficient for large-context tasks.\n\n### FastAttention\nFastAttention is an adaptation of FlashAttention for low-resource GPUs and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). It employs a two-level tiling strategy and tiling-AllReduce strategy to save memory and improve runtime speed. This approach is particularly useful for long sequence lengths, reducing latency by up to 45% for certain models. FastAttention also integrates CPU-GPU cooperative strategies to fully utilize available computing power and memory.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Attention Computation\n\n### DuoAttention's Cache Management\nDuoAttention optimizes memory usage by dividing attention heads into retrieval and streaming types. Retrieval heads use a full Key-Value (KV) cache, while streaming heads use a reduced, constant-length cache. This dynamic allocation of cache sizes minimizes memory usage while retaining crucial context information.\n\n### SeerAttention's Sparse Attention\nSeerAttention introduces a learnable gate to adaptively select significant blocks in the attention map, deeming the rest sparse. This block-level sparsity balances accuracy and speedup, reducing the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. SeerAttention uses a customized FlashAttention implementation to extract block-level ground truth with minimal overhead.\n\n### FastAttention's Tiling Strategy\nFastAttention's two-level tiling strategy and tiling-AllReduce strategy are designed to save memory and reduce communication overhead. This approach partitions the input matrix into multiple blocks, overlapping AllReduce operations with block calculations to improve performance.\n\n## Integration Strategies with Existing Architectures\n\n### Memristor Integration\nThe memristor-based accelerator integrates with existing transformer architectures by mapping weight matrices to memristor conductance matrices. This integration involves a hybrid circuit model and a mapping algorithm to handle the discontinuous nature of memristor conductance values.\n\n### DuoAttention with Existing Libraries\nDuoAttention can be implemented using libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers. This allows for seamless integration with existing architectures and efficient GPU utilization.\n\n### FastAttention on NPUs and GPUs\nFastAttention is designed to work on both NPUs and low-resource GPUs, such as those with Volta architecture. It adapts the FlashAttention2 kernel and redesigns the shared memory layout to fit the specific hardware, ensuring efficient utilization of available resources.\n\n## Performance Benchmarks\n\n### Memristor Accelerator\nThe memristor-based accelerator demonstrates a power consumption of \\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\) and a latency of \\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\), showing significant improvements in efficiency compared to other designs.\n\n### DuoAttention Benchmarks\nDuoAttention shows a 2.18\u00d7 speed improvement for MHA models and a 1.50\u00d7 speed improvement for GQA models. It also reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7 for MHA models and 1.67\u00d7 for GQA models.\n\n### FastAttention Performance\nFastAttention reduces latency by up to 45% for long sequence lengths on Ascend NPUs and Volta-based GPUs. It also demonstrates improved performance through its two-level tiling and tiling-AllReduce strategies.\n\nThese findings and strategies provide valuable insights into how to improve the hardware efficiency, memory optimization, and integration of dynamic attention mechanisms in autoregressive language models.\n",

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Score: 0.76)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Dynamic Routing Transformer Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yuan Tian, Nan Xu, Ruike Zhang, W. Mao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and proposes the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net), which utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal sarcasm detection is an important research topic in natural language processing and multimedia computing, and benefits a wide range of applications in multiple domains. Most existing studies regard the incongruity between image and text as the indicative clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm. To capture cross-modal incongruity, previous methods rely on fixed architectures in network design, which restricts the model from dynamically adjusting to diverse image-text pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic network, we model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. 3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Ho Hin Lee, Shunxing Bao, Yuankai Huo, Bennett A. Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie zhou, Jiwen Lu, Benlin Liu, Wenliang Zhao, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Dynamic Spatial Sparsification for Efficient Vision Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Jiwen Lu, Jie zhou, Wenliang Zhao, Zuyan Liu, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a new approach for model acceleration by exploiting spatial sparsity in visual data. We observe that the final prediction in vision Transformers is only based on a subset of the most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures and different visual recognition tasks. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration.

JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Simon Du, Beidi Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Yiping Wang, Yuandong Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings. Code can be found in https://github.com/facebookresearch/luckmatters/tree/yuandong3.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using dynamic attention, hierarchical transformers, and efficient computation, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n### Dynamic Composition of Attention Heads\n\n- **Dynamic Head Composition**: The concept of dynamic head composition involves adjusting the attention heads based on the input data. While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss \"dynamic head composition,\" the idea of adaptive attention mechanisms is relevant. For instance, the use of token importance scoring and selective computation can be seen as a form of dynamic adjustment. Research on \"LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor\" could provide insights into how attention heads can be dynamically adjusted to handle long contexts, which might be applicable to your dynamic head composition.\n\n### Adaptive Computation in Transformers\n\n- **Token Importance Scoring and Selective Computation**: Adaptive computation techniques, such as token importance scoring, allow the model to focus on the most relevant tokens, reducing computational overhead. Techniques like sparse attention mechanisms and hierarchical approaches are discussed in the context of handling long sequences efficiently. For example, sparse attention mechanisms where the model only attends to a subset of the input at each layer can be seen as a form of adaptive computation.\n\n### Multi-scale or Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: The Swin Transformer is a notable example of a hierarchical transformer architecture. It introduces a hierarchical structure that allows for varying levels of granularity in feature extraction, making it effective for tasks that require both local and global context understanding. This design is particularly useful for handling high-dimensional data and can be adapted for text processing by applying similar hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n- **MATNet**: This paper introduces a multilevel attention-based transformer network (MATNet) that extracts multilevel features of global and local contexts. This hierarchical approach can be beneficial for handling complex input sequences and improving the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Techniques such as model pruning, knowledge distillation, and efficient attention mechanisms (like linear attention or multi-query attention) are crucial for reducing memory requirements and computational complexity. These methods help in scaling up transformer models without significant performance degradation.\n- **Memristor-Based Acceleration**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention can significantly reduce power consumption and latency. This approach performs matrix operations in an analog method, integrating computation into memory, which can lead to more memory-efficient attention implementations.\n\n### Specific Details\n\n#### Computational Complexity\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: These mechanisms reduce the computational complexity by only attending to a subset of the input at each layer. This approach can significantly lower the number of MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) operations required, making the model more efficient.\n- **Memristor-Based Acceleration**: The memristor-based approach reduces the computational complexity by avoiding intermediate results and data dependencies, leading to faster matrix multiplication operations.\n\n#### Memory Requirements\n- **Model Pruning and Knowledge Distillation**: These techniques reduce the size of the model without significantly impacting performance, thereby reducing memory requirements.\n- **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of model weights can decrease memory usage and computational requirements, making the model more memory-efficient.\n\n#### Implementation Approaches\n- **Hierarchical Structure**: Implementing a hierarchical structure, as seen in the Swin Transformer, allows for multi-scale feature extraction and can be adapted for various tasks, including text processing.\n- **Memristor Crossbar Array**: Using a memristor crossbar array for matrix operations integrates computation into memory, providing a novel and efficient implementation approach.\n\n#### Performance Metrics\n- **Performance on Long Sequences**: Techniques like relative positional encoding and hierarchical approaches improve the model\u2019s ability to handle longer sequences, maintaining performance on sequences of varying lengths.\n- **Efficiency Metrics**: Metrics such as power consumption (e.g., \\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\)) and latency (e.g., \\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\)) are crucial for evaluating the efficiency of the model, especially when using novel hardware accelerators like memristor-based systems.\n\nBy integrating these concepts\u2014dynamic attention mechanisms, hierarchical processing, adaptive computation, and memory-efficient implementations\u2014the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and high-performance autoregressive language model.\n",

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Y. Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/34 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n(Left) Memory Usage Comparison. (Right) Cumulative Time Comparison. only a vector. Measuring this empirically in comparable models, we found that Transformers used $3,152,384$ parameters. In contrast, the equivalent Aarens used 3, 152, 896 parameters, representing only a marginal $\\sim 0.016 \\%$ parameter increase - a minor trade-off for the significant gains in memory and time complexities. ## 5 Related Work\n\nClosest to Aaren are approximations of attention such as those by RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). These models proposed linearizations of the standard softmax-based attention that allow them to be formulated as an RNN. However, in doing so, these models also encode an exponential factor that biases tokens based on their timestamp, limiting their potential applications. In contrast, Aaren leverages an exact re-formulation of softmax attention as an RNN, allowing the model itself to compute the weight of each token. Feng et al. (2023) showed attention can be computed recurrently, using it to compress set-based inputs. Rabe and Staats (2022) introduced a recurrent formulation of attention, showing that self-attention can be computed efficiently. Katharopoulos et al. (2020) showed that Transformers with a causal mask can be viewed as an RNN. In contrast, we (1) show a more general result whereas any attention model can be viewed as an RNN. Furthermore, we (2) introduce Aaren, a new attention formulation based on parallel prefix sums, that achieves competitive results with that of Transformers while being more efficient. The problem of computing prefix scans/sums has been well studied with various efficient parallelized algorithms proposed for computing them. Since Aaren only requires the output of the prefix scan, any efficient algorithm for computing it can be used. In this work, we outlined the method by Hillis and Steele (1986). This method is time efficient for parallel computation, requiring $\\log _{2}(N)$ sequential steps and $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log (N))$ overall computation. In contrast, the method by Ladner and Fischer (1980) use mores sequential steps (specifically, $2 \\log _{2}(N)-2$ ) but only performs $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ overall computation. For a more in-depth introduction to parallel prefix sums algorithms, we refer the reader to the following work by Blelloch (1990). In this work, we applied Transformers to a subset of applications. For a broad overview of the applications of Transformers, we refer the reader to the following survey by Islam et al. (2023). For an overview of different transformer models applied to the specific settings considered in this paper, we refer the reader to the following surveys (1) on transformers in reinforcement learning by Li et al. (2023) and (2) on transformers in event forecasting, time series forecasting, time series classification, and more by Wen et al. (2022). ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we showed that attention can be formulated as an RNN whereas the conventional way of computing attention is a parallelized method of computing its many-to-one RNN output. Building on the RNN formulation, we showed that existing attention-based models can be formulated as RNNs. However, unlike traditional RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, these methods cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens. Addressing this, we introduced a new parallelized method of computing attention's many-to-many RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we introduced Aaren, a new module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be efficiently updated at inference time, thereby requiring only constant memory (like RNNs). Empirically, we showed that Aarens achieve performance competitive with Transformers on 38 datasets spread across four sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting. Finally, we empirically show that Aarens are significantly more time and memory-efficient than Transformers. ## References\n\nAgarwal, P., Rahman, A. A., St-Charles, P.-L., Prince, S.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*A. Ardakani, C. Condo, W. Gross*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparsely-connected neural networks are proposed, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets while proposing an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely- connected networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory-efficient implementations of attention mechanisms, hardware optimization techniques, and performance metrics, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Sparse Attention\nThe paper on \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" introduces a novel sparse attention architecture that optimizes memory and computational efficiency. It proposes sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context. This approach achieves significant speed-ups (up to 25.3X for 70B models) and maintains strong downstream performance.\n\n### DuoAttention\nDuoAttention is another mechanism that optimizes memory usage by categorizing attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming types. Retrieval heads maintain a full KV cache for long-term context, while Streaming heads use a reduced, constant-length cache for recent tokens. This approach reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7 for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) models and improves decoding speed by up to 2.18\u00d7.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for Transformer Models\n\n### S2-Attention Kernel\nThe S2-Attention kernel, part of the sparse attention architecture, is designed with hardware efficiency in mind. It optimizes memory access patterns and parallelization, leading to substantial speed-ups over traditional dense attention implementations. This kernel is applicable in both training and inference, significantly lowering the barrier to exploring novel sparse attention architectures.\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerator\nThe memristor-based accelerator for transformer self-attention leverages in-memory computing to achieve a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts. This design uses a hybrid circuit model and maps weight matrices to memristor conductance values, optimizing matrix multiplication and softmax calculations. The memristor design reduces power consumption and latency, making it a promising hardware optimization technique.\n\n### FastAttention\nFastAttention is an adaptation of FlashAttention for low-resource GPUs and NPUs. It employs a two-level tiling strategy, tiling-mask strategy, and tiling-AllReduce strategy to save memory and improve runtime speedup. This approach is particularly beneficial for NPUs and low-resource GPUs, achieving significant performance improvements (up to 10.7\u00d7 speedup for PanGu-38B models).\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks\n\n### Speed-Up and Memory Efficiency\n- The sparse attention architecture with the S2-Attention kernel achieves wall-clock speed-ups of 8.79X, 15.87X, and 25.3X compared to FlashAttention-2, with strong downstream performance and perfect retrieval performance at a 128k context length.\n- DuoAttention demonstrates a 2.18\u00d7 speed improvement for MHA models and reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7. It can handle up to 3.3 million tokens on a single A100 GPU, showcasing its scalability.\n- FastAttention achieves significant speed-ups (up to 10.7\u00d7) on low-resource GPUs and NPUs, optimizing memory usage and communication overhead.\n\n### Implementation Trade-Offs\n- The sparse attention approach must balance efficiency and performance, often requiring a hybrid design that combines sparse and dense attention to ensure direct access to all tokens at certain layers.\n- Memristor-based accelerators require careful mapping of weight matrices to memristor conductance values and handling of negative conductances, which adds complexity but offers substantial efficiency gains.\n- FastAttention involves trade-offs between memory saving and computational overhead, particularly in managing attention masks and AllReduce operations.\n\nThese findings highlight several strategies for improving autoregressive language models through memory-efficient attention implementations and hardware optimization techniques, each with specific performance metrics and implementation trade-offs.\n",

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

On the one hand, Dong et al. [6] and Noci et al. [19] initiated the discussion of attention localization and theoretically showed that a network with self-attention layers without skip connections exponentially loses the rank of hidden layers; the fact indicates that the model expressivity shall be immediately lost with more self-attention layers stacked. On the other hand, Zhai et al. [31] empirically found that attention entropy-averaged Shannon entropy of an attention probability matrix-correlates with training stability. Specifically, a training loss curve tends to fall into a plateau when attention entropy is low. Since higher entropy indicates near-uniform attention weights, their finding apparently suggests that localized attention may lead the learning dynamics to a plateau. Up until now, these two failure modes have been discussed independently with slightly different notions of attention localization, and hence, our understanding of the blessing and curse of attention localization remains elusive. To better comprehend, we characterize self-attention patterns by attention parameter matrices to reconcile the two collapse modes. We formulate the concept of localization by signal propagation probability (Section 3), which describes how likely the signal of a specific input token propagates to the gradient of a training objective. If the signal propagation probability is high for a few numbers of tokens only, attention is regarded to be localized. We show that the localization mode can be characterized by the eigenspectrum of attention weight matrices (Section 4). Specifically, attention is localized in the above sense when the eigenspectrum of the query-key parameter matrix has a non-zero mean and a small variance. Furthermore, the small eigenspectrum variance is relevant to both the rank collapse and entropy collapse (Section 5), and thus, we give a unified perspective of the two notions of attention collapse. For this reason, we argue that attention collapse and its performance can be viewed more transparently based on the eigenspectrum variance. Lastly, we verified the correlation of the eigenspectrum and the model performance in the experiments with the WikiText dataset [16] by introducing a regularization scheme called LocAteR.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIt has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers have been widely adopted in language modeling [28], vision tasks [7, 27], and speech recognition [13]. A crucial building block in transformers is the attention mechanism, dating back to Graves [8], which was initially designed to capture long-range signals in sequential inputs by mixing individual tokens but has also been leveraged to capture general structures of input data. After the fully-attentionbased language model has appeared [5], the research community gets interested in the functionality and benefits of the attention. To mention a few, transformers implicitly prefer hierarchical interpretations of input sequences [10]; store relational knowledge in MLP layers as an associative memory [15]; its computational graphs tend to be tree-structured [18]; suddenly capture tree structures of inputs after long training epochs [17]. Theoretically, training dynamics analysis explains how to learn spatially correlated patches by vision transformers (ViT) [9], select dominant tokens [25], store information as an associative memory [3], and select max-margin tokens [24], whereas Xie et al. [29] explains the in-context learning as a process of concept learning in Bayesian inference. Among many aspects of attention, we specifically focus on localization-for a query token, selfattention can select a few relevant tokens only (which we call localized attention) or select many tokens\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_82543d419cbc987219f8g-02.jpg?height=569&width=780&top_left_y=275&top_left_x=638)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of softmax $\\mathbf{S}$ and the piecewise approximation $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{S}}$ for two-dimensional inputs. uniformly. As attention can be regarded as a token mixer, it plays a pivotal role in studying how it selects tokens to reveal the characteristics of the token embeddings. To this end, we have the following research questions: (Q1) When is self-attention localized or uniform?(Q2) How does localization affect model performances?\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

A Contextual Hierarchical Attention Network with Adaptive Objective for Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Yong Shan, Zekang Li, Jinchao Zhang, Fandong Meng, Yang Feng, Cheng Niu, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations, and proposes an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs. However, most of them have limitations to efficiently exploit relevant context due to the lack of a powerful mechanism for modeling interactions between the slot and the dialogue history. Besides, existing methods usually ignore the slot imbalance problem and treat all slots indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard slots and eventually hurts overall performance. In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations. We further propose an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training. Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. Train Faster, Perform Better: Modular Adaptive Training in Over-Parameterized Models\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Yubin Shi, Yixuan Chen, Mingzhi Dong, Xiaochen Yang, Dongsheng Li, Yujiang Wang, Robert P. Dick, Qin Lv, Yingying Zhao, Fan Yang, Tun Lu, Ning Gu, L. Shang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy and proposes a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT), which can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their prevalence in deep-learning communities, over-parameterized models convey high demands of computational costs for proper training. This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy. Empirical evidence reveals that when scaling down into network modules, such as heads in self-attention models, we can observe varying learning patterns implicitly associated with each module's trainability. To describe such modular-level learning capabilities, we introduce a novel concept dubbed modular neural tangent kernel (mNTK), and we demonstrate that the quality of a module's learning is tightly associated with its mNTK's principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A large $\\lambda_{\\max}$ indicates that the module learns features with better convergence, while those miniature ones may impact generalization negatively. Inspired by the discovery, we propose a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT) to update those modules with their $\\lambda_{\\max}$ exceeding a dynamic threshold selectively, concentrating the model on learning common features and ignoring those inconsistent ones. Unlike most existing training schemes with a complete BP cycle across all network modules, MAT can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance. Experiments show that MAT nearly halves the computational cost of model training and outperforms the accuracy of baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Zaixin Zhang, Qi Liu, Qingyong Hu, Cheekong Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the main deficiencies of current graph transformers and formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in a number of domains including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers:(1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning Efficient GANs for Image Translation via Differentiable Masks and co-Attention Distillation\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Ling Shao, Rongrong Ji, Fei Chao, Yan Wang, Mingbao Lin, Shaojie Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely-used in image translation, but their high computation and storage costs impede the deployment on mobile devices. Prevalent methods for CNN compression cannot be directly applied to GANs due to the peculiarties of GAN tasks and the unstable adversarial training. To solve these, in this paper, we introduce a novel GAN compression method, termed DMAD, by proposing a Differentiable Mask and a co-Attention Distillation. The former searches for a light-weight generator architecture in a training-adaptive manner. To overcome channel inconsistency when pruning the residual connections, an adaptive cross-block group sparsity is further incorporated. The latter simultaneously distills informative attention maps from both the generator and discriminator of a pre-trained model to the searched generator, effectively stabilizing the adversarial training of our light-weight model. Experiments show that DMAD can reduce the Multiply Accumulate Operations (MACs) of CycleGAN by 13x and that of Pix2Pix by 4x while retaining a comparable performance against the full model.

Skyformer: Remodel Self-Attention with Gaussian Kernel and Nystr\\\"om Method\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*Yun Yang, Heng Ji, Qi Zeng, Yifan Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are expensive to train due to the quadratic time and space complexity in the self-attention mechanism. On the other hand, although kernel machines suffer from the same computation bottleneck in pairwise dot products, several approximation schemes have been successfully incorporated to considerably reduce their computational cost without sacrificing too much accuracy. In this work, we leverage the computation methods for kernel machines to alleviate the high computational cost and introduce Skyformer, which replaces the softmax structure with a Gaussian kernel to stabilize the model training and adapts the Nystr\u00f6m method to a non-positive semidefinite matrix to accelerate the computation. We further conduct theoretical analysis by showing that the matrix approximation error of our proposed method is small in the spectral norm. Experiments on Long Range Arena benchmark show that the proposed method is sufficient in getting comparable or even better performance than the full self-attention while requiring fewer computation resources.\n\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Extending LLMs' Context Window with 100 Samples\n\n*From Search Query: training stability adaptive attention performance*\n\n*PengFei Liu, Junlong Li, Yikai Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to have limited extrapolation ability beyond their pre-trained context window, constraining their application in downstream tasks with lengthy inputs. Recent studies have sought to extend LLMs' context window by modifying rotary position embedding (RoPE), a popular position encoding method adopted by well-known LLMs such as LLaMA, PaLM, and GPT-NeoX. However, prior works like Position Interpolation (PI) and YaRN are resource-intensive and lack comparative experiments to assess their applicability. In this work, we identify the inherent need for LLMs' attention entropy (i.e. the information entropy of attention scores) to maintain stability and introduce a novel extension to RoPE which combines adjusting RoPE's base frequency and scaling the attention logits to help LLMs efficiently adapt to a larger context window. We validate the superiority of our method in both fine-tuning performance and robustness across different context window sizes on various context-demanding tasks. Notably, our method extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B-Chat to 16,384 with only 100 samples and 6 training steps, showcasing extraordinary efficiency. Finally, we also explore how data compositions and training curricula affect context window extension for specific downstream tasks, suggesting fine-tuning LLMs with lengthy conversations as a good starting point.

DAAM dynamically adjusts the attention distribution using Gaussian parameters, which helps in maintaining a balanced distribution of attention. This mechanism is crucial for handling both non-stationary and stationary data, enhancing the model's adaptability and stability.\n\n### Layer Normalization and Reparameterization\nMethods to improve training stability in Transformer models, such as layer normalization after Q and K layers, and reparameterization of linear layer weights, are discussed in. These techniques help in controlling the magnitude of linear layer outputs and preventing entropy collapse, which is essential for stable training.\n\n### Gradient and Learning Rate Management\nAdaptive learning rate methods like AdaGrad, RMSprop, and Adam, as well as techniques such as gradient clipping and restarting training from checkpoints, can significantly enhance training stability.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Evaluation Methods for Dynamic Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Entropy and Attention Distribution\nThe DAAM mechanism evaluates performance based on the entropy of the attention distribution, ensuring that the model does not overly focus on a few features but instead considers a broader array of information. Higher entropy signifies a more balanced distribution, which is vital for complex tasks.\n\n### Training Convergence and Loss Metrics\nEvaluating training stability through metrics such as the L2 norm of linear layer outputs, loss spikes, and the use of additional losses (e.g., z_loss) to encourage softmax normalizers to be close to 0, can provide insights into the model's performance and stability.\n\n## Implementation Details of Hierarchical Attention Architectures\n\n### Multi-Head and Mixture of Densities\nThe extended DAAM incorporates multiple attention heads, each with its Gaussian mixture model, to process different segments of the input tensor in parallel. This approach enhances model robustness and efficiency by reducing the number of learnable parameters.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nImplementations like CHELA and Lightning Attention-2, mentioned in the analysis, demonstrate hierarchical attention processing. CHELA uses a divide-and-conquer approach with global abstraction and data-dependent selection, while Lightning Attention-2 enables linear attention to handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Strategies and Performance Benchmarks\n\n### Integration with Hardware Optimization\nTo integrate hierarchical attention mechanisms efficiently, it is crucial to consider hardware-specific optimizations. Techniques such as IO-aware implementations, tiling strategies, and careful attention to GPU memory hierarchy can significantly improve performance and efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\nPerformance can be benchmarked using metrics such as perplexity in corpora, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs. Additionally, evaluating the model's scalability by measuring its performance with increasing data and model sizes is essential[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design:\n\n- Implement dynamic attention mechanisms like DAAM to enhance adaptability and stability.\n- Use layer normalization, reparameterization, and adaptive learning rate methods to improve training stability.\n- Evaluate performance using entropy, training convergence metrics, and loss functions.\n- Employ hierarchical attention architectures with multi-head and mixture of densities approaches.\n- Integrate these mechanisms with hardware-specific optimizations to ensure efficient and scalable performance.\n",

As the sequence length increases, the memory and computational requirements become prohibitive, limiting the scalability and applicability of LMs to tasks involving long documents or contexts. Additionally, standard MHA suffers from head redundancy and lacks the ability to adaptively allocate computational resources based on token importance, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference.\n\n## Related Work\n\nSeveral approaches have been proposed to address the limitations of MHA:\n\n- **Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA)** introduces dynamic composition of attention heads to increase expressive power without significant computational overhead.\n- **Conditional Computation models (e.g., CoLT5)** allocate computational resources dynamically based on token importance, devoting more resources to informative tokens.\n- **Hierarchical Attention Models** employ hierarchical structures to capture dependencies at multiple scales efficiently.\n- **Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms** like Sparse FlashAttention reduce computational costs through sparse attention patterns.\n\nThese methods have influenced our design by highlighting the benefits of dynamic composition, adaptive computation, and hierarchical processing in addressing the challenges of long-context handling in LMs.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Concepts and Philosophy\n\nThe primary challenges we aim to address are:\n\n1. **Scalability to Long Sequences**: Reducing the computational complexity of attention mechanisms to handle longer sequences efficiently.\n\n2. **Adaptive Resource Allocation**: Allocating computational resources dynamically based on token importance to focus on informative parts of the sequence.\n\n3. **Enhanced Model Expressiveness**: Increasing the expressive power of the model by allowing attention heads to dynamically compose and share information.\n\n### Mathematical and Logical Arguments\n\n1. **Dynamic Head Composition**:\n\n   - *Problem*: Standard MHA uses fixed, independent heads, leading to redundancy and limited expressiveness.\n\n   - *Solution*: Allow attention heads to dynamically compose through learned gating mechanisms, enabling heads to collaborate and share information.\n\n   - *Benefit*: Increases the rank of the attention mechanism, enhancing model capacity without significant parameter increase.\n\n2. **Adaptive Computation**:\n\n   - *Problem*: Uniform computational effort across tokens leads to inefficiency, especially when processing lengthy sequences with varying token importance.\n\n   - *Solution*: Introduce a token importance scoring mechanism to allocate more computational resources to important tokens.\n\n   - *Benefit*: Reduces unnecessary computation, improves efficiency, and maintains model performance.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Attention Processing**:\n\n   - *Problem*: Capturing long-range dependencies requires processing global context, increasing computational cost.\n\n   - *Solution*: Implement a hierarchical attention structure where higher levels operate on compressed representations of the input.\n\n   - *Benefit*: Efficiently models dependencies at multiple scales, reducing computational complexity.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Mitigations\n\n- **Computational Overhead**: Introducing dynamic composition and adaptive mechanisms may add computational overhead.\n\n  - *Mitigation*: Design lightweight gating mechanisms and efficient algorithms to minimize additional computations.\n\n- **Training Complexity**: More complex attention mechanisms may complicate training dynamics.\n\n  - *Mitigation*: Use careful initialization, regularization, and potentially curriculum learning to stabilize training.\n\n- **Compatibility with Existing Architectures**: Modifications must align with the GPT-2 architecture.\n\n  - *Mitigation*: Ensure that changes are as modular as possible, allowing for integration without extensive architectural overhaul.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection MHA```\n\n### Modifications and New Structures\n\nWe propose an enhanced Multi-Head Attention mechanism, **AdaptiveHierarchicalMHA**, which integrates:\n\n1. **Dynamic Head Composition**:\n\n   - Each attention head can dynamically compose with others based on the input, using learned gating mechanisms.\n\n2. **Adaptive Computation**:\n\n   - Introduce a token importance scorer to determine the significance of each token.\n\n   - Allocate computational resources adaptively, focusing more on important tokens.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Attention Processing**:\n\n   - Implement attention at multiple hierarchical levels (local and global).\n\n   - Higher-level attention operates on compressed summaries of the input.\n\n### Detailed Description\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Head Composition\n\n- **Mechanism**:\n\n  - Let there be **H** attention heads.\n\n  - Instead of computing each head independently, introduce a gating matrix **G** of size *(H, H)* learned parameters.\n\n  - For each head, its output is a weighted combination of other heads' computations:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Output}_h = \\sum_{k=1}^H G_{h,k} \\cdot \\text{Head}_k(Q, K, V)\n    \\]\n\n- **Mathematical Formulation**:\n\n  - **G** is a dynamically computed matrix based on the input:\n\n    \\[\n    G = \\text{softmax}(\\mathbf{W}_g \\cdot \\mathbf{X}^T)\n    \\]\n\n    where \\(\\mathbf{W}_g\\) are learnable parameters, and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the input embedding.\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Computation\n\n- **Token Importance Scorer**:\n\n  - Compute an importance score \\( s_i \\) for each token \\( i \\):\n\n    \\[\n    s_i = \\sigma(\\mathbf{w}_s^T \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_i + b_s)\n    \\]\n\n    where \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid function, \\(\\mathbf{w}_s\\) and \\(b_s\\) are learnable parameters, and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is the embedding of token \\( i \\).\n\n- **Adaptive Computation Mask**:\n\n  - Define a threshold \\( \\tau \\) (hyperparameter).\n\n  - Create a mask \\( m_i \\) for each token:\n\n    \\[\n    m_i = \n    \\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if } s_i > \\tau \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}\n    \\]\n\n- **Computational Allocation**:\n\n  - Perform full attention computation only on tokens with \\( m_i = 1 \\).\n\n  - For tokens with \\( m_i = 0 \\), apply a simplified computation or skip.\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Attention Processing\n\n- **Local Attention Level**:\n\n  - Compute attention within a local window of size \\( w \\).\n\n- **Global Attention Level**:\n\n  - Compress input into summaries (e.g., via mean pooling or convolution).\n\n  - Compute attention over these summaries to capture global context.\n\n- **Combined Output**:\n\n  - Combine local and global attention outputs:\n\n    \\[\n    \\text{Output} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{LocalAttention} + (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot \\text{GlobalAttention}\n    \\]\n\n    where \\( \\alpha \\) is a learnable parameter.\n\n### Theoretical Justifications\n\n- **Expressiveness**:\n\n  - Dynamic head composition increases the rank and diversity of the attention mechanism.\n\n- **Efficiency**:\n\n  - Adaptive computation reduces unnecessary calculations on less important tokens, lowering overall computational cost.\n\n- **Scalability**:\n\n  - Hierarchical processing reduces the sequence length at higher levels, decreasing computational complexity from \\( O(n^2) \\) to \\( O(n \\log n) \\) or \\( O(n) \\).\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified MHA (AdaptiveHierarchicalMHA)\n\n```python\nclass AdaptiveHierarchicalMHA(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, \n                 num_heads=8, window_size=32, tau=0.5, device=None, dtype=None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.head_dim = embed_dim // num_heads\n        self.window_size = window_size\n        self.tau = tau\n        self.softmax_scale = self.head_dim ** -0.5\n        self.query_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.key_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.value_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.token_importance = nn.Linear(embed_dim, 1, bias=True, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.gating_matrix = nn.Linear(embed_dim, num_heads * num_heads, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        self.global_compressor = nn.AvgPool1d(kernel_size=self.window_size)\n        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(0.5, device=device, dtype=dtype))\n        \n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        B, L, D = X.shape\n\n        # Compute token importance scores\n        scores = torch.sigmoid(self.token_importance(X)).squeeze(-1)  # Shape: (B, L)\n        masks = (scores > self.tau).float()  # Shape: (B, L)\n\n        # Adaptive Computation\n        X_adapted = X * masks.unsqueeze(-1)  # Masked input embeddings\n\n        # Compute Q, K, V\n        Q = self.query_proj(X_adapted)\n        K = self.key_proj(X_adapted)\n        V = self.value_proj(X_adapted)\n\n        # Reshape for multi-head attention\n        Q = Q.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  # Shape: (B, H, L, D_head)\n        K = K.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n        V = V.view(B, L, self.num_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)\n\n        # Dynamic Head Composition\n        G = self.gating_matrix(X).view(B, self.num_heads, self.num_heads)  # Shape: (B, H, H)\n        G = torch.softmax(G, dim=-1)  # Normalize gating matrix\n\n        # Local Attention\n        local_outputs = self.compute_local_attention(Q, K, V, masks)\n\n        # Global Attention\n        global_outputs = self.compute_global_attention(Q, K, V, masks)\n\n        # Combine Local and Global Attention\n        output = self.alpha * local_outputs + (1 -
