One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 2. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. PanGu-\u03c0: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation (Avg.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/62 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[15] A. Katharopoulos et al.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/53 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1909.08053, 2019.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Polyhedron Attention Module: Learning Adaptive-order Interactions\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention*\n\n*Tan Zhu, Fei Dou, Xinyu Wang, Jin Lu, Jinbo Bi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) is proposed to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning feature interactions can be the key for multivariate predictive modeling. ReLU-activated neural networks create piecewise linear prediction models. Other nonlinear activation functions lead to models with only high-order feature interactions, thus lacking of interpretability. Recent methods incorporate candidate polynomial terms of fixed orders into deep learning, which is subject to the issue of combinatorial explosion, or learn the orders that are difficult to adapt to different regions of the feature space. We propose a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece.

Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Hakkani-T\u00fcr, Di Jin, Heng Ji, Yun Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Skeinformer to accelerate self-attention and further improve the accuracy of matrix approximation to self-Attention with column sampling, adaptive row normalization and pilot sampling reutilization.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models are not efficient in processing long sequences due to the quadratic space and time complexity of the self-attention modules. To address this limitation, Linformer and Informer reduce the quadratic complexity to linear (modulo logarithmic factors) via low-dimensional projection and row selection, respectively. These two models are intrinsically connected, and to understand their connection we introduce a theoretical framework of matrix sketching. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose Skeinformer to accelerate self-attention and further improve the accuracy of matrix approximation to self-attention with column sampling, adaptive row normalization and pilot sampling reutilization.

Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention scaling*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Lifelong Sequence Generation with Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention scaling*\n\n*Chengwei Qin, Shafiq R. Joty, Chen Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA) is proposed, which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Lifelong sequence generation (LSG), a problem in continual learning, aims to continually train a model on a sequence of generation tasks to learn constantly emerging new generation patterns while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Multiple Futures Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention scaling*\n\n*Yichuan Tang, R.

Motion prediction needs to model the inherently uncertain future which often contains multiple potential outcomes, due to multi-agent interactions and the latent goals of others. Towards these goals, we introduce a probabilistic framework that efficiently learns latent variables to jointly model the multi-step future motions of agents in a scene. Our framework is data-driven and learns semantically meaningful latent variables to represent the multimodal future, without requiring explicit labels. Using a dynamic attention-based state encoder, we learn to encode the past as well as the future interactions among agents, efficiently scaling to any number of agents. Finally, our model can be used for planning via computing a conditional probability density over the trajectories of other agents given a hypothetical rollout of the ego agent. We demonstrate our algorithms by predicting vehicle trajectories of both simulated and real data, demonstrating the state-of-the-art results on several vehicle trajectory datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 325  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 7. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient transformer attention*\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 2027  (*Influential: 227*)\n\n#### 8. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient transformer attention*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

CvT: Introducing Convolutions to Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention scaling*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Mengchen Liu, Noel Codella, Bin Xiao, Haiping Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present in this paper a new architecture, named Convolutional vision Transformer (CvT), that improves Vision Transformer (ViT) in performance and efficiency by introducing convolutions into ViT to yield the best of both designs. This is accomplished through two primary modifications: a hierarchy of Transformers containing a new convolutional token embedding, and a convolutional Transformer block leveraging a convolutional projection. These changes introduce desirable properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the ViT architecture (\\ie shift, scale, and distortion invariance) while maintaining the merits of Transformers (\\ie dynamic attention, global context, and better generalization). We validate CvT by conducting extensive experiments, showing that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets on ImageNet-1k, with fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. In addition, performance gains are maintained when pretrained on larger datasets (\\eg ImageNet-22k) and fine-tuned to downstream tasks. Pre-trained on ImageNet-22k, our CvT-W24 obtains a top-1 accuracy of 87.7\\% on the ImageNet-1k val set. Finally, our results show that the positional encoding, a crucial component in existing Vision Transformers, can be safely removed in our model, simplifying the design for higher resolution vision tasks.

Selective Kernel Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention scaling*\n\n*Xiang Li, Jian Yang, Xiaolin Hu, Wenhai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive fields of\nartificial neurons in each layer are designed to share the same size. It is\nwell-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of\nvisual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely\nconsidered in constructing CNNs. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in\nCNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size\nbased on multiple scales of input information. A building block called\nSelective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with\ndifferent kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the\ninformation in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield\ndifferent sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion\nlayer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel\nNetworks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show\nthat SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower\nmodel complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture\ntarget objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons\nfor adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.\nThe code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/SKNet.\n\n**Conference:** selective-kernel-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-15\n\n\n\n#### 5.

However, these visual transformers are pre-trained with hundreds of millions of images using an expensive infrastructure, thereby limiting their adoption. In this work, we produce a competitive convolution-free transformer by training on Imagenet only. We train them on a single computer in less than 3 days. Our reference vision transformer (86M parameters) achieves top-1 accuracy of 83.1% (single-crop evaluation) on ImageNet with no external data. More importantly, we introduce a teacher-student strategy specific to transformers. It relies on a distillation token ensuring that the student learns from the teacher through attention. We show the interest of this token-based distillation, especially when using a convnet as a teacher. This leads us to report results competitive with convnets for both Imagenet (where we obtain up to 85.2% accuracy) and when transferring to other tasks. We share our code and models.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient transformer attention*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

This can be achieved through methods like adaptive attention spans, where different heads in multi-head attention can attend over varying ranges, optimizing resource allocation[5|.\n  - For example, the work on \"Adaptive Attention Span in Transformers\" by Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) discusses how different heads can adapt their attention spans based on the importance of information, which can be a valuable approach for optimizing efficiency.\n\n### Linear Attention\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention**: The introduction of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) is a promising approach for achieving linear time and space complexity. GLA replaces the softmax in self-attention with a general kernel function and introduces a data-dependent gating mechanism, which enhances performance without the quadratic complexity of traditional self-attention[2|.\n  - The paper on \"Lina-Speech\" highlights how GLA can achieve competitive performance with significantly fewer parameters and linear complexity, making it an efficient alternative.\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Linear attention mechanisms, such as those proposed by Katharopoulos et al. (2020), approximate the softmax attention using kernel feature maps. This approach reduces the computational complexity from \\(O(N^2)\\) to \\(O(N)\\), where \\(N\\) is the sequence length[3|.\n  - The \"Linformer\" model by Wang et al. (2020) also projects the sequence length dimension to a lower dimension, achieving linear complexity without significant performance loss.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Sparse and Low-Rank Approaches**: Techniques like sparse attention and low-rank approximations can further optimize attention mechanisms. For instance, the \"CASAK-V\" model introduces dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which maintains performance while reducing memory usage and inference time[4|.\n  - This approach dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns, ensuring efficient processing of long sequences.\n\n### Memory Management and Compression\n\n- **Constant-Sized Memory**: The use of a constant-sized memory represented by a matrix-valued state in GLA models can efficiently manage state information without expanding the memory footprint over time. This is particularly useful for long sequences and can be tuned using techniques like initial-state tuning[2|.\n  - The \"CASAK-V\" model also employs adaptive KV-cache compression, which helps in managing memory efficiently without compromising on performance.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **\"Lina-Speech: Gated Linear Attention is a Fast and Parameter-Efficient Model\"**:\n   - This paper introduces Gated Linear Attention, which achieves linear complexity and competitive performance with fewer parameters.\n\n2. **\"Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Programmers\"**:\n   - This work by Katharopoulos et al.

In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to $4000 x$ faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models were originally introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) in the context of neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) and have demonstrated impressive results on a variety of tasks dealing with natural language (Devlin et al., 2019), audio (Sperber et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2019). Apart from tasks with ample supervision, transformers are also effective in transferring knowledge to tasks with limited or no supervision when they are pretrained with autoregressive (Radford et al., 2018; 2019) or masked language modeling objectives (Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Song et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2020). However, these benefits often come with a very high computational and memory cost. The bottleneck is mainly caused\n\n[^0]by the global receptive field of self-attention, which processes contexts of $N$ inputs with a quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. As a result, in practice transformers are slow to train and their context is limited. This disrupts temporal coherence and hinders the capturing of long-term dependencies. Dai et al. (2019) addressed the latter by attending to memories from previous contexts albeit at the expense of computational efficiency. Lately, researchers shifted their attention to approaches that increase the context length without sacrificing efficiency. Towards this end, Child et al. (2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix to reduce the selfattention complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Kitaev et al. (2020) further reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ using localitysensitive hashing. This made scaling to long sequences possible. Even though the aforementioned models can be efficiently trained on large sequences, they do not speed-up autoregressive inference. In this paper, we introduce the linear transformer model that significantly reduces the memory footprint and scales linearly with respect to the context length. We achieve this by using a kernel-based formulation of self-attention and the associative property of matrix products to calculate the self-attention weights (\u00a7 3.2). Using our linear formulation, we also express causal masking with linear complexity and constant memory (\u00a73.3). This reveals the relation between transformers and RNNs, which enables us to perform autoregressive inference orders of magnitude faster (\u00a7 3.4). Our evaluation on image generation and automatic speech recognition demonstrates that linear transformer can reach the performance levels of transformer, while being up to three orders of magnitude faster during inference. ## 2. Related Work\n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the most relevant works that seek to address the large memory and computational requirements of transformers. Furthermore, we discuss methods that theoretically analyze the core component of the transformer model, namely self-attention. Finally, we present another line of work that seeks to alleviate the softmax bottleneck in the attention computation. ### 2.1. Efficient Transformers\n\nExisting works seek to improve memory efficiency in transformers through weight pruning (Michel et al., 2019), weight factorization (Lan et al., 2020), weight quantization (Zafrir et al., 2019) or knowledge distillation. Clark et al. (2020) proposed a new pretraining objective called replaced token detection that is more sample efficient and reduces the overall computation. Lample et al. (2019) used product-key attention to increase the capacity of any layer with negligible computational overhead. Reducing the memory or computational requirements with these methods leads to training or inference time speedups, but, fundamentally, the time complexity is still quadratic with respect to the sequence length which hinders scaling to long sequences. In contrast, we show that our method reduces both memory and time complexity of transformers both theoretically ( $\\S 3.2$ ) and empirically (\u00a7 4.1). Another line of research aims at increasing the \"context\" of self-attention in transformers. Context refers to the maximum part of the sequence that is used for computing selfattention. Dai et al. (2019) introduced Transformer-XL which achieves state-of-the-art in language modeling by learning dependencies beyond a fixed length context without disrupting the temporal coherence. However, maintaining previous contexts in memory introduces significant additional computational cost. In contrast, Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) extended the context length significantly by learning the optimal attention span per attention head, while maintaining control over the memory footprint and computation time. Note that both approaches have the same asymptotic complexity as the vanilla model. In contrast, we improve the asymptotic complexity of the self-attention, which allows us to use significantly larger context. More related to our model are the works of Child et al.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

This work studies the fine-grained, modular-level learning dynamics of over-parameterized models to attain a more efficient and fruitful training strategy. Empirical evidence reveals that when scaling down into network modules, such as heads in self-attention models, we can observe varying learning patterns implicitly associated with each module's trainability. To describe such modular-level learning capabilities, we introduce a novel concept dubbed modular neural tangent kernel (mNTK), and we demonstrate that the quality of a module's learning is tightly associated with its mNTK's principal eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\max}$. A large $\\lambda_{\\max}$ indicates that the module learns features with better convergence, while those miniature ones may impact generalization negatively. Inspired by the discovery, we propose a novel training strategy termed Modular Adaptive Training (MAT) to update those modules with their $\\lambda_{\\max}$ exceeding a dynamic threshold selectively, concentrating the model on learning common features and ignoring those inconsistent ones. Unlike most existing training schemes with a complete BP cycle across all network modules, MAT can significantly save computations by its partially-updating strategy and can further improve performance. Experiments show that MAT nearly halves the computational cost of model training and outperforms the accuracy of baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this work, we demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context learning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as quickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration, efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients: (1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic scaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the training task distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform well across ever-larger open-ended domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 89  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3.

However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

Colwell, Adrian Weller*\n\n**TL;DR:** Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness are introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1323  (*Influential: 184*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Extreme Compression for Pre-trained Transformers Made Simple and Efficient\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory compression transformers*\n\n*Xiaoxia Wu, Z. Yao, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective compression pipeline for extreme compression, named XTC, which demonstrates that it can skip the pre-training knowledge distillation to obtain a 5-layer BERT while achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT.\n\n**Abstract:** Extreme compression, particularly ultra-low bit precision (binary/ternary) quantization, has been proposed to fit large NLP models on resource-constraint devices. However, to preserve the accuracy for such aggressive compression schemes, cutting-edge methods usually introduce complicated compression pipelines, e.g., multi-stage expensive knowledge distillation with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Also, they oftentimes focus less on smaller transformer models that have already been heavily compressed via knowledge distillation and lack a systematic study to show the effectiveness of their methods. In this paper, we perform a very comprehensive systematic study to measure the impact of many key hyperparameters and training strategies from previous works. As a result, we find out that previous baselines for ultra-low bit precision quantization are significantly under-trained. Based on our study, we propose a simple yet effective compression pipeline for extreme compression, named XTC. XTC demonstrates that (1) we can skip the pre-training knowledge distillation to obtain a 5-layer BERT while achieving better performance than previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the 6-layer TinyBERT; (2) extreme quantization plus layer reduction is able to reduce the model size by 50x, resulting in new state-of-the-art results on GLUE tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. Memory Efficient Continual Learning with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory compression transformers*\n\n*B. Ermi\u015f, Giovanni Zappella, Martin Wistuba, Aditya Rawal, C. Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Efficient Unsupervised Sentence Compression by Fine-tuning Transformers with Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory compression transformers*\n\n*D. Ghalandari, Chris Hokamp, Georgiana Ifrim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the use of reinforcement learning to train effective sentence compression models that are also fast when generating predictions and outperforms other unsupervised models while also being more efficient at inference time.\n\n**Abstract:** Sentence compression reduces the length of text by removing non-essential content while preserving important facts and grammaticality. Unsupervised objective driven methods for sentence compression can be used to create customized models without the need for ground-truth training data, while allowing flexibility in the objective function(s) that are used for learning and inference. Recent unsupervised sentence compression approaches use custom objectives to guide discrete search; however, guided search is expensive at inference time. In this work, we explore the use of reinforcement learning to train effective sentence compression models that are also fast when generating predictions. In particular, we cast the task as binary sequence labelling and fine-tune a pre-trained transformer using a simple policy gradient approach. Our approach outperforms other unsupervised models while also being more efficient at inference time.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. PermuteFormer: Efficient Relative Position Encoding for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Peng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer\nsequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with\nrelative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position\nencoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position\nencoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a\nPerformer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on\nlong sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long\nsequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The\nexperiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of\nPerformer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla\nTransformer on most of the tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-06T11:49:22Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-08T13:17:49Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 4.

ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory compression transformers*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Conglong Li, Xiaoxia Wu, Minjia Zhang, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 6. Understanding INT4 Quantization for Transformer Models: Latency Speedup, Composability, and Failure Cases\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory compression transformers*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Zhewei Yao, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Cheng Li, Xiaoxia Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the deployment efficiency of transformer-based language models has been challenging given their high computation and memory cost. While INT8 quantization has recently been shown to be effective in reducing both the memory cost and latency while preserving model accuracy, it remains unclear whether we can leverage INT4 (which doubles peak hardware throughput) to achieve further latency improvement. In this study, we explore the feasibility of employing INT4 weight and activation (W4A4) quantization for language models. Our findings indicate that W4A4 quantization introduces no to negligible accuracy degradation for encoder-only and encoder-decoder models, but causes a significant accuracy drop for decoder-only models. To materialize the performance gain using W4A4, we develop a highly optimized end-to-end W4A4 encoder inference pipeline supporting different quantization strategies. Our INT4 pipeline is $8.5\\times$ faster for latency-oriented scenarios and up to $3\\times$ for throughput-oriented scenarios compared to the inference of FP16, and improves the SOTA BERT INT8 performance from FasterTransformer by up to $1.7\\times$. We provide insights into the failure cases when applying W4A4 to decoder-only models, and further explore the compatibility of INT4 quantization with other compression methods, like pruning and layer reduction.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, focusing on adaptive attention scaling, linear attention mechanisms, and efficient memory compression strategies is crucial.

This can be integrated into the GAU framework to improve its adaptability and efficiency.\n\n- **Dynamic Sparse Attention**: The dynamic sparse attention mechanism in CASAK-V and other models like FastGen and SEA, dynamically generates attention masks and adapts sparsity patterns based on input context and task requirements. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n### Implementation Optimizations\n\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Techniques like tiling, used in FlashAttention and similar models, break down attention computations into smaller chunks, reducing memory read/write operations and enhancing cache utilization. This optimization leads to significant speedups in processing long sequences.\n\n- **Reversible Residual Layers**: Incorporating reversible residual layers, as in the Reformer model, reduces memory usage during training by allowing activations to be recomputed on-the-fly rather than stored. This enables deeper models without prohibitive memory costs.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **Lina-Speech**: This model introduces Gated Linear Attention, which replaces traditional self-attention mechanisms with linear attention, achieving linear complexity and competitive performance.\n\n2. **CASAK-V**: This model leverages dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, achieving sub-linear scaling in inference time and near-linear scaling in memory usage.

One issue of the vanilla transformer model lies in\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1e87ac89fa2bec7d4d6fg-01.jpg?height=441&width=780&top_left_y=750&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: TransNORMER has smaller memory footprints (circle sizes) and produces clearly favorable speed ( $x$-axis) and overall scores ( $y$-axis), when evaluated on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark than the vanilla transformer and other competing methods. its quadratic space-time complexity with respect to the input length. Various prior works attempt to alleviate this inefficiency (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b). In this work, we focus on a particular subset of these methods, known as kernel-based linear transformers (Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022) considering their desirable linear space-time complexity. Despite their space-time efficiency, linear transformers are not always in favor for practical adoption, largely due to the degraded performance than the vanilla model. To address this issue, we take a close look at existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify $\\boldsymbol{t w o}$ deficiencies that lead to such a performance gap. Unbounded gradients. Most existing linear transformers inherit attention formulation from the vanilla transformer, which scales attention scores to ensure they are bounded within $[0,1]$. However, we theoretically show that such a scaling strategy\nrenders unbounded gradients for linear transformer models. As a result, the unbounded gradients empirically lead to unstable convergence as our preliminary experiments suggest. Attention dilution. Previous works (Titsias, 2016; Jang et al., 2016; Gao and Pavel, 2017; Qin et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022b,a) suggest that in vanilla transformer, softmax attention maps tend to be local. In contrast, as shown in Fig 2, we observe that linear transformers often trivially distribute attention scores over the entire sequence even in early layers. Due to this issue, which we refer as attention dilution, important local information is less well preserved in linear models, resulting in inferior performance. This negative impact of attention dilution is also evidenced by the performance drop in our controlled experiments if partly replacing vanilla attention in transformer layers with linear attention ones. To mitigate these issues, we propose a linear transformer model, called TrANSNORMER, which shows better performance than vanilla transformer on a wide range of task while being significantly faster during runtime, as shown in Fig. 1. To avoid the unbounded gradients, we introduce NORMATTENTION, which gets rid of scaling over attention matrices while appending an additional normalization only after the attention layer. The choice of the normalization operator is unrestricted, for example, LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016) or RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) both serve the purpose. We show empirical results demonstrating that with Normattention, the gradients are more stable during training, which in turn leads to more consistent convergence. To alleviate the attention dilution issue, we modify the vanilla attention and allow each token to only attend to its neighbouring tokens, resulting in a diagonal attention. To mimic the behaviors on local semantics of the vanilla transformer, we employ the diagonal attention on early layers while using NormAttention for later ones. In this way, we encourage the model to capture both local and global language context. Note that our diagonal attention can be efficiently computed such that the overall linear space-time complexity of TRANSNORMER is preserved. We perform extensive experiments on standard tasks, where TransNORmER demonstrates lower language modeling perplexities on WikiText-103 and overall higher text classification accuracy on\nGLUE than vanilla model and other competing methods. In addition, on the challenging LongRange Arena benchmark, TransNormer also shows favorable results while being faster and more scalable with longer inputs during both training and inference time. ## 2 Background and related work\n\nWe first briefly review vanilla transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) and its efficient variants. The key component of transformers is the self-attention, which operates on query $\\mathbf{Q}$, key $\\mathbf{K}$ and value $\\mathbf{V}$ matrices; each of them is the image of a linear projection taking $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ as input:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{Q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{K}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}\n$$\n\nwith $n$ the input length, $d$ the hidden dimension. The output $\\mathbf{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere the $\\operatorname{Softmax}(\\cdot)$ step renders quadratic spacetime complexity with respect to the input length, making it prohibitive for vanilla transformer to scale to long input sequences. To address this issue, numerous efficient transformers have been explored in the literature. These methods can be generally categorized into two families, i.e., pattern based methods and kernel based methods. Pattern based methods (Zaheer et al., 2020; Beltagy et al., 2020; Tay et al., 2020a; Kitaev et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019) sparsify the attention calculation with handcrafted or learnable masking patterns. Kernel-based methods adopt kernel functions to decompose softmax attention, which reduces the theoretical space-time complexity to linear. In this paper, we refer the kernel-based variants as linear transformers for simplicity. In the kernel-based methods (Choromanski et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020), a kernel function $\\phi(\\cdot)$ maps queries and keys to their hidden representations. Then the output of the linear attention can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{O} & =\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}^{-1} \\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right] \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{\\Delta} & =\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\phi(\\mathbf{Q})\\left[\\phi(\\mathbf{K})^{\\top} \\mathbf{1}_{n}\\right]\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the product of keys and values are computed to avoid the quadratic $n \\times n$ matrix.\n```\n\n#### 2. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field.

The Devil in Linear Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based linear transformers*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Xiaodong Han, Weixuan Sun, Dongxu Li, Lingpeng Kong, Nick Barnes, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new linear attention that replaces the scaling of attention matrices with a normalization to stabilize gradients, and proposes a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear transformers aim to reduce the quadratic space-time complexity of vanilla transformers. However, they usually suffer from degraded performances on various tasks and corpus. In this paper, we examine existing kernel-based linear transformers and identify two key issues that lead to such performance gaps: 1) unbounded gradients in the attention computation adversely impact the convergence of linear transformer models; 2) attention dilution which trivially distributes attention scores over long sequences while neglecting neighbouring structures. To address these issues, we first identify that the scaling of attention matrices is the devil in unbounded gradients, which turns out unnecessary in linear attention as we show theoretically and empirically. To this end, we propose a new linear attention that replaces the scaling operation with a normalization to stabilize gradients. For the issue of attention dilution, we leverage a diagonal attention to confine attention to only neighbouring tokens in early layers. Benefiting from the stable gradients and improved attention, our new linear transformer model, transNormer, demonstrates superior performance on text classification and language modeling tasks, as well as on the challenging Long-Range Arena benchmark, surpassing vanilla transformer and existing linear variants by a clear margin while being significantly more space-time efficient.

SOFT: Softmax-free Transformer with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based linear transformers*\n\n*Jiachen Lu, Jinghan Yao, Junge Zhang, Xiatian Zhu, Hang Xu, Weiguo Gao, Chunjing Xu, T. Xiang, Li Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** For the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed, which significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants and allows much longer token sequences to be permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for various visual recognition tasks by patch-wise image tokenization followed by self-attention. However, the employment of self-attention modules results in a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. Various attempts on approximating the self-attention computation with linear complexity have been made in Natural Language Processing. However, an in-depth analysis in this work shows that they are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We further identify that their limitations are rooted in keeping the softmax self-attention during approximations. Specifically, conventional self-attention is computed by normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors. Keeping this softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. Based on this insight, for the first time, a softmax-free transformer or SOFT is proposed. To remove softmax in self-attention, Gaussian kernel function is used to replace the dot-product similarity without further normalization. This enables a full self-attention matrix to be approximated via a low-rank matrix decomposition. The robustness of the approximation is achieved by calculating its Moore-Penrose inverse using a Newton-Raphson method. Extensive experiments on ImageNet show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. Crucially, with a linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted in SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 133  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 6.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive Connection\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, it is demonstrated SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of tasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the input length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 10. Transformer Dissection: An Unified Understanding for Transformer\u2019s Attention via the Lens of Kernel\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based transformer attention*\n\n*Yao-Hung Hubert Tsai, Shaojie Bai, M. Yamada, Louis-philippe Morency, R. Salakhutdinov*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new formulation of attention via the lens of the kernel is presented, which models the input as a product of symmetric kernels and achieves competitive performance to the current state of the art model with less computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a powerful architecture that achieves superior performance on various sequence learning tasks, including neural machine translation, language understanding, and sequence prediction. At the core of the Transformer is the attention mechanism, which concurrently processes all inputs in the streams. In this paper, we present a new formulation of attention via the lens of the kernel. To be more precise, we realize that the attention can be seen as applying kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the similarities between inputs. This new formulation gives us a better way to understand individual components of the Transformer\u2019s attention, such as the better way to integrate the positional embedding. Another important advantage of our kernel-based formulation is that it paves the way to a larger space of composing Transformer\u2019s attention. As an example, we propose a new variant of Transformer\u2019s attention which models the input as a product of symmetric kernels. This approach achieves competitive performance to the current state of the art model with less computation. In our experiments, we empirically study different kernel construction strategies on two widely used tasks: neural machine translation and sequence prediction.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 213  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 11. Scalable Transformer for PDE Surrogate Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based transformer attention*\n\n*Zijie Li, Dule Shu, A. Farimani*\n\n**TL;DR:** Factorized Transformer(FactFormer), which is based on an axial factorized kernel integral, is proposed, which is able to simulate 2D Kolmogorov flow on a 256 by 256 grid and 3D smoke buoyancy on a 64 by64 by 64 grid with good accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has shown state-of-the-art performance on various applications and has recently emerged as a promising tool for surrogate modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite the introduction of linear-complexity variant, applying attention to a large number of grid points can result in instability and is still expensive to compute. In this work, we propose Factorized Transformer(FactFormer), which is based on an axial factorized kernel integral. Concretely, we introduce a learnable projection operator that decomposes the input function into multiple sub-functions with one-dimensional domain. These sub-functions are then evaluated and used to compute the instance-based kernel with an axial factorized scheme. We showcase that the proposed model is able to simulate 2D Kolmogorov flow on a 256 by 256 grid and 3D smoke buoyancy on a 64 by 64 by 64 grid with good accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we find out that with the factorization scheme, the attention matrices enjoy a more compact spectrum than full softmax-free attention matrices.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 12. KDEformer: Accelerating Transformers via Kernel Density Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based transformer attention*\n\n*A.

Critical bottlenecks are due to the computation of partition functions in the denominator of softmax function as well as the multiplication of the softmax matrix with the matrix of values. Our key observation is that the former can be reduced to a variant of the kernel density estimation (KDE) problem, and an efficient KDE solver can be further utilized to accelerate the latter via subsampling-based fast matrix products. Our proposed KDEformer can approximate the attention in sub-quadratic time with provable spectral norm bounds, while all prior results merely provide entry-wise error bounds. Empirically, we verify that KDEformer outperforms other attention approximations in terms of accuracy, memory, and runtime on various pre-trained models. On BigGAN image generation, we achieve better generative scores than the exact computation with over $4\\times$ speedup. For ImageNet classification with T2T-ViT, KDEformer shows over $18\\times$ speedup while the accuracy drop is less than $0.5\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 13.

Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 303  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 14. Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention transformers*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based linear transformers*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based linear transformers*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal.

Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 6.

DSVT: Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer with Rotated Sets\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention transformers*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Bernt Schiele, Di He, Sen Wang, Meng Lei, Shaoshuai Shi, Chen Shi, Haiyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing an efficient yet deployment-friendly 3D backbone to handle sparse point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D perception. Compared with the customized sparse convolution, the attention mechanism in Transformers is more appropriate for flexibly modeling long-range relationships and is easier to be deployed in real-world applications. However, due to the sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse points. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a single-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D perception. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local regions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features of all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection, we design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support effective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose an attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and deployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a broad range of 3D perception tasks. More importantly, DSVT can be easily deployed by TensorRT with real-time inference speed (27Hz).

DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention transformers*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie zhou, Jiwen Lu, Benlin Liu, Wenliang Zhao, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention enhancements*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 3.

However, these models, predominantly based on transformers, are difficult to scale to long documents as their attention layers have quadratic complexity in the sequence length. Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias. We evaluate the model on IWSLT 2015 and OpenSubtitles 2018 against the transformer, demonstrating substantially increased decoding speed on long sequences with similar or better BLEU scores.

Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention optimizations*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F. Tonin, J. Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization, and demonstrates that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-ATTention.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a new line of works has emerged to understand and improve self-attention in Transformers by treating it as a kernel machine. However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Improved Convergence Rates for Sparse Approximation Methods in Kernel-Based Learning\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention optimizations*\n\n*Sattar Vakili, J. Scarlett, Da-shan Shiu, A. Bernacchia*\n\n**TL;DR:** Novel confidence intervals are provided for the Nystr\\\"om method and the sparse variational Gaussian process approximation method, which are established using novel interpretations of the approximate (surrogate) posterior variance of the models.\n\n**Abstract:** Kernel-based models such as kernel ridge regression and Gaussian processes are ubiquitous in machine learning applications for regression and optimization. It is well known that a major downside for kernel-based models is the high computational cost; given a dataset of $n$ samples, the cost grows as $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. Existing sparse approximation methods can yield a significant reduction in the computational cost, effectively reducing the actual cost down to as low as $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ in certain cases. Despite this remarkable empirical success, significant gaps remain in the existing results for the analytical bounds on the error due to approximation. In this work, we provide novel confidence intervals for the Nystr\\\"om method and the sparse variational Gaussian process approximation method, which we establish using novel interpretations of the approximate (surrogate) posterior variance of the models. Our confidence intervals lead to improved performance bounds in both regression and optimization problems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Self-Attention through Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention optimizations*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F. Tonin, J. Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired.\n\n**Abstract:** While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive Connection\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention strategies*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, it is demonstrated SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of tasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the input length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 10. Mixture of Attention Heads: Selecting Attention Heads Per Token\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic gating mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Xiaofeng Zhang, Yikang Shen, Zeyu Huang, Jie Zhou, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism, is proposed, which can easily scale up the number of attention heads and theNumber of parameters while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks have been proposed as an efficient way to scale up model capacity and implement conditional computing. However, the study of MoE components mostly focused on the feedforward layer in Transformer architecture. This paper proposes the Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism. MoA includes a set of attention heads that each has its own set of parameters. Given an input, a router dynamically selects a subset of k attention heads per token. This conditional computation schema allows MoA to achieve stronger performance than the standard multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, the sparsely gated MoA can easily scale up the number of attention heads and the number of parameters while preserving computational efficiency. Despite performance improvements, MoA also automatically differentiates heads\u2019 utilities, providing a new perspective to discuss the model\u2019s interpretability.

One of these phenomena, Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC), has gained considerable attention due to the intriguing observation that different solutions can be connected by a linear path in the parameter space while maintaining near-constant training and test losses. In this work, we introduce a stronger notion of linear connectivity, Layerwise Linear Feature Connectivity (LLFC), which says that the feature maps of every layer in different trained networks are also linearly connected. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence for LLFC across a wide range of settings, demonstrating that whenever two trained networks satisfy LMC (via either spawning or permutation methods), they also satisfy LLFC in nearly all the layers. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the underlying factors contributing to LLFC, which reveal new insights into the spawning and permutation approaches. The study of LLFC transcends and advances our understanding of LMC by adopting a feature-learning perspective.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 12. Spherical Structured Feature Maps for Kernel Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: kernel feature maps for linear attention*\n\n*Yueming Lyu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient coordinate decent method is proposed to find a local optimum of the discrete Riesz s-energy for SSF maps construction to approximate shift and rotation invariant kernels as well as b-order arc-cosine kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Spherical Structured Feature (SSF) maps to approximate shift and rotation invariant kernels as well as b-order arc-cosine kernels (Cho & Saul, 2009). We construct SSF maps based on the point set on d \u2212 1 dimensional sphere Sd\u22121. We prove that the inner product of SSF maps are unbiased estimates for above kernels if asymptotically uniformly distributed point set on Sd\u22121 is given. According to (Brauchart & Grabner, 2015), optimizing the discrete Riesz s-energy can generate asymptotically uniformly distributed point set on Sd\u22121. Thus, we propose an efficient coordinate decent method to find a local optimum of the discrete Riesz s-energy for SSF maps construction. Theoretically, SSF maps construction achieves linear space complexity and loglinear time complexity. Empirically, SSF maps achieve superior performance compared with other methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 13.

Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 14. Sparse DETR: Efficient End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: selective sparse attention in transformers*\n\n*Byungseok Roh, Jaewoong Shin, Wuhyun Shin, Saehoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparse DETR is proposed that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder to help the model effectively detect objects and achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** DETR is the first end-to-end object detector using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and demonstrates competitive performance but low computational efficiency on high resolution feature maps. The subsequent work, Deformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention with deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved performance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to DETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck. In our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly deteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by this observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model effectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary detection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance while minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total computation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by 42% compared to Deformable DETR.

Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention enhancements*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Product-based Neural Networks for User Response Prediction over Multi-field Categorical Data\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention optimizations*\n\n*Wei-Nan Zhang, Bohui Fang, Ruiming Tang, Huifeng Guo, Yong Yu, Minzhe Niu, Yanru Qu, Xiuqiang He*\n\n**Abstract:** User response prediction is a crucial component for personalized information\nretrieval and filtering scenarios, such as recommender system and web search.\nThe data in user response prediction is mostly in a multi-field categorical\nformat and transformed into sparse representations via one-hot encoding. Due to\nthe sparsity problems in representation and optimization, most research focuses\non feature engineering and shallow modeling. Recently, deep neural networks\nhave attracted research attention on such a problem for their high capacity and\nend-to-end training scheme. In this paper, we study user response prediction in\nthe scenario of click prediction. We first analyze a coupled gradient issue in\nlatent vector-based models and propose kernel product to learn field-aware\nfeature interactions. Then we discuss an insensitive gradient issue in\nDNN-based models and propose Product-based Neural Network (PNN) which adopts a\nfeature extractor to explore feature interactions.

MInference 1.0: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context LLMs via Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based attention optimizations*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Amir H. Abdi, Zhenhua Han, Surin Ahn, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chengruidong Zhang, Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

TransFusion: Robust LiDAR-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention strategies*\n\n*Chiew-Lan Tai, Hongbo Fu, Yilun Chen, Qingqiu Huang, Xinge Zhu, Zeyu Hu, Xuyang Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** LiDAR and camera are two important sensors for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. Despite the increasing popularity of sensor fusion in this field, the robustness against inferior image conditions, e.g., bad illumination and sensor misalignment, is under-explored. Existing fusion methods are easily affected by such conditions, mainly due to a hard association of LiDAR points and image pixels, established by calibration matrices. We propose TransFusion, a robust solution to LiDAR-camera fusion with a soft-association mechanism to handle inferior image conditions. Specifically, our TransFusion consists of convolutional backbones and a detection head based on a transformer decoder. The first layer of the decoder predicts initial bounding boxes from a LiDAR point cloud using a sparse set of object queries, and its second decoder layer adaptively fuses the object queries with useful image features, leveraging both spatial and contextual relationships. The attention mechanism of the transformer enables our model to adaptively determine where and what information should be taken from the image, leading to a robust and effective fusion strategy. We additionally design an image-guided query initialization strategy to deal with objects that are difficult to detect in point clouds. TransFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. We provide extensive experiments to demonstrate its robustness against degenerated image quality and calibration errors. We also extend the proposed method to the 3D tracking task and achieve the 1st place in the leaderboard of nuScenes tracking, showing its effectiveness and generalization capability.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-22\n\n\n\n#### 6. Adaptive Context-Aware Multi-Modal Network for Depth Completion\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention strategies*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Mingming Gong, Huan Fu, Shanshan Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Depth completion aims to recover a dense depth map from the sparse depth data and the corresponding single RGB image. The observed pixels provide the significant guidance for the recovery of the unobserved pixels' depth. However, due to the sparsity of the depth data, the standard convolution operation, exploited by most of existing methods, is not effective to model the observed contexts with depth values. To address this issue, we propose to adopt the graph propagation to capture the observed spatial contexts. Specifically, we first construct multiple graphs at different scales from observed pixels. Since the graph structure varies from sample to sample, we then apply the attention mechanism on the propagation, which encourages the network to model the contextual information adaptively. Furthermore, considering the mutli-modality of input data, we exploit the graph propagation on the two modalities respectively to extract multi-modal representations. Finally, we introduce the symmetric gated fusion strategy to exploit the extracted multi-modal features effectively. The proposed strategy preserves the original information for one modality and also absorbs complementary information from the other through learning the adaptive gating weights. Our model, named Adaptive Context-Aware Multi-Modal Network (ACMNet), achieves the state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks, {\\it i.e.}, KITTI and NYU-v2, and at the same time has fewer parameters than latest models.

Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic gating mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 8. LiDAR-based Online 3D Video Object Detection with Graph-based Message Passing and Spatiotemporal Transformer Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic gating mechanisms in transformers*\n\n*Jianbing Shen, Ruigang Yang, Chenye Guan, Junbo Yin, Dingfu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors usually focus on the single-frame detection, while ignoring the spatiotemporal information in consecutive point cloud frames. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end online 3D video object detector that operates on point cloud sequences. The proposed model comprises a spatial feature encoding component and a spatiotemporal feature aggregation component. In the former component, a novel Pillar Message Passing Network (PMPNet) is proposed to encode each discrete point cloud frame. It adaptively collects information for a pillar node from its neighbors by iterative message passing, which effectively enlarges the receptive field of the pillar feature. In the latter component, we propose an Attentive Spatiotemporal Transformer GRU (AST-GRU) to aggregate the spatiotemporal information, which enhances the conventional ConvGRU with an attentive memory gating mechanism. AST-GRU contains a Spatial Transformer Attention (STA) module and a Temporal Transformer Attention (TTA) module, which can emphasize the foreground objects and align the dynamic objects, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed 3D video object detector achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale nuScenes benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** lidar-based-online-3d-video-object-detection-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-03\n\n\n\n#### 9. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel feature maps for linear attention*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Angelos Katharopoulos, Nikolaos Pappas, Apoorv Vyas*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-29\n\n\n\n#### 10.

We further introduce StarNet, a simple yet powerful prototype, demonstrating impressive performance and low latency under compact network structure and efficient budget. Like stars in the sky, the star operation appears unremarkable but holds a vast universe of potential.

Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit Selection\n\n*From Search Query: selective sparse attention in transformers*\n\n*Xu sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Qi Su, Junyang Lin, Xuancheng Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art performances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention is able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction of irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}. Explicit Sparse Transformer is able to improve the concentration of attention on the global context through an explicit selection of the most relevant segments. Extensive experimental results on a series of natural language processing and computer vision tasks, including neural machine translation, image captioning, and language modeling, all demonstrate the advantages of Explicit Sparse Transformer in model performance. We also show that our proposed sparse attention method achieves comparable or better results than the previous sparse attention method, but significantly reduces training and testing time. For example, the inference speed is twice that of sparsemax in Transformer model.

Vision Transformer with Deformable Attention\n\n*From Search Query: selective sparse attention in transformers*\n\n*Gao Huang, Li Erran Li, Shiji Song, Xuran Pan, Zhuofan Xia*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have recently shown superior performances on various vision tasks. The large, sometimes even global, receptive field endows Transformer models with higher representation power over their CNN counterparts. Nevertheless, simply enlarging receptive field also gives rise to several concerns. On the one hand, using dense attention e.g., in ViT, leads to excessive memory and computational cost, and features can be influenced by irrelevant parts which are beyond the region of interests. On the other hand, the sparse attention adopted in PVT or Swin Transformer is data agnostic and may limit the ability to model long range relations. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel deformable self-attention module, where the positions of key and value pairs in self-attention are selected in a data-dependent way. This flexible scheme enables the self-attention module to focus on relevant regions and capture more informative features. On this basis, we present Deformable Attention Transformer, a general backbone model with deformable attention for both image classification and dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments show that our models achieve consistently improved results on comprehensive benchmarks.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 227  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/38 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nAssociation for Computing Machinery.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Kaizhao Liang, Jiaming Yang, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 3.

Recent efforts on training and deploying Transformers more efficiently have identified many strategies to approximate the self-attention matrix, a key module in a Transformer architecture. Effective ideas include various prespecified sparsity patterns, low-rank basis expansions and combinations thereof. In this paper, we revisit classical Multiresolution Analysis (MRA) concepts such as Wavelets, whose potential value in this setting remains underexplored thus far. We show that simple approximations based on empirical feedback and design choices informed by modern hardware and implementation challenges, eventually yield a MRA-based approach for self-attention with an excellent performance profile across most criteria of interest. We undertake an extensive set of experiments and demonstrate that this multi-resolution scheme outperforms most efficient self-attention proposals and is favorable for both short and long sequences.

Towards More Efficient Stochastic Decentralized Learning: Faster Convergence and Sparse Communication\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Zebang Shen, Aryan Mokhtari, Tengfei Zhou, P.

Most existing methods are deterministic with high per-iteration cost and have a convergence rate quadratically depending on the problem condition number. Besides, the dense communication is necessary to ensure the convergence even if the dataset is sparse. In this paper, we generalize the decentralized optimization problem to a monotone operator root finding problem, and propose a stochastic algorithm named DSBA that (i) converges geometrically with a rate linearly depending on the problem condition number, and (ii) can be implemented using sparse communication only. Additionally, DSBA handles learning problems like AUC-maximization which cannot be tackled efficiently in the decentralized setting. Experiments on convex minimization and AUC-maximization validate the efficiency of our method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5.

However, explorations on such relationships are limited. Most works pay attention to some common mathematical properties, such as sparsity. In this work, we propose a new type of implicit model inspired by the designing of the systems\u2019 hidden objective functions, called the Multi-branch Optimization induced Equilibrium networks (MOptEqs). The model architecture is designed based on modelling the hidden objective function for the multi-resolution recognition task. Furthermore, we also pro-pose a new strategy inspired by our understandings of the hidden objective function. In this manner, the proposed model can better utilize the hierarchical patterns for recognition tasks and retain the abilities for interpreting the whole structure as trying to obtain the minima of the problem\u2019s goal. Comparing with the state-of-the-art models, our MOptEqs not only enjoys better explainability but are also superior to MDEQ with less parameter consumption and better performance on practical tasks.

Spyx: A Library for Just-In-Time Compiled Optimization of Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Thomas Nowotny, Kade M. Heckel*\n\n**Abstract:** As the role of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pivotal in modern society, the efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks have emerged as critical areas of focus. Recent advancements in attention-based large neural architectures have spurred the development of AI accelerators, facilitating the training of extensive, multi-billion parameter models. Despite their effectiveness, these powerful networks often incur high execution costs in production environments. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural processes, offers a promising alternative. By utilizing temporally-sparse computations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer to enhance energy efficiency through a reduced and low-power hardware footprint. However, the training of SNNs can be challenging due to their recurrent nature which cannot as easily leverage the massive parallelism of modern AI accelerators. To facilitate the investigation of SNN architectures and dynamics researchers have sought to bridge Python-based deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow with custom-implemented compute kernels. This paper introduces Spyx, a new and lightweight SNN simulation and optimization library designed in JAX. By pre-staging data in the expansive vRAM of contemporary accelerators and employing extensive JIT compilation, Spyx allows for SNN optimization to be executed as a unified, low-level program on NVIDIA GPUs or Google TPUs. This approach achieves optimal hardware utilization, surpassing the performance of many existing SNN training frameworks while maintaining considerable flexibility.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Fast Inner-Product Algorithms and Architectures for Deep Neural Network Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Nicola Nicolici, Trevor E. Pogue*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new algorithm called the Free-pipeline Fast Inner Product (FFIP) and its hardware architecture that improve an under-explored fast inner-product algorithm (FIP) proposed by Winograd in 1968. Unlike the unrelated Winograd minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional layers, FIP is applicable to all machine learning (ML) model layers that can mainly decompose to matrix multiplication, including fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent, and attention/transformer layers. We implement FIP for the first time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget. Our FFIP implementation for non-sparse ML models with 8 to 16-bit fixed-point inputs achieves higher throughput and compute efficiency than the best-in-class prior solutions on the same type of compute platform.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. TRIP: Trainable Region-of-Interest Prediction for Hardware-Efficient Neuromorphic Processing on Event-based Vision\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization sparse attention implementation*\n\n*Guangzhi Tang, Amirreza Yousefzadeh, Manolis Sifalakis, Paul Detterer, Kanishkan Vadivel, Alexandra F. Dobrita, Kevin Shidqi, Yingfu Xu, Cina Arjmand*\n\n**Abstract:** Neuromorphic processors are well-suited for efficiently handling sparse events from event-based cameras. However, they face significant challenges in the growth of computing demand and hardware costs as the input resolution increases. This paper proposes the Trainable Region-of-Interest Prediction (TRIP), the first hardware-efficient hard attention framework for event-based vision processing on a neuromorphic processor. Our TRIP framework actively produces low-resolution Region-of-Interest (ROIs) for efficient and accurate classification. The framework exploits sparse events' inherent low information density to reduce the overhead of ROI prediction. We introduced extensive hardware-aware optimizations for TRIP and implemented the hardware-optimized algorithm on the SENECA neuromorphic processor. We utilized multiple event-based classification datasets for evaluation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracies in all datasets and produces reasonable ROIs with varying locations and sizes. On the DvsGesture dataset, our solution requires 46x less computation than the state-of-the-art while achieving higher accuracy. Furthermore, TRIP enables more than 2x latency and energy improvements on the SENECA neuromorphic processor compared to the conventional solution.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-specific optimizations for sparse attention mechanisms, efficient attention computation, memory access patterns, and integration with existing architectures, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations for Sparse Attention\n\n- The paper on \"SeerAttention\" introduces a block-sparse attention mechanism that is optimized for modern hardware like GPUs. It customizes the FlashAttention kernel to extract block-wise attention map information, reducing I/O and computation overhead by skipping non-activated blocks. This approach achieves a significant speedup of 5.47\u00d7 compared to FlashAttention-2 on a single A100 GPU.\n\n- The \"CASAK-V\" paper presents a Context-Aware adaptive Sparse Attention mechanism that dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns. This method uses a custom CUDA kernel to efficiently handle sparse matrix multiplication and softmax operations, which is crucial for hardware optimization. It also implements adaptive chunk-wise KV-cache compression, balancing computational efficiency and memory usage.\n\n## Implementation Details of Efficient Attention Computation\n\n- The \"Reducing the O\u2062(n\u00b2) Cost of Self Attention at the Threadblock Level\" paper discusses the development of fused neighborhood attention, which simplifies the operations into primary operators that can be implemented as batched GEMM kernels with fused gather/scatter operations. This approach reduces the quadratic time complexity of self-attention to linear complexity and minimizes memory footprint, making it highly efficient for modern architectures.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper details the implementation of block-sparse FlashAttention using Triton, where Q is split across different warps, and each warp loads the corresponding K and V blocks on-chip for computation. This method efficiently reduces both I/O and computation overhead by skipping non-activated blocks.\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Cache Utilization Strategies\n\n- The \"Reducing the O\u2062(n\u00b2) Cost of Self Attention at the Threadblock Level\" paper highlights the importance of reducing global memory accesses and memory usage through fused attention kernels. These implementations turn dot product attention into a compute-bound problem at scale by keeping attention weights in on-chip memory until the second matrix multiplication is performed.\n\n- The \"CASAK-V\" paper emphasizes the use of adaptive chunk-wise KV-cache compression, which periodically re-evaluates the importance scores for all cached pairs and adjusts compression ratios. This approach ensures efficient memory usage and maintains context-awareness during long-sequence processing.\n\n## Integration with Existing Architectures\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" paper integrates the block-sparse attention mechanism with the FlashAttention kernel, which is widely used in deep learning frameworks. This integration allows for seamless adoption in existing model architectures without significant modifications.\n\n- The \"CASAK-V\" paper demonstrates how the dynamic sparse attention mechanism can be integrated with pre-trained transformer models, such as the LLaMA-3-70B-128k model, while maintaining competitive performance and reducing memory usage and inference time.\n\nThese findings and references provide practical implementation details, hardware utilization metrics, and optimization techniques that can help researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models by leveraging sparse attention mechanisms efficiently.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers.

The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1348  (*Influential: 181*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 4. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** SEA is proposed: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask, which estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 176  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-scale Attention Network for Single Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Xiaoguang Liu, Gang Wang, Yusen Li, Yan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** ConvNets can compete with transformers in high-level tasks by exploiting larger receptive fields. To unleash the potential of ConvNet in super-resolution, we propose a multi-scale attention network (MAN), by coupling classical multi-scale mechanism with emerging large kernel attention. In particular, we proposed multi-scale large kernel attention (MLKA) and gated spatial attention unit (GSAU). Through our MLKA, we modify large kernel attention with multi-scale and gate schemes to obtain the abundant attention map at various granularity levels, thereby aggregating global and local information and avoiding potential blocking artifacts. In GSAU, we integrate gate mechanism and spatial attention to remove the unnecessary linear layer and aggregate informative spatial context. To confirm the effectiveness of our designs, we evaluate MAN with multiple complexities by simply stacking different numbers of MLKA and GSAU. Experimental results illustrate that our MAN can perform on par with SwinIR and achieve varied trade-offs between state-of-the-art performance and computations.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. ViG: Linear-complexity Visual Sequence Learning with Gated Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Chang Huang, Qian Zhang, Lianghui Zhu, Xinggang Wang, Bencheng Liao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, linear complexity sequence modeling networks have achieved modeling capabilities similar to Vision Transformers on a variety of computer vision tasks, while using fewer FLOPs and less memory. However, their advantage in terms of actual runtime speed is not significant. To address this issue, we introduce Gated Linear Attention (GLA) for vision, leveraging its superior hardware-awareness and efficiency. We propose direction-wise gating to capture 1D global context through bidirectional modeling and a 2D gating locality injection to adaptively inject 2D local details into 1D global context. Our hardware-aware implementation further merges forward and backward scanning into a single kernel, enhancing parallelism and reducing memory cost and latency. The proposed model, ViG, offers a favorable trade-off in accuracy, parameters, and FLOPs on ImageNet and downstream tasks, outperforming popular Transformer and CNN-based models. Notably, ViG-S matches DeiT-B's accuracy while using only 27% of the parameters and 20% of the FLOPs, running 2$\\times$ faster on $224\\times224$ images. At $1024\\times1024$ resolution, ViG-T uses 5.2$\\times$ fewer FLOPs, saves 90% GPU memory, runs 4.8$\\times$ faster, and achieves 20.7% higher top-1 accuracy than DeiT-T. These results position ViG as an efficient and scalable solution for visual representation learning.

LKFormer: Large Kernel Transformer for Infrared Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention kernel transformers*\n\n*Kai Zhang, Yong Peng, Ruiquan Ge, Changmiao Wang, Kang Yan, Feiwei Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Given the broad application of infrared technology across diverse fields, there is an increasing emphasis on investigating super-resolution techniques for infrared images within the realm of deep learning. Despite the impressive results of current Transformer-based methods in image super-resolution tasks, their reliance on the self-attentive mechanism intrinsic to the Transformer architecture results in images being treated as one-dimensional sequences, thereby neglecting their inherent two-dimensional structure. Moreover, infrared images exhibit a uniform pixel distribution and a limited gradient range, posing challenges for the model to capture effective feature information. Consequently, we suggest a potent Transformer model, termed Large Kernel Transformer (LKFormer), to address this issue. Specifically, we have designed a Large Kernel Residual Attention (LKRA) module with linear complexity. This mainly employs depth-wise convolution with large kernels to execute non-local feature modeling, thereby substituting the standard self-attentive layer. Additionally, we have devised a novel feed-forward network structure called Gated-Pixel Feed-Forward Network (GPFN) to augment the LKFormer's capacity to manage the information flow within the network. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that our method surpasses the most advanced techniques available, using fewer parameters and yielding considerably superior performance.The source code will be available at https://github.com/sad192/large-kernel-Transformer.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using gated linear attention, kernel-based approximations, and adaptive sparse attention, here are some key findings and discussions from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementations and Performance of Gated Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**: GLA introduces a data-dependent structured gating mechanism that modulates the contribution of past states. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results in linear-complexity language modeling, often matching or surpassing traditional transformer models, especially on long sequences. GLA is hardware-efficient, enabling higher inference throughput and constant memory footprint, making it suitable for tasks like audio modeling, streaming, or on-device applications.\n\n- **Efficiency and Accuracy Trade-offs**: GLA maintains a linear time complexity during inference and reduces the quadratic time complexity of parallel forms seen in traditional self-attention. This is achieved through a gating mechanism and chunk-wise computation, which enhances hardware efficiency without significant performance degradation.\n\n## Kernel-based Approximations in Transformer Models\n\n- **Linear Attention**: This method replaces the softmax in self-attention with a general kernel function and its associated feature map, reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. The choice of the kernel function is crucial, and recent research has shown that using a linear kernel can simplify the computation while maintaining performance.\n\n- **Gated Linear Transformers (GaLiTe)**: GaLiTe introduces a learnable feature map and a gating mechanism to address limitations of linear transformers, such as the inability to delete past information and the dependency on the choice of kernel feature maps. This approach ensures that the self-attention mechanism can learn a highly parallelizable feature map, which is amenable to sequential computation with context-independent inference cost.\n\n## Integration of Sparse Attention with Linear Transformers\n\n- While the sources do not explicitly discuss the integration of sparse attention with linear transformers, they do highlight the efficiency gains of linear attention mechanisms. For instance, **FlashLinearAttention** and **HBM-efficient linear attention** optimize memory access and usage, which could be extended to incorporate sparse attention methods to further reduce computational complexity.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **FlashAttention and FlashLinearAttention**: These methods optimize attention computation to utilize high-speed on-chip SRAM while minimizing access to slower high-bandwidth memory (HBM), significantly enhancing efficiency. The straightforward implementation of linear attention already achieves linear HBM access, matching the performance of optimized FlashLinearAttention.\n\n- **Chunk-wise Computation**: GLA leverages chunk-wise computation to enhance hardware efficiency, allowing for higher inference throughput compared to similar-sized transformer models on long sequences.\n\n## Efficiency Metrics, Accuracy Trade-offs, and Scalability Analysis\n\n- **Efficiency Metrics**: GLA and GaLiTe achieve linear time complexity, which is independent of the sequence length and only depends on static hyperparameters. This makes them highly efficient for long sequences and suitable for tasks requiring real-time processing.\n\n- **Accuracy Trade-offs**: The introduction of gating mechanisms and learnable feature maps in GLA and GaLiTe helps maintain or even improve the accuracy compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms, despite the reduction in computational complexity.\n\n- **Scalability Analysis**: These models are designed to handle long sequences efficiently and scale well with model size. The constant memory footprint and linear time complexity ensure that they remain efficient even with larger models and longer sequences.\n\nIn summary, the integration of gated linear attention, kernel-based approximations, and potential adaptive sparse attention mechanisms offers a promising approach to improving autoregressive language models. These methods provide significant efficiency gains without compromising accuracy, making them scalable and suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/39 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

Score: 0.96)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

Easy and Efficient Transformer: Scalable Inference Solution For Large NLP Model\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*GongZheng Li, Yadong Xi, Jingzhen Ding, Duan Wang, Bai Liu, Changjie Fan, Xiaoxi Mao, Zeng Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels, and a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, large-scale transformer-based models have been proven to be effective over various tasks across many domains. Nevertheless, applying them in industrial production requires tedious and heavy works to reduce inference costs. To fill such a gap, we introduce a scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels. First, we design highly optimized kernels for long inputs and large hidden sizes. Second, we propose a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model. Compared with the state-of-the-art transformer inference library (Faster Transformer v4.0), EET can achieve an average of 1.40-4.20x speedup on the transformer decoder layer with an A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. One-Inlier is First: Towards Efficient Position Encoding for Point Cloud Registration\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*Fan Yang, Lin Guo, Zhi Chen, Wenbing Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** OIF-PCR, a one-inlier based position encoding method for point cloud registration network is proposed, requiring only a small addition of memory and computing overhead and can achieve competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods in both indoor and outdoor scenes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has shown great potential for many visual tasks, including point cloud registration. As an order-aware module, position encoding plays an important role in Transformer architecture applied to point cloud registration task. In this paper, we propose OIF-PCR, a one-inlier based position encoding method for point cloud registration network. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst \ufb01nd one correspondence by a differentiable optimal transport layer, and use it to normalize each point for position encoding. It can eliminate the challenges brought by the different reference frames of two point clouds, and mitigate the feature ambiguity by learning the spatial consistency. Then, we propose a joint approach for establishing correspondence and position encoding, presenting an iterative optimization process. Finally, we design a progressive way for point cloud alignment and feature learning to gradually optimize the rigid transformation. The proposed position encoding is very ef\ufb01cient, requiring only a small addition of memory and computing overhead.

NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*Yong Guo, Yin Zheng, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, P. Zhao, Junzhou Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer optimization*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Conglong Li, Xiaoxia Wu, Minjia Zhang, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory efficiency, efficient implementations of attention mechanisms, hardware-aware optimization strategies, and cache utilization, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The **Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT)** introduced in is a method that partitions input sequences into mini-sequences to reduce intermediate memory usage. This approach integrates activation recomputation, which significantly reduces memory requirements during both the forward and backward passes. MsT is shown to maintain throughput and convergence even with sequences 12 times longer than standard implementations, making it highly memory-efficient.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Bidirectional Transformers** discussed in highlight architectural modifications such as parallel layer execution and the omission of biases in QKV projections and LayerNorms. These changes can reduce training time and optimize resource utilization, leading to a more efficient model.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Linear Transformers** and variants like **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)** are efficient alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms. GLA, as mentioned in the analysis, is especially effective at length generalization and reduces complexity while maintaining performance.\n\n- The **Informer**, **Autoformer**, and **FEDformer** models, as listed in, have complexities of \\(O(L \\log L)\\) or \\(O(L)\\), which are more efficient than the \\(O(L^2)\\) complexity of traditional transformers. These models are designed to handle long sequences more efficiently.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization Strategies\n\n- **Hardware Performance Optimization** in the context of long sequence training is discussed in. The paper highlights the importance of optimizing memory access patterns, particularly on GPUs with their memory hierarchy. Techniques like kernel fusion (Flashattention) and optimized memory access patterns (Xformer) are mentioned as effective strategies to mitigate memory overheads.\n\n- **Tensor Core Usage** and efficient matrix multiplication, as discussed in, are crucial for optimizing transformer computations on hardware like NVIDIA GPUs. Utilizing tensor cores for generalized matrix multiplication (GEMM) can significantly speed up transformer computations.\n\n## Cache Utilization and Memory Access Patterns\n\n- The **Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT)** analysis in includes a detailed examination of memory efficiency and IO complexity. By partitioning sequences and using activation recomputation, MsT reduces the peak memory usage, which is critical for avoiding out-of-memory (OOM) issues and optimizing cache utilization.\n\n- **Memory Hierarchy** considerations are important, as noted in. The paper discusses how GPUs have a memory hierarchy with global GPU memory (HBM) and shared memory (SRAM), and how optimizing memory access patterns can help in managing the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations.\n\nThese findings and techniques can help researchers in improving the memory efficiency, reducing computational complexity, and optimizing hardware utilization for autoregressive language models, aligning with the goals outlined in the GALA-Trafo proposal.\n",

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information.

Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.92)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Efficient Sparse Attention needs Adaptive Token Release\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Chaoran Zhang, Lixin Zou, Dan Luo, Min Tang, Xiangyang Luo, Zihao Li, Chenliang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that the adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states of the transformer achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of text-centric tasks. However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Long-range Sequence Modeling with Predictable Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Yimeng Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Mei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling, which remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been shown to be an effective approach for capturing global context dependencies in sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic complexity in time and memory usage. Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Accurate Image Restoration with Attention Retractable Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Jiale Zhang, Yulun Zhang, Jinjin Gu, Yongbing Zhang, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** Attention Retractable Transformer (ART) is proposed for image restoration, which presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network, which greatly enhances representation ability of Transformer while providing retractable attention on the input image.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based image restoration networks have achieved promising improvements over convolutional neural networks due to parameter-independent global interactions. To lower computational cost, existing works generally limit self-attention computation within non-overlapping windows. However, each group of tokens are always from a dense area of the image. This is considered as a dense attention strategy since the interactions of tokens are restrained in dense regions. Obviously, this strategy could result in restricted receptive fields. To address this issue, we propose Attention Retractable Transformer (ART) for image restoration, which presents both dense and sparse attention modules in the network. The sparse attention module allows tokens from sparse areas to interact and thus provides a wider receptive field. Furthermore, the alternating application of dense and sparse attention modules greatly enhances representation ability of Transformer while providing retractable attention on the input image.We conduct extensive experiments on image super-resolution, denoising, and JPEG compression artifact reduction tasks. Experimental results validate that our proposed ART outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets both quantitatively and visually.

OA-CNNs: Omni-Adaptive Sparse CNNs for 3D Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Jiaya Jia, Zhuotao Tian, Hengshuang Zhao, Yukang Chen, Li Jiang, Xiaoyang Wu, Bohao Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** The booming of 3D recognition in the 2020s began with the introduction of point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models, especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However, sparse CNNs are still valuable networks, due to their efficiency treasure, and ease of application. In this work, we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically, we propose two key components, i.e., adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation, to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs), a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules, OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes, with much less latency and memory cost. Notably, it achieves 76.1%, 78.9%, and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2, nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively, while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Slide-Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Local Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Zhuofan Xia, Tianzhu Ye, Xuran Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the recent progress of Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global contexts. However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks.

Learning A Sparse Transformer Network for Effective Image Deraining\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformer benchmarks*\n\n*Jinshan Pan, Mingqiang Li, Hao Li, Xiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based methods have achieved significant performance in image deraining as they can model the non-local information which is vital for high-quality image reconstruction. In this paper, we find that most existing Transformers usually use all similarities of the tokens from the query-key pairs for the feature aggregation. However, if the tokens from the query are different from those of the key, the self-attention values estimated from these tokens also involve in feature aggregation, which accordingly interferes with the clear image restoration. To overcome this problem, we propose an effective DeRaining network, Sparse Transformer (DRSformer) that can adaptively keep the most useful self-attention values for feature aggregation so that the aggregated features better facilitate high-quality image reconstruction. Specifically, we develop a learnable top-k selection operator to adaptively retain the most crucial attention scores from the keys for each query for better feature aggregation. Simultaneously, as the naive feed-forward network in Transformers does not model the multi-scale information that is important for latent clear image restoration, we develop an effective mixed-scale feed-forward network to generate better features for image deraining. To learn an enriched set of hybrid features, which combines local context from CNN operators, we equip our model with mixture of experts feature compensator to present a cooperation refinement deraining scheme. Extensive experimental results on the commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches. The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/cschenxiang/DRSformer.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive sparse attention mechanisms, efficient transformer variants, and integration strategies, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Metrics of Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Selective Attention\nThe paper on \"Selective Attention\" introduces a parameter-free modification to the standard attention mechanism that reduces attention to unneeded elements. This approach improves language modeling performance across various model sizes and context lengths, and it significantly reduces memory and compute requirements during inference. For example, transformers with selective attention can achieve the same validation perplexity as standard transformers with twice the number of heads and parameters, while using 16X to 47X less memory for the attention module depending on the context size.\n\n### SeerAttention\nSeerAttention is another approach that leverages dynamic sparse attention and adaptive sparsity ratios. It outperforms previous sparse attention methods like Minference and MoA, especially in long-context fine-tuning. SeerAttention achieves near-lossless accuracy with up to 90% sparsity and demonstrates a speedup of up to 5.67\u00d7 over dense baseline models at 32k context size with 90% sparsity. This method is highly adaptable to various context lengths and sparsity ratios without requiring careful calibration.\n\n### CASAK-V\nCASAK-V uses a meta-learning framework to fine-tune a compact pre-trained transformer for sparse pattern identification. It implements dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, reducing memory usage by 40% and exhibiting sub-linear scaling in inference time. CASAK-V maintains consistent performance up to 128k tokens and shows significant improvements in efficiency metrics such as peak memory usage and inference time.\n\n## Benchmarking Methodologies and Results for Efficient Transformer Variants\n\n### Performance Metrics\n- **CASAK-V**: Evaluated on the RULER benchmark, CASAK-V shows near-linear scaling in memory usage and sub-linear scaling in inference time, significantly outperforming full attention models for long sequences. It maintains consistent performance up to 128k tokens with only slight degradation for extremely long contexts.\n- **SeerAttention**: Benchmarked on the PG19 dataset, SeerAttention outperforms MoA and Minference in terms of perplexity, even with higher sparsity ratios. It demonstrates the ability to learn diverse sparse patterns and achieves significant speedups over dense baseline models.\n- **Selective Attention**: Transformers with selective attention are benchmarked on the C4 dataset and show consistent improvements in validation perplexity and downstream task accuracy (e.g., HellaSwag). They achieve the same performance as standard transformers with twice the number of heads and parameters while reducing memory requirements.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Multiple Optimization Techniques\n\n### Combining Sparse Attention and Cache Compression\n- CASAK-V integrates dynamic sparse attention with adaptive KV-cache compression, which significantly reduces computational complexity and memory usage. This combination allows for efficient handling of long contexts without substantial performance degradation.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\n- Implementations like FlashAttention-2 and LightSeq emphasize the importance of hardware-aware optimizations. These include work partitioning, cache utilization, and GPU-specific optimizations to achieve better performance and efficiency. Integrating such optimizations with adaptive sparse attention mechanisms can further enhance the overall performance of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n### Layerwise Optimization\n- Approaches like Adaptive Large Language Models By Layerwise Attention Shortcuts suggest optimizing attention mechanisms at each layer. This can be combined with adaptive sparse attention to achieve better performance and efficiency. For example, layerwise attention shortcuts can reduce the computational overhead while maintaining accuracy.\n\n## Real-World Performance Comparisons Between Different Transformer Architectures\n\n### Comparative Studies\n- SeerAttention is compared with MoA and Minference, showing superior performance in terms of perplexity and efficiency. CASAK-V is compared with full attention models, demonstrating better scaling behavior and efficiency metrics. Selective Attention is compared with standard transformers, highlighting its ability to achieve equivalent performance with reduced parameters and memory.\n\n### Practical Considerations\n- The integration of multiple optimization techniques, such as dynamic sparse attention, adaptive cache compression, and hardware-aware implementations, is crucial for real-world performance. These approaches need to be balanced to ensure minimal calibration and stable training, as seen in the implementation details of SeerAttention and CASAK-V.\n\nBy focusing on these adaptive sparse attention mechanisms, efficient transformer variants, and integration strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and high-performing autoregressive language models.\n",

However, as these models scale, they encounter significant challenges related to **computational efficiency**, **memory usage**, and **scalability**. The core of these challenges lies in the self-attention mechanism's quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, which hampers the model's ability to handle long contextual information efficiently. Additionally, existing attention mechanisms often struggle with adapting to varying input complexities and maintaining robust performance across diverse downstream tasks.\n\n**GALA-Trafo** aims to address these challenges by integrating **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**, **kernel-based linear transformer optimizations**, and **adaptive sparse attention** strategies within the **AdaptiveAttention** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU). This fusion is expected to yield an LM block that not only reduces computational overhead and memory footprint but also enhances model expressiveness and adaptability, leading to superior performance on both standard and intricate language tasks.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Gated Linear Attention Enhancements\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers**: Introduced by Yang et al. (2023), GLA integrates gating mechanisms into linear attention to control information flow dynamically. This approach allows the model to focus on relevant tokens while suppressing irrelevant ones, achieving competitive performance with traditional Transformers and significant speedups.\n\n### Kernel-Based Attention Optimizations\n\n- **Linear Transformers and Kernel Feature Maps**: Performers and similar models approximate softmax attention using kernel feature maps, achieving linear time and space complexity. The FAVOR+ approach in Performers ensures accurate approximation of softmax attention while maintaining high performance across various tasks (Katharopoulos et al., 2020).\n\n### Adaptive Sparse Attention Strategies\n\n- **Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC)**: SAC implements adaptive sparse attention by learning to construct attention edges, enabling the model to select the most salient nodes and reduce quadratic complexity regardless of sequence length (Li et al., 2020).\n\n- **Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM)**: PAM creates piecewise polynomial models by partitioning the input space into polyhedrons, allowing adaptive-order interactions within each partition to efficiently capture complex dependencies (Zhu et al., 2023).\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Optimization\n\n- **CacheEfficientRMSNorm**: Enhances standard RMSNorm by implementing block-wise statistics computation and selective state compression, optimizing memory access patterns and improving computational efficiency (Reference 1 in user-provided content).\n\n- **Tiling and Fused Operations**: Techniques like tiling, as used in FlashAttention, break down attention computations into smaller, more manageable chunks, optimizing memory access patterns and enhancing cache utilization (Pagliardini et al., 2023).\n\n### Hybrid and Hierarchical Attention Structures\n\n- **E-Tamba: Efficient Transformer-Mamba Layer Transplantation**: Combines Transformer and Mamba layers to enhance downstream NLP performance and improve long-context retrieval ability through layer transplantation and fine-tuning strategies.\n\n- **Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention**: Introduces a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, achieving linear time and space complexity without significant performance loss (Ma et al., 2021).\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges in Current Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Quadratic Complexity**: Traditional self-attention mechanisms have a computational and memory complexity of \\(O(N^2)\\), where \\(N\\) is the sequence length, making it infeasible for very long sequences.\n\n2. **Limited Adaptability**: Existing attention mechanisms often use fixed patterns or scales, lacking the flexibility to adapt based on input complexity and contextual requirements.\n\n3. **Memory Bandwidth and Efficiency**: High memory usage and suboptimal memory access patterns can lead to inefficiencies, especially in large-scale models.\n\n4. **Trade-offs Between Speed and Performance**: Enhancing computational efficiency often leads to compromises in model expressiveness and performance.\n\n### Core Philosophy Behind GALA-Trafo\n\nThe core idea of **GALA-Trafo** is to **harmonize efficiency with adaptability** by integrating gating mechanisms, kernel-based optimizations, and adaptive sparsity within the **AdaptiveAttention** GAU. This integration aims to:\n\n- **Dynamically Control Information Flow**: Using Gated Linear Attention to modulate the flow of information based on input relevance and complexity.\n\n- **Achieve Linear Complexity**: Leveraging kernel-based linear transformers to reduce computational complexity from \\(O(N^2)\\) to \\(O(N)\\), enabling the handling of longer sequences.\n\n- **Optimize Memory Usage**: Implementing adaptive sparse attention to focus computational resources on the most relevant parts of the input, thereby reducing memory overhead.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nLet\u2019s denote the input sequence as \\(X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D}\\), where \\(B\\) is the batch size, \\(L\\) is the sequence length, and \\(D\\) is the embedding dimension.\n\n1. **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**:\n   \n   The GLA mechanism introduces gating functions \\(g_q\\) and \\(g_k\\) to modulate queries and keys respectively:\n\n   \\[\n   Q = W_q X \\odot g_q(X)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   K = W_k X \\odot g_k(X)\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\(W_q\\) and \\(W_k\\) are projection matrices, and \\(\\odot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n2. **Kernel-Based Linear Attention**:\n   \n   By expressing self-attention as a kernel function, we approximate the softmax attention:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) \\approx \\phi(Q) (\\phi(K)^T V)\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\(\\phi(\\cdot)\\) is a feature map function, enabling linear time complexity.\n\n3. **Adaptive Sparse Attention**:\n\n   Introduce a sparsity mask \\(M \\in \\{0,1\\}^{B \\times L \\times L}\\) that selectively activates relevant connections:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{MASK}(M) \\odot (Q K^T) V\n   \\]\n\n   Where \\(\\text{MASK}(M)\\) zeros out irrelevant connections, reducing computational overhead.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Mitigations\n\n- **Expressiveness vs. Efficiency**: While reducing complexity, there is a risk of losing model expressiveness. This is mitigated by the gating mechanisms that ensure only relevant information flows through the model.\n\n- **Adaptive Mechanism Overhead**: Introducing adaptive components can add computational overhead. Efficient implementation strategies like tiling and fused operations ensure that this overhead remains negligible.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection AdaptiveAttention```\n\n### Integrating GLA, Kernel-Based Linear Transformers, and Adaptive Sparse Attention\n\n#### 1.

This integration addresses the core challenges of computational inefficiency, memory overhead, and scalability inherent in traditional self-attention mechanisms. By dynamically controlling information flow, approximating softmax attention with linear complexity, and selectively focusing on relevant tokens, GALA-Trafo achieves a superior balance between efficiency and performance. The incorporation of **CacheEfficientRMSNorm** further optimizes memory access patterns, ensuring stable and efficient training and inference processes. As a result, GALA-Trafo is poised to enhance the capabilities of large-scale language models, enabling them to handle longer sequences with reduced computational resources while maintaining or even improving performance across various downstream tasks.\n\n## References\n\n- Katharopoulos, A., Vyas, A., Pappas, N., & Fleuret, F.
