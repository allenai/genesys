Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/51 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 4.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency.

Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code. Our code has been released as open source.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 79  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. HyperConformer: Multi-head HyperMixer for Efficient Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention transformer hardware efficient*\n\n*Petr Motlicek, Titouan Parcollet, Juan Zuluaga-Gomez, Florian Mai*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art ASR systems have achieved promising results by modeling local and global interactions separately. While the former can be computed efficiently, global interactions are usually modeled via attention mechanisms, which are expensive for long input sequences. Here, we address this by extending HyperMixer, an efficient alternative to attention exhibiting linear complexity, to the Conformer architecture for speech recognition, leading to HyperConformer. In particular, multi-head HyperConformer achieves comparable or higher recognition performance while being more efficient than Conformer in terms of inference speed, memory, parameter count, and available training data. HyperConformer achieves a word error rate of 2.9% on Librispeech test-clean with less than 8M neural parameters and a peak memory during training of 5.7GB, hence trainable with accessible hardware. Encoder speed is between 38% on mid-length speech and 56% on long speech faster than an equivalent Conformer. (The HyperConformer recipe is publicly available in: https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain/tree/develop/recipes/LibriSpeech/ASR/transformer/)\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on linear attention mechanisms with an emphasis on hardware efficiency, memory optimization, and practical implementation details, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n- GLA introduces a data-dependent gating mechanism that significantly improves the performance of linear attention models. This approach achieves state-of-the-art results in linear-complexity language modeling, often matching or surpassing traditional transformer models, especially on long sequences.\n- GLA enables hardware-efficient implementation by structuring the gating term and leveraging chunk-wise calculations, which enhances inference throughput compared to similar-sized transformer models.\n\n### Performance and Efficiency\n- GLA models demonstrate linear time complexity during inference and a constant memory footprint, making them suitable for tasks like audio modeling, streaming, or on-device applications. They also show better length generalization, allowing models trained on shorter sequences to generalize well to longer sequences without significant perplexity degradation.\n\n## Memory Optimization\n\n### Selective State Management\n- The concept of selective state updates, inspired by state space models, can be integrated with linear attention mechanisms. This involves selective updates based on input relevance and structured state compression using learned basis states, which can significantly improve memory efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Reduced State Size\n- Models like Rodimus, which use linear attention with data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) and sliding window shared-key attention (SW-SKA), maintain a much smaller hidden state size compared to other state-of-the-art recurrent models while outperforming them in some tasks.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Training\n- The FLASHLINEARATTENTION algorithm, as described in the Lina-Speech work, trades off memory movement against parallelizability, making linear attention more efficient for training on modern hardware. This approach is faster than optimized softmax attention implementations on short sequence lengths and competitive on longer sequences.\n\n### Chunk-Wise Computation\n- Techniques such as chunk-wise computation and prefix-sum algorithms are used to enhance the hardware efficiency of linear-scaling language models. These methods improve the parallelizability and reduce the computational overhead of linear attention.\n\n### Gated Slot Attention (GSA)\n- GSA enhances linear attention by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by GLA, using context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting. This design improves both training and inference efficiency while maintaining compact recurrent state size.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Quantization and Efficient Inference\n- For further optimization, quantization techniques like the QoQ algorithm (4-bit weight, 8-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) can be applied to reduce the memory footprint and improve inference throughput on GPUs. This approach also mitigates the accuracy degradation incurred by low-precision quantization.\n\nBy combining these techniques\u2014such as using GLA, selective state management, and efficient quantization methods\u2014researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly efficient in terms of hardware usage, memory optimization, and practical implementation, while maintaining strong expressiveness and performance.\n",

Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 5. GQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*J. Ainslie, J. Lee-Thorp, Michiel de Jong, Yury Zemlyanskiy, Federico Lebr'on, Sumit K. Sanghai*\n\n**Published in:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (2023)\t**Cited by** 208  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and introduces grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi- query attention which uses an intermediate number of query heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-query attention (MQA), which only uses a single key-value head, drastically speeds up decoder inference. However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/14 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nGeoffrey E.

History Compression via Language Models in Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Fabian Paischer, Thomas Adler, Vihang Patil, Angela Bitto-Nemling, Markus Holzleitner, S. Lehner, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency, and introduces FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** In a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), an agent typically uses a representation of the past to approximate the underlying MDP. We propose to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer, we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results.

Winning the Lottery Ahead of Time: Efficient Early Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*John Rachwan, Daniel Zugner, Bertrand Charpentier, Simon Geisler, Morgane Ayle, Stephan Gunnemann*\n\n**TL;DR:** Early Compression via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP) is proposed, which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge, and can be applied in a structured manner addressing challenge.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning, the task of sparsifying deep neural networks, received increasing attention recently. Although state-of-the-art pruning methods extract highly sparse models, they neglect two main challenges: (1) the process of finding these sparse models is often very expensive; (2) unstructured pruning does not provide benefits in terms of GPU memory, training time, or carbon emissions. We propose Early Compression via Gradient Flow Preservation (EarlyCroP), which efficiently extracts state-of-the-art sparse models before or early in training addressing challenge (1), and can be applied in a structured manner addressing challenge (2). This enables us to train sparse networks on commodity GPUs whose dense versions would be too large, thereby saving costs and reducing hardware requirements. We empirically show that EarlyCroP outperforms a rich set of baselines for many tasks (incl. classification, regression) and domains (incl. computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcment learning). EarlyCroP leads to accuracy comparable to dense training while outperforming pruning baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. QuIP#: Even Better LLM Quantization with Hadamard Incoherence and Lattice Codebooks\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Albert Tseng, Jerry Chee, Qingyao Sun, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Christopher De Sa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes using three novel techniques, and introduces a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing.\n\n**Abstract:** Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint of LLMs by quantizing their weights to low-precision. In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves QuIP's (Chee et al., 2023) incoherence processing by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector quantization to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses fine-tuning to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

Learning with Auxiliary Activation for Memory-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Sunghyeon Woo, Dongsuk Jeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation, and combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation.\n\n**Abstract:** While deep learning has achieved great success in various fields, a large amount of memory is necessary to train deep neural networks, which hinders the development of massive state-of-the-art models. The reason is the conventional learning rule, backpropagation, should temporarily store input activations of all the layers in the network. To overcome this, recent studies suggested various memory-efficient implementations of backpropagation. However, those approaches incur computational overhead due to the recomputation of activations, slowing down neural network training. In this work, we propose a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation. The algorithm combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation instead of actual input activation to reduce the amount of data to be temporarily stored. We mathematically show that our learning rule can reliably train the networks if the auxiliary activation satisfies certain conditions. Based on this observation, we suggest candidates of auxiliary activation that satisfy those conditions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed learning rule achieves competitive performance compared to backpropagation in various models such as ResNet, Transformer, BERT, ViT, and MLP-Mixer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. DIVISION: Memory Efficient Training via Dual Activation Precision\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Guanchu Wang, Zirui Liu, Zhimeng Jiang, Ninghao Liu, Nannan Zou, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision during the training, which can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation.\n\n**Abstract:** Activation compressed training provides a solution towards reducing the memory cost of training deep neural networks~(DNNs). However, state-of-the-art work combines a search of quantization bit-width with the training, which makes the procedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a simple and effective method to compress DNN training. Our method is motivated by an instructive observation: DNN backward propagation mainly utilizes the low-frequency component (LFC) of the activation maps, while the majority of memory is for caching the high-frequency component (HFC) during the training. This indicates the HFC of activation maps is highly redundant and compressible during DNN training, which inspires our proposed Dual Activation Precision (DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision. This can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation such that DIVISION maintains competitive model accuracy. Experiment results show DIVISION has better comprehensive performance than state-of-the-art methods, including over 10x compression of activation maps and competitive training throughput, without loss of model accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Sheng Shen, Xiuyu Li, Zhen Dong, Amir Gholami, Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Olga Russakovsky, Zhiwei Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state compression memory efficient training*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on state compression techniques and memory-efficient training methods, here are some key findings and approaches from the provided sources:\n\n## State Compression Techniques\n\n### Activation Checkpointing\nActivation checkpointing is a technique that reduces memory usage by recalculating intermediate states during the backward pass instead of storing them. This method trades runtime for memory savings, which is crucial for large models. For example, in the context of protein language models, activation checkpointing lowered GPU memory usage significantly.\n\n### Context Compression\nContext compression methods, such as those used in sequence models, can enhance efficiency by focusing on the most relevant information. This approach can speed up processing and reduce memory footprint. Techniques like selective copying and induction heads help models remember or ignore input based on its content, which is essential for maintaining model expressiveness while reducing memory usage.\n\n### Low-Rank Decomposition\nLow-rank decomposition methods break down matrices or tensors into smaller components, reducing the number of parameters while maintaining performance. Techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are commonly used for this purpose.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Training Methods\n\n### Quantization\nQuantization reduces the precision of model parameters without altering the number of parameters, significantly decreasing the memory footprint and accelerating inference times. For instance, converting 32-bit floating-point weights to 8-bit integers can lead to substantial improvements in speed and efficiency. Methods like Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and SpinQuant are effective in optimizing performance in low-precision environments.\n\n### Compressing Optimizer States and Activations\nThe COAT framework compresses optimizer states and activations for FP8 training, which reduces the memory footprint while maintaining performance. This involves dynamic range expansion and mixed-granularity activation quantization, leading to a significant reduction in memory usage without compromising accuracy.\n\n### Partition-Attention and Batch Size Optimization\nTechniques like Partition-Attention enable transformer models to handle proteins with highly diverse lengths efficiently, extending batch sizes and ensuring consistent computational cost. This is critical for scaling computations across multiple GPUs and managing memory effectively.\n\n### ZeroOffload/CPUAdam\nOffloading optimization states to CPU memory and performing parameter updates on the CPU can save significant GPU memory. This strategy is particularly useful when training large models, as it reduces the memory burden on GPUs.\n\n## Implementation Strategies\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\nImplementations like tiling and block-based processing are crucial for practical efficiency in linear attention. Gating mechanisms can improve expressiveness while maintaining efficiency. These approaches help in managing long sequences effectively and optimizing memory access patterns[Analysis Note].\n\n### IO-Aware Implementations\nIO-aware implementations are essential for real-world performance gains. Techniques that manage intra-block and inter-block computations efficiently, such as those described in \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"CHELA,\" are vital for bridging theoretical and practical efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these state compression techniques and memory-efficient training methods, researchers can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models, ensuring they maintain expressiveness while reducing memory footprint and enhancing overall efficiency.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

In particular, it is the heart of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (Devlin et al., 2019), and found wide-spread adoption across several research areas since then. Given a query $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and lists of keys and values $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ of length $n$, attention is defined as follows:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{e^{s_{i}}}{\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThe result of the attention operation for a single query, is hence a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are the softmax of the dot products of the query and the keys. The straight-forward implementation of the attention operation above requires us to first compute and remember $s_{i}$ for all $i$, leading to a $O(n)$ time and memory complexity for each query. Transformers use self-attention, which issues a separate query for each position in the sequence, so the overall time and space complexity is $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. In many works the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention has been used as the motivation for the investigation of variants of the original attention mechanism and architectures with more favorable complexity classes (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Child et al., 2019; Tay et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020). In this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and logarithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3). We also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory for self-attention (see Section 4 ). Unlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for attention that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient\nalgorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to reconsider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ time complexity for self-attention and $O(n)$ time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention. ## 2 Algorithm\n\nFirst, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with a single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by $\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}$ can be moved to the very end of the attention operation using the distributive law:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=e^{s_{i}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\frac{\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}}{\\sum_{j} s_{j}^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nAfter publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the \"lazy softmax\" method of Jang et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.75)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

SPACE: Single-round Participant Amalgamation for Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yi-Chung Chen, Hsi-Wen Chen, Shun-Gui Wang, Ming-Syan Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results demonstrate that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both running time and Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient.\n\n**Abstract:** The evaluation of participant contribution in federated learning (FL) has recently gained significant attention due to its applicability in various domains, such as incentive mechanisms, robustness enhancement, and client selection. Previous approaches have predominantly relied on the widely adopted Shapley value for participant evaluation. However, the computation of the Shapley value is expensive, despite using techniques like gradient-based model reconstruction and truncating unnecessary evaluations. Therefore, we present an efficient approach called Single-round Participants Amalgamation for Contribution Evaluation (SPACE). SPACE incorporates two novel components, namely Federated Knowledge Amalgamation and Prototype-based Model Evaluation to reduce the evaluation effort by eliminating the dependence on the size of the validation set and enabling participant evaluation within a single communication round. Experimental results demonstrate that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both running time and Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on applications, client reweighting, and client selection highlight the effectiveness of SPACE.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. TokenMixup: Efficient Attention-guided Token-level Data Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Hyeong Kyu Choi, Joonmyung Choi, Hyunwoo J. Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** TokenMixup is proposed, an efficient attention-guided token-level data augmentation method that aims to maximize the saliency of a mixed set of tokens and provides x15 faster saliency-awareData augmentation compared to gradient-based methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixup is a commonly adopted data augmentation technique for image classification. Recent advances in mixup methods primarily focus on mixing based on saliency. However, many saliency detectors require intense computation and are especially burdensome for parameter-heavy transformer models. To this end, we propose TokenMixup, an efficient attention-guided token-level data augmentation method that aims to maximize the saliency of a mixed set of tokens. TokenMixup provides x15 faster saliency-aware data augmentation compared to gradient-based methods. Moreover, we introduce a variant of TokenMixup which mixes tokens within a single instance, thereby enabling multi-scale feature augmentation. Experiments show that our methods significantly improve the baseline models' performance on CIFAR and ImageNet-1K, while being more efficient than previous methods. We also reach state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 among from-scratch transformer models.

Communication-Efficient Federated Hypergradient Computation via Aggregated Iterative Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD), which achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated bilevel optimization has attracted increasing attention due to emerging machine learning and communication applications. The biggest challenge lies in computing the gradient of the upper-level objective function (i.e., hypergradient) in the federated setting due to the nonlinear and distributed construction of a series of global Hessian matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD). AggITD is simple to implement and significantly reduces the communication cost by conducting the federated hypergradient estimation and the lower-level optimization simultaneously. We show that the proposed AggITD-based algorithm achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity. Our results also shed light on the great advantage of ITD over AID in the federated/distributed hypergradient estimation. This differs from the comparison in the non-distributed bilevel optimization, where ITD is less efficient than AID.

In recent years several SR deep learning approaches with outstanding achievement have been introduced by sacrificing memory and computational cost. To overcome this problem, a novel lightweight super resolution network is proposed, which improves the SOTA performance in lightweight SR and performs roughly similar to computationally expensive networks. Multi-Path Residual Network designs with a set of Residual concatenation Blocks stacked with Adaptive Residual Blocks: ($i$) to adaptively extract informative features and learn more expressive spatial context information; ($ii$) to better leverage multi-level representations before up-sampling stage; and ($iii$) to allow an efficient information and gradient flow within the network. The proposed architecture also contains a new attention mechanism, Two-Fold Attention Module, to maximize the representation ability of the model.

Improving the Transferability of Adversarial Examples with Restructure Embedded Patches\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yuanzhang Li, Shangbo Wu, Haoran Lyu, Yajie Wang, Yu-an Tan, Huipeng Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision tasks. However, the adversarial examples generated by ViTs are challenging to transfer to other networks with different structures. Recent attack methods do not consider the specificity of ViTs architecture and self-attention mechanism, which leads to poor transferability of the generated adversarial samples by ViTs. We attack the unique self-attention mechanism in ViTs by restructuring the embedded patches of the input. The restructured embedded patches enable the self-attention mechanism to obtain more diverse patches connections and help ViTs keep regions of interest on the object. Therefore, we propose an attack method against the unique self-attention mechanism in ViTs, called Self-Attention Patches Restructure (SAPR). Our method is simple to implement yet efficient and applicable to any self-attention based network and gradient transferability-based attack methods. We evaluate attack transferability on black-box models with different structures. The result show that our method generates adversarial examples on white-box ViTs with higher transferability and higher image quality. Our research advances the development of black-box transfer attacks on ViTs and demonstrates the feasibility of using white-box ViTs to attack other black-box models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. Softmax-free Linear Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation efficient attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tao Xiang, Junge Zhang, Jianfeng Feng, Jiachen Lu, Xiatian Zhu, Li Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have pushed the state-of-the-art for visual perception tasks. The self-attention mechanism underpinning the strength of ViTs has a quadratic complexity in both computation and memory usage. This motivates the development of approximating the self-attention at linear complexity. However, an in-depth analysis in this work reveals that existing methods are either theoretically flawed or empirically ineffective for visual recognition. We identify that their limitations are rooted in the inheritance of softmax-based self-attention during approximations, that is, normalizing the scaled dot-product between token feature vectors using the softmax function. As preserving the softmax operation challenges any subsequent linearization efforts. By this insight, a family of Softmax-Free Transformers (SOFT) are proposed. Specifically, a Gaussian kernel function is adopted to replace the dot-product similarity, enabling a full self-attention matrix to be approximated under low-rank matrix decomposition. For computational robustness, we estimate the Moore-Penrose inverse using an iterative Newton-Raphson method in the forward process only, while calculating its theoretical gradients only once in the backward process. To further expand applicability (e.g., dense prediction tasks), an efficient symmetric normalization technique is introduced. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, COCO, and ADE20K show that our SOFT significantly improves the computational efficiency of existing ViT variants. With linear complexity, much longer token sequences are permitted by SOFT, resulting in superior trade-off between accuracy and complexity.

For example, the \"Reformer\" model uses reversible residual layers, which allow storing activations only once instead of multiple times, making the training process more memory-efficient.\n- \"Learning with Auxiliary Activation\" combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation and uses only the auxiliary activation during backward propagation, reducing the amount of data to be temporarily stored.\n\n### Selective State Updates\n- Methods like \"Samba\" selectively compress a given sequence into recurrent hidden states, maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. This approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or Simple State Machines (SSMs).\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention\n- The \"Reformer\" model introduces a new attention mechanism called \"Reversible Attention\" which, combined with reversible residual layers, reduces the memory requirements for storing activations during training.\n- \"Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\" proposes a method to prune the context in autoregressive transformers dynamically, reducing memory usage and maintaining performance.\n\n### Dual Precision and Frequency-Based Compression\n- \"DIVISION\" uses a dual precision approach, preserving the high-precision copy of the low-frequency component (LFC) of activation maps and compressing the high-frequency component (HFC) into a lightweight copy. This approach is particularly useful for memory-efficient backward propagation.\n\n## Advanced Gradient Computation and Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Block-Wise Processing and Cache Efficiency\n- Implementing block-wise processing with tiling can enhance cache efficiency and reduce memory bandwidth requirements. This approach is aligned with the \"Reformer\" model's use of reversible layers and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementation Strategies\n- Hardware-aware implementation strategies, such as optimizing memory access patterns and using IO-aware computation patterns, can further enhance the efficiency of gradient computation and attention mechanisms. These strategies ensure that the model is optimized for the specific hardware it is running on, reducing memory bandwidth requirements and improving overall performance.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n### Advanced Gradient Smoothing and Noise Reduction\n- While not directly focused on attention mechanisms, techniques like \"AdaptGrad\" for gradient smoothing can improve the interpretability and robustness of models. These methods could be integrated into autoregressive language models to enhance their overall performance and stability.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory usage, gradient computation, and attention mechanisms, while maintaining or improving model performance.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.92)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 2 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: cache optimization memory bandwidth reduction\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

CYCLADES is asynchronous during shared model updates, and requires no memory locking mechanisms, similar to HOGWILD!-type algorithms. Unlike HOGWILD!, CYCLADES introduces no conflicts during the parallel execution, and offers a black-box analysis for provable speedups across a large family of algorithms. Due to its inherent conflict-free nature and cache locality, our multi-core implementation of CYCLADES consistently outperforms HOGWILD!-type algorithms on sufficiently sparse datasets, leading to up to 40% speedup gains compared to the HOGWILD! implementation of SGD, and up to 5x gains over asynchronous implementations of variance reduction algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Minimal Random Code Learning: Getting Bits Back from Compressed Model Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization memory bandwidth reduction*\n\n*Marton Havasi, Robert Peharz, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: on the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, the approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for aFixed test performance.\n\n**Abstract:** While deep neural networks are a highly successful model class, their large memory footprint puts considerable strain on energy consumption, communication bandwidth, and storage requirements. Consequently, model size reduction has become an utmost goal in deep learning. A typical approach is to train a set of deterministic weights, while applying certain techniques such as pruning and quantization, in order that the empirical weight distribution becomes amenable to Shannon-style coding schemes. However, as shown in this paper, relaxing weight determinism and using a full variational distribution over weights allows for more efficient coding schemes and consequently higher compression rates. In particular, following the classical bits-back argument, we encode the network weights using a random sample, requiring only a number of bits corresponding to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the sampled variational distribution and the encoding distribution. By imposing a constraint on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we are able to explicitly control the compression rate, while optimizing the expected loss on the training set. The employed encoding scheme can be shown to be close to the optimal information-theoretical lower bound, with respect to the employed variational family. Our method sets new state-of-the-art in neural network compression, as it strictly dominates previous approaches in a Pareto sense: On the benchmarks LeNet-5/MNIST and VGG-16/CIFAR-10, our approach yields the best test performance for a fixed memory budget, and vice versa, it achieves the highest compression rates for a fixed test performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on cache optimization and memory bandwidth reduction, here are some key techniques and strategies from the provided sources:\n\n## Cache Optimization\n\n### KV Cache Quantization and Sparsity\n- The `torchao` library implements KV cache quantization, which significantly reduces VRAM usage for transformer-based models. This involves quantizing the key and value matrices to lower precision formats, such as int4 or int8, to reduce memory footprint.\n- The BUZZ algorithm uses a beehive-structured sparse KV cache, which selectively stores and evicts key-value pairs to maintain contextual understanding while minimizing cache memory usage. This approach employs a sliding window and dynamic segmentation of historical tokens to prioritize important tokens.\n\n### Selective Sharding and Attention Head Sparsity\n- Techniques like FastGen and Sparse Sharding Attention (SSA) reduce memory constraints by selectively calculating attention values for relevant input tokens. FastGen calculates accurate attention values by choosing only selected, attention-head relevant input tokens, resulting in a 40% reduction in memory for Llama models without losing accuracy.\n- SSA generalizes this approach by splitting input in a fixed pattern across attention heads, each operating on a subset of input elements, which reduces compute and memory while maintaining accuracy.\n\n## Memory Bandwidth Reduction\n\n### Efficient Execution Plans and Memory Access\n- Optimizing the execution plan to avoid unnecessary overhead is crucial. Techniques such as dynamic memory allocation (e.g., PagedAttention) and efficient memory allocators (e.g., multi-threaded arena allocators) can alleviate memory constraints and reduce memory transfers between accelerator and host memory.\n- Hardware-aware memory access patterns are essential. For example, kernel fusion combines multiple operations into a single kernel execution, reducing the overhead associated with launching multiple kernels and improving data locality and cache utilization.\n\n### Quantization and Compression\n- Quantization methods, such as those implemented in `torchao`, reduce the memory footprint by representing tensors with fewer bits. This includes weight-only quantization, dynamic activation quantization, and automatic quantization strategies.\n- Compression techniques can further reduce memory bandwidth. Adaptive KV cache compression is a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for large language models by compressing the KV cache.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details\n\n### Tiling and Block-wise Processing\n- Tiling strategies, as mentioned in \"Lightning Attention-2,\" involve handling intra-block and inter-block components separately in linear attention calculations. This approach enhances cache efficiency and reduces memory bandwidth requirements[Analysis Note].\n- Block-wise processing is also highlighted as a method to improve cache utilization and reduce memory overhead[Analysis Note].\n\n### IO-Aware Computation and Cache-Friendly Access\n- IO-aware computation patterns are crucial for performance. For instance, matrix decomposition techniques that compute FFT using matrix multiply units and enable kernel fusion for long sequences can reduce I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy[Analysis Note: \"FlashFFTConv\"].\n- Cache-friendly memory access patterns are necessary to minimize memory transfers and optimize performance. This includes optimizing the computational graph to reduce peak memory usage and avoid unnecessary overhead.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014such as KV cache quantization, selective sharding, efficient execution plans, quantization, compression, tiling, and IO-aware computation\u2014the researchers can significantly improve the cache optimization and memory bandwidth reduction for their autoregressive language models, leading to better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/74 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nVol. 34. 2020.

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n#### 2. The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective  (Avg.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/63 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nE. Hinton.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

Graph Reordering for Cache-Efficient Near Neighbor Search\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Normalization*\n\n*Benjamin Coleman, Santiago Segarra, Anshumali Shrivastava, A. Smola*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents exhaustive experiments applying several reordering algorithms to a leading graph-based near neighbor method based on the HNSW index, and finds that reordering improves the query time by up to 40%, and demonstrates that the time needed to reorder the graph is negligible compared to the time required to construct the index.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph search is one of the most successful algorithmic trends in near neighbor search. Several of the most popular and empirically successful algorithms are, at their core, a simple walk along a pruned near neighbor graph. Such algorithms consistently perform at the top of industrial speed benchmarks for applications such as embedding search. However, graph traversal applications often suffer from poor memory access patterns, and near neighbor search is no exception to this rule. Our measurements show that popular search indices such as the hierarchical navigable small-world graph (HNSW) can have poor cache miss performance. To address this problem, we apply graph reordering algorithms to near neighbor graphs. Graph reordering is a memory layout optimization that groups commonly-accessed nodes together in memory. We present exhaustive experiments applying several reordering algorithms to a leading graph-based near neighbor method based on the HNSW index. We find that reordering improves the query time by up to 40%, and we demonstrate that the time needed to reorder the graph is negligible compared to the time required to construct the index.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Normalization*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

In this work, we propose a novel framework, BADGE, which consists of two off-the-shelf methods for improving PLMs\u2019 early exiting. We first address the issues of training a multi-exit PLM, the backbone model for early exiting.

Optimal Block-wise Asymmetric Graph Construction for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Block-wise Normalization*\n\n*Zixing Song, Yifei Zhang, Irwin King*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper designs an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee that distinguishes the distinct roles that labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes could play and performs extensive experiments to demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art graph construction methods in GSSL.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) serves as a powerful tool to model the underlying manifold structures of samples in high-dimensional spaces. It involves two phases: constructing an affinity graph from available data and inferring labels for unlabeled nodes on this graph. While numerous algorithms have been developed for label inference, the crucial graph construction phase has received comparatively less attention, despite its significant influence on the subsequent phase. In this paper, we present an optimal asymmetric graph structure for the label inference phase with theoretical motivations. Unlike existing graph construction methods, we differentiate the distinct roles that labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes could play. Accordingly, we design an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee. Other benefits induced by our method, such as enhanced robustness to noisy node features, are explored as well. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art graph construction methods in GSSL.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware RMSNorm*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware RMSNorm*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

HW-NAS-Bench: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware RMSNorm*\n\n*Chaojian Li, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Qixuan Yu, Yue Wang, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HW-NAS-Bench is developed, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW- NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NA research more reproducible and accessible and verify that dedicated device-specific HW- Nas can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.\n\n**Abstract:** HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Normalization*\n\n*Michael Spranger, Jiayu Zhou, Lingjuan Lyu, Junyuan Hong*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memoryconstrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling\r\nshows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for backpropagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain\r\nstable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-theart CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

An All-MLP Sequence Modeling Architecture That Excels at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Normalization*\n\n*Hannah Kerner, Gedeon Muhawenayo, Zehao Yan, Chenwei Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work demonstrated Transformers' ability to efficiently copy strings of exponential sizes, distinguishing them from other architectures. We present the Causal Relation Network (CausalRN), an all-MLP sequence modeling architecture that can match Transformers on the copying task. Extending Relation Networks (RNs), we implemented key innovations to support autoregressive sequence modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. We discovered that exponentially-activated RNs are reducible to linear time complexity, and pre-activation normalization induces an infinitely growing memory pool, similar to a KV cache. In ablation study, we found both exponential activation and pre-activation normalization are indispensable for Transformer-level copying. Our findings provide new insights into what actually constitutes strong in-context retrieval.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. MaskNet: Introducing Feature-Wise Multiplication to CTR Ranking Models by Instance-Guided Mask\n\n*From Search Query: Block-wise Normalization*\n\n*Junlin Zhang, Qingyun She, Zhiqiang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Click-Through Rate(CTR) estimation has become one of the most fundamental tasks in many real-world applications and it's important for ranking models to effectively capture complex high-order features. Shallow feed-forward network is widely used in many state-of-the-art DNN models such as FNN, DeepFM and xDeepFM to implicitly capture high-order feature interactions. However, some research has proved that addictive feature interaction, particular feed-forward neural networks, is inefficient in capturing common feature interaction. To resolve this problem, we introduce specific multiplicative operation into DNN ranking system by proposing instance-guided mask which performs element-wise product both on the feature embedding and feed-forward layers guided by input instance. We also turn the feed-forward layer in DNN model into a mixture of addictive and multiplicative feature interactions by proposing MaskBlock in this paper. MaskBlock combines the layer normalization, instance-guided mask, and feed-forward layer and it is a basic building block to be used to design new ranking model under various configurations. The model consisting of MaskBlock is called MaskNet in this paper and two new MaskNet models are proposed to show the effectiveness of MaskBlock as basic building block for composing high performance ranking systems. The experiment results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MaskNet models outperform state-of-the-art models such as DeepFM and xDeepFM significantly, which implies MaskBlock is an effective basic building unit for composing new high performance ranking systems.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Block-wise Normalization*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Jitendra Malik, Karttikeya Mangalam, Nicholas Lee, Albert Shaw, Amir Gholami, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs.

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1. Efficient Architecture for Transformers\n\nWith the advent of the pioneering Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), the potential of the transformer architecture for computer vision tasks has been greatly explored. Various researchers are devoted to this field to make transformer-based architecture more efficient and powerful. Touvron et al. (2021) propose DeiT which utilizes distillation to achieve strong performance with training only on ImageNet1K. Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2021) propose Swin Transformer, which introduces shifted windowing scheme and brings greater efficiency. As the self-attention computation is limited to a small window, this transformer has linear computational complexity. Several works improve the design of sparse pattern to enhance the interaction of each token, such as CSwin (Dong et al., 2022). Besides, the dynamic attention mechanism tries to control the key/value interact with query adaptive to data, such as DAT++ (Xia et al., 2023) and BiFormer (Zhu et al., 2023). Apart from the above methods, linear attention is a popular research direction to reduce the computational complexity for transformer. Many effective mechanisms have been proposed to replace the softmax function. For example, Performers (Choromanski et al., 2020) uses positive orthogonal random features approach to approximate softmax. Hydra attention (Bolya et al., 2022) selects the cosine similarity as kernel function. Flatten Transformer (Han et al., 2023) designs a focused function to improve the focus ability of linear attention. ### 2.2. Normalization for Transformers\n\nNormalization is known as an useful method to make training stable and boost performance. Nowadays, a variety of normalization methods have been proposed, such as BatchNorm (Ioffe \\& Szegedy, 2015), LayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016), InstanceNorm (Ulyanov et al., 2016), GroupNorm (Wu \\& He, 2018), MABN (Yan et al., 2020) and UN (Yang et al., 2022). BatchNorm is widely used in convolutional networks and LayerNorm is commonly utilized for networks such as transformer and LSTM. Normalization could be categorized into offline methods and online methods according to whether the mean and variance need to be computed at inference time (Yang et al., 2022). Online methods are usually batch-irrelevant like LayerNorm, InstanceNorm and GroupNorm. These methods compute the statistics in both training and inference. LayerNorm is a commonly used in transformer architecture. Offline methods are batch-related like BatchNorm and UN, in which the batch dimension is concluded in the calculations of both mean and variance (Yao et al., 2021). As the mean and variance are pre-computed in inference, offline\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-03.jpg?height=616&width=1676&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=192)\n\nFigure 2. The overall framework of our proposed Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm. (a) During training, we progressively replace LayerNorm with RepBN, which is a new re-parameterization formula of BatchNorm to further improve the performance. (b) We could get $\\gamma=0$ during inference, thus the transformer block transits to a RepBN-based architecture, which could further be re-parameterized to BatchNorm and merged with linear layers. normalization can be fused into adjacent linear operations. During inference, there will be no offline normalization operations and the inference time will be reduced. However, offline methods usually face the problem of performance degradation and training collapse while using in transformer. To address this problem, Yao et al. (2021) proposes to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the MLP block that makes training statistics stable. Yang et al. (2022) finds that the issue is caused by abnormal behaviors of activation statistics, and proposes a tailored fluctuation smoothing strategy and an adaptive outlier filtration strategy to boost performance and stable training. ## 3. Preliminaries\n\nGiven the input $N$ tokens $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C}$, where $C$ is the feature dimension, the general architecture of transformer block can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X=X+\\operatorname{Attn}(\\operatorname{Norm}(X)) \\\\\n& X=X+\\operatorname{MLP}(\\operatorname{Norm}(X))\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\cdot)$ calculates the attention scores, $\\operatorname{MLP}(\\cdot)$ denotes multilayer perceptron and $\\operatorname{Norm}(\\cdot)$ is the normalization function. In the default configuration of transformer block, Norm $(\\cdot)$ is usually a LayerNorm operation and $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\cdot)$ is the softmax-based attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017). Attention plays an important role in Transformer. Denote query, key and value matrix as $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times C}$, softmax attention computes the pairwise similarity between queries and keys firstly, and leads to the quadratic computation complexity $O\\left(N^{2} C\\right)$ in relation to the number of queries and keys N. This makes transformer computationally expensive especially in dealing with tasks that have a long sequence in- put. Linear attention aims to decouple the softmax function with proper approximation or instead it with other kernel function to compute $K^{T} V$ first. With this change in computation order, the computation complexity becomes $O\\left(N C^{2}\\right)$, which is linearly related to the number of queries and keys N. However, LayerNorm occupies unnegligible portion of latency since it requires statistic calculation during inference. Therefore, in this paper we explore to leverage BatchNorm for building efficient transformers, which only exists in training and could be merged with preceding or sequential linear layers. Moreover, the attention module plays the most important part for transformers and the softmax-based attention mechanism is computational inefficient due to its quadratic computation complexity. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient form of attention, which greatly reduce the latency but also remains strong performance on various vision tasks. ## 4. Methods\n\nIn this paper, we focus on building efficient transformers and propose a series of strategies, including a progressive strategy to replace the LayerNorm ( LN ) with the reparameterized BatchNorm (BN) and the simplified linear attention (SLA) module. The proposed SLAB transformers obtains strong performance compared with prior methods while enjoying more computational efficacy. ### 4.1. Progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm\n\nLayerNorm requires statistic calculations in both training and inference, thus significantly hinders the running speed of transformers. On contrast, BatchNorm could be sim-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-04.jpg?height=604&width=1716&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=179)\n\nFigure 3. Attention map $(196 \\times 196)$ from the 4 rd block of the model based on DeiT-T. (a) Attention map of DeiT-T is full-rank.

(c) As simplified linear attention and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm are applied in transformer, the model still keeps a high rank. ply merged with linear layers during inference and is more suitable for efficient architectures. However, directly leveraging BatchNorm for transformers brings unsatisfactory performance (Yao et al., 2021). To this end, we propose to progressively replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm during training, and also propose a new re-parameterization formula of BatchNorm inspired by Ding et al. $(2021$; 2022) to further improve the performance, as shown in Figure 2. Re-parameterized BatchNorm. The proposed RepBN is formulated as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{RepBN}(X)=\\mathrm{BN}(X)+\\eta X\n$$\n\nwhere $\\eta$ is a learnable parameter that is jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Once the training is done, the RepBN could be re-parameterized as a norm form of BN, as shown in Lemma 4.1. Lemma 4.1. Denote a BN layer with mean $\\mu$, standard deviation $\\sigma$, rescale and shift parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ as $\\operatorname{BN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, \\beta)$. We can re-parameterize the RepBN in Eq. 2 as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{RepBN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, \\beta)=\\operatorname{BN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha+\\eta \\sigma, \\beta+\\eta \\mu)\n$$\n\n## Proof. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{RepBN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, \\beta)=\\mathrm{BN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha, \\beta)+\\eta X \\\\\n& =\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\alpha+\\beta+\\eta X=\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\alpha+\\beta+\\frac{X}{\\sigma} \\sigma \\eta \\\\\n& =\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\alpha+\\beta+\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\sigma \\eta+\\mu \\eta \\\\\n& =\\frac{X-\\mu}{\\sigma}(\\alpha+\\eta \\sigma)+(\\beta+\\eta \\mu) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{BN}(X ; \\mu, \\sigma, \\alpha+\\eta \\sigma, \\beta+\\eta \\mu)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nBased on Lemma 4.1, the distribution of RepBN's output is control by $\\alpha+\\eta \\sigma$ and $\\beta+\\eta \\mu$, which is corresponds to the variance and mean. RepBN can recover the distribution with the help of $\\sigma$ and $\\mu$. Meanwhile, when $\\alpha=0, \\beta=0$, it is equivalent to BatchNorm being skipped. When $\\eta=0$, RepBN is converted into pure BatchNorm. Progressive LN $\\rightarrow$ RepBN. To facilitate the training of a pure BN-based transformers, we propose to progressively transit the LN to RepBN during training, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{PRepBN}(X)=\\gamma \\operatorname{LN}(X)+(1-\\gamma) \\operatorname{RepBN}(X)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\gamma$ is a hyper-parameter to control the output of different normalization layers. Generally $\\gamma=1$ at the begin of training when the LN dominates the architecture, and $\\gamma=0$ at the end of training to make sure it transits to a pure BN -based transformer. We utilize a simple yet effective decay strategy for $\\gamma$ :\n\n$$\n\\gamma=\\frac{T-T_{\\text {cur }}}{T}, \\gamma \\in[0,1]\n$$\n\nwhere $T$ is the total steps of training with LayerNorm and $T_{\\text {cur }}$ is the current step. This progressive strategy eases the difficulty of training a pure BN-based transformer and thus leads to strong performance on various tasks. There are some other decay strategies for attenuating the value of $\\gamma$ gradually, such as cosine decay and step decay.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Score: 0.69)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Xiaodong Han, Yunshen Wei, Baohong Lv, Fei Yuan, Xiao Luo, Y. Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** TransNormerLLM is presented, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency and develops a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** We present TransNormerLLM, the first linear attention-based Large Language Model (LLM) that outperforms conventional softmax attention-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

State Space Model State Space Model is based on the State Space Equation for sequence modeling (Gu et al. 2022b), using special initialization (Gu et al., 2020, 2022a), diagonalization assumptions (Gupta et al., 2022), and some techniques (Dao et al., 2022b) to achieve performance comparable to Transformers. On the other hand, due to the characteristics of the State Space Equation, it enables inference to be conducted within constant complexity (Gu et al., 2022b). Long Convolution Long convolution models ( Qin et al. 2023, Fu et al. 2023) utilize a kernel size equal to the input sequence length, facilitating a wider context compared to traditional convolutions. Training these models involves the efficient $O(n \\log n)$ Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) algorithm. However, long convolutions pose certain challenges, such as the need for causal convolution inference, which necessitates caching all historical computations similar to SA's key-value (KV) cache. The memory requirements for handling long sequences, coupled with the higher inference complexity compared to RNNs, make them less ideal for processing long sequences. Linear RNN Linear RNNs (Orvieto et al. 2023, Peng et al., 2023b), in contrast, stand out as more suitable replacements for SA in long-sequence modeling. A notable example is the RWKV (Peng et al. 2023b) model, a linear RNN-based LLM that has shown competitive performance against similarly scaled GPT models. ## 3 TRANSNORMERLLM\n\n### 3.1 ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENT\n\nIn this section, we thoroughly investigate each module of the network and propose several improvements to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. Below, we outline the key designs of each block along with the inspiration behind each change. For the details of configurations for TransNormerLLM variants from 385M to 175B parameters, see Appendix A\n\n### 3.1.1 IMPROVEMENT 1: PoSITION ENCODING\n\nIn TransNormer, DiagAttention is used at the lower layers to avoid dilution issues. However, this leads to a lack of global interaction between tokens. In TransNormerLLM, we leverage LRPE (Qin et al., 2023b) with exponential decay (Press et al., 2022, Qin et al., 2023a; Peng et al., 2023b) to address this issue, retaining full attention at the lower layers. The expression of our position encoding is as follows:\n\n$$\na_{s t}=\\mathbf{q}_{s}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{t} \\lambda^{s-t} \\exp ^{i \\theta(s-t)}\n$$\n\nwhich we call LRPE-d - Linearized Relative Positional Encoding with exponential decay. Similar to the original LRPE, we set $\\theta$ to be learnable. We empirically find that rather than applying LRPE-d to every layer, applying it to the first layer and keeping other layers with exponential decay can speed up training by approximately $15-20 \\%$ but only with a subtle effect on the performance. Note that this position encoding is fully compatible with Linear Attention, as it can be decomposed with respect to $s$ and $t$ separately. The value of $\\lambda$ for the $h$-th head in the $l$-th layer (assuming there are a total of $H$ heads and $L$ layers) is given by:\n\n$$\n\\lambda=\\exp \\left(-\\frac{8 h}{H} \\times\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\frac{8 h}{H}$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $h$-th head, while $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ corresponds to the decay rate of the $l$-th layer. The term $\\left(1-\\frac{l}{L}\\right)$ ensures that the Theoretical Receptive Fields (TRF) Qin et al. 2023c) at the lower layers is smaller compared to the higher layers, which aligns with TransNormer's motivation. It should be noted that the decay rate in the last layer is set to 1, allowing each token to attend to global information. We choose $\\lambda$ to be non-learnable since we empirically found that gradients become unstable when $\\lambda$ is learnable, leading to NaN values. ### 3.1.2 IMPROVEMENT 2: GATING MECHANISM\n\nGate can enhance the performance of the model and smooth the training process. In TransNormerLLM, we adopted the approach from Flash (Hua et al. 2022) and used the structure of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) in token mixing:\n\n$$\n\\text { TokenMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{U}\n$$\n\nwhere: $\\quad \\mathbf{Q}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}\\right), \\mathbf{K}=\\phi\\left(\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}\\right), \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}$. We choose $\\phi$ to be swish (Ramachandran et al. 2017) activation function as we empirically find that it outperforms other activation functions, as shown in Table 6\n\nTo further accelerate the model, we propose Simple GLU (SGLU), which removes the activation function from the original GLU structure as the gate itself can introduce non-linearity. Therefore, our channel mixing becomes:\n\n$$\n\\text { ChannelMixer : } \\mathbf{O}=[\\mathbf{V} \\odot \\mathbf{U}] \\mathbf{W}_{o}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}, \\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{u}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that not using an activation function in GLU will not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in Table 7 . ### 3.1.3 IMPROVEMENT 3: TENSOR NORMALIZATION\n\nWe employ the NormAttention introduced in TransNormer (Qin et al, 2022a) as follows:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis attention mechanism eliminates the softmax and scaling operation. Moreover, it can be transformed into linear attention through right multiplication:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{O}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nThis linear form allows for recurrent prediction with a complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, making it efficient during inference. Specifically, we only update $\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}$ in a recurrent manner without computing the full attention matrix. In TransNormerLLM, we replace the RMSNorm with a new simple normalization function called SimpleRMSNorm, abbreviated as SRMSNorm:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{x})=\\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|_{2} / \\sqrt{d}}\n$$\n\nWe empirically find that using SRMSNorm does not lead to any performance loss, as demonstrated in the ablation study in Table. 8 . ### 3.1.4 THE OVERALL STRUCTURE\n\nThe overall structure is illustrated in Figure 1. In this structure, the input $\\mathbf{X}$ is updated through two consecutive steps: First, it undergoes Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with the application of SimpleRMSNorm (SRMSNorm) normalization. Then, it goes through the Simple Gated Linear Unit (SGLU) with SRMSNorm normalization again. This overall architecture helps improve the model's performance based on the PreNorm approach. The pseudo-code of the overall process is as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{GLA}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X})) \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}=\\mathbf{X}+\\operatorname{SGLU}(\\operatorname{SRMSNorm}(\\mathbf{X}))\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n### 3.2 TraINING OPTIMIZATION\n\n### 3.2.1 Lightning Attention\n\nThe structure of linear attention allows for efficient attention calculation with a complexity\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_292835b4009c58e22eb5g-04.jpg?height=659&width=666&top_left_y=1687&top_left_x=1071)\n\nFigure 1: Architecture overview of the proposed model.

Most existing works target attention mechanisms or propose alternative normalization techniques without addressing hardware-level efficiencies.\n\n- **SLAB's Approach**: The SLAB paper replaces LayerNorm with BatchNorm to improve computational efficiency. However, BatchNorm has different characteristics and limitations (e.g., dependency on batch statistics) compared to RMSNorm. SLAB does not discuss cache utilization or block-wise processing in the context of RMSNorm.\n\n- **Normalization in Transformers**: RMSNorm offers computational benefits over LayerNorm by eliminating the need to compute mean statistics. However, it still may suffer from memory bandwidth bottlenecks due to multiple passes over activations, especially in long sequences or large models.\n\n- **Block-wise Processing Benefits**: Computing normalization statistics over smaller blocks can enhance cache utilization by ensuring data remains in cache during computations. This can significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve computational speed, particularly on modern hardware architectures with complex memory hierarchies.\n\n- **Selective State Compression**: Introducing a mechanism to compress and decompress intermediate statistics can further reduce memory usage. The challenge is to design compression methods that do not degrade the quality of normalization or impact model training adversely.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations**:\n\n  - **Training Stability**: Changes to normalization can affect the model's convergence behavior. It is essential to ensure that block-wise variance estimates are reliable substitutes for full-sequence statistics.\n\n  - **Gradient Computation**: Modifying the normalization layer impacts backpropagation. Careful implementation is needed to correctly compute gradients and maintain training efficiency.\n\n  - **Hardware Compatibility**: The effectiveness of hardware-aware optimizations may vary across different hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs). Optimizations should be designed to be portable or adaptable to various platforms.\n\n- **Alignment with Research Trends**: The proposal is in line with the broader movement towards efficient deep learning models.

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, M. Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

It involves two phases: constructing an affinity graph from available data and inferring labels for unlabeled nodes on this graph. While numerous algorithms have been developed for label inference, the crucial graph construction phase has received comparatively less attention, despite its significant influence on the subsequent phase. In this paper, we present an optimal asymmetric graph structure for the label inference phase with theoretical motivations. Unlike existing graph construction methods, we differentiate the distinct roles that labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes could play. Accordingly, we design an efficient block-wise graph learning algorithm with a global convergence guarantee. Other benefits induced by our method, such as enhanced robustness to noisy node features, are explored as well. Finally, we perform extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate its superiority to the state-of-the-art graph construction methods in GSSL.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware RMSNorm*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

HW-NAS-Bench: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware RMSNorm*\n\n*Chaojian Li, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Qixuan Yu, Yue Wang, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HW-NAS-Bench is developed, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW- NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NA research more reproducible and accessible and verify that dedicated device-specific HW- Nas can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.\n\n**Abstract:** HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

A Deep Learning Dataloader with Shared Data Preparation\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Deep Learning*\n\n*Jian Xie, Jingwei Xu, Guochang Wang, Yuan Yao, Zenan Li, Chun Cao, Hanghang Tong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new data loading method for efficiently training parallel DNNs with much flexible constraints is proposed, named J OADER, which can share data preparation work as long as the datasets are overlapped for different training jobs.\n\n**Abstract:** Parallelly executing multiple training jobs on overlapped datasets is a common practice in developing deep learning models. By default, each of the parallel jobs prepares (i.e., loads and preprocesses) the data independently, causing redundant consumption of I/O and CPU. Although a centralized cache component can reduce the redundancies by reusing the data preparation work, each job\u2019s random data shuffling results in a low sampling locality causing heavy cache thrashing. Prior work tries to improve the sampling locality by enforcing all the training jobs loading the same dataset in the same order and pace. However, such a solution is only efficient under strong constraints: all jobs are trained on the same dataset with the same starting moment and training speed. In this paper, we propose a new data loading method for efficiently training parallel DNNs with much flexible constraints. Our method is still highly efficient when different training jobs use different but overlapped datasets and have different starting moments and training speeds. To achieve this, we propose a dependent sampling algorithm (DSA) and a domain-specific cache policy. Moreover, a novel tree data structure is designed to efficiently implement DSA. Based on the proposed techniques, we implemented a prototype, named J OADER , which can share data preparation work as long as the datasets are overlapped for different training jobs. We evaluate the proposed J OADER , showing a greater versatility and superiority of training speed improvement (up to 200% on ResNet18) without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Reconciling \u03bb-Returns with Experience Replay\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Deep Learning*\n\n*Brett Daley, Chris Amato*\n\n**TL;DR:** The first method to enable practical use of \u03bb-returns in arbitrary replay-based methods without relying on other forms of decorrelation such as asynchronous gradient updates is proposed, which shows that these innovations can enhance the performance of DQN when playing Atari 2600 games, even under partial observability.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep reinforcement learning methods have departed from the incremental learning required for eligibility traces, rendering the implementation of the \u03bb-return difficult in this context. In particular, off-policy methods that utilize experience replay remain problematic because their random sampling of minibatches is not conducive to the efficient calculation of \u03bb-returns. Yet replay-based methods are often the most sample efficient, and incorporating \u03bb-returns into them is a viable way to achieve new state-of-the-art performance. Towards this, we propose the first method to enable practical use of \u03bb-returns in arbitrary replay-based methods without relying on other forms of decorrelation such as asynchronous gradient updates. By promoting short sequences of past transitions into a small cache within the replay memory, adjacent \u03bb-returns can be efficiently precomputed by sharing Q-values. Computation is not wasted on experiences that are never sampled, and stored \u03bb-returns behave as stable temporal-difference (TD) targets that replace the target network. Additionally, our method grants the unique ability to observe TD errors prior to sampling; for the first time, transitions can be prioritized by their true significance rather than by a proxy to it. Furthermore, we propose the novel use of the TD error to dynamically select \u03bb-values that facilitate faster learning. We show that these innovations can enhance the performance of DQN when playing Atari 2600 games, even under partial observability. While our work specifically focuses on \u03bb-returns, these ideas are applicable to any multi-step return estimator.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9. Moderate Coreset: A Universal Method of Data Selection for Real-world Data-efficient Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Deep Learning*\n\n*Xiaobo Xia, Jiale Liu, Jun Yu, Xu Shen, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A universal method that inherits the moderate coreset and uses the distance of a data point to its class center as the score criterion, is proposed to meet complex realistic scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning methods nowadays rely on massive data, resulting in substantial costs of data storage and model training. Data selection is a useful tool to alleviate such costs, where a coreset of massive data is extracted to practically perform on par with full data. Based on carefully-designed score criteria, existing methods first count the score of each data point and then select the data points whose scores lie in a certain range to construct a coreset. These methods work well in their respective preconceived scenarios but are not robust to the change of scenarios, since the optimal range of scores varies as the scenario changes. The issue limits the application of these methods, because realistic scenarios often mismatch preconceived ones, and it is inconvenient or unfeasible to tune the criteria and methods accordingly. In this paper, to address the issue, a concept of the moderate coreset is discussed. Specifically, given any score criterion of data selection, different scenarios prefer data points with scores in different intervals. As the score median is a proxy of the score distribution in statistics, the data points with scores close to the score median can be seen as a proxy of full data and generalize different scenarios, which are used to construct the moderate coreset. As a proof-of-concept, a universal method that inherits the moderate coreset and uses the distance of a data point to its class center as the score criterion, is proposed to meet complex realistic scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the advance of our method over prior state-of-the-art methods, leading to a strong baseline for future research.

MaskNet: Introducing Feature-Wise Multiplication to CTR Ranking Models by Instance-Guided Mask\n\n*From Search Query: Block-wise Normalization*\n\n*Junlin Zhang, Qingyun She, Zhiqiang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Click-Through Rate(CTR) estimation has become one of the most fundamental tasks in many real-world applications and it's important for ranking models to effectively capture complex high-order features. Shallow feed-forward network is widely used in many state-of-the-art DNN models such as FNN, DeepFM and xDeepFM to implicitly capture high-order feature interactions. However, some research has proved that addictive feature interaction, particular feed-forward neural networks, is inefficient in capturing common feature interaction. To resolve this problem, we introduce specific multiplicative operation into DNN ranking system by proposing instance-guided mask which performs element-wise product both on the feature embedding and feed-forward layers guided by input instance. We also turn the feed-forward layer in DNN model into a mixture of addictive and multiplicative feature interactions by proposing MaskBlock in this paper. MaskBlock combines the layer normalization, instance-guided mask, and feed-forward layer and it is a basic building block to be used to design new ranking model under various configurations. The model consisting of MaskBlock is called MaskNet in this paper and two new MaskNet models are proposed to show the effectiveness of MaskBlock as basic building block for composing high performance ranking systems. The experiment results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed MaskNet models outperform state-of-the-art models such as DeepFM and xDeepFM significantly, which implies MaskBlock is an effective basic building unit for composing new high performance ranking systems.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Block-wise Normalization*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Jitendra Malik, Karttikeya Mangalam, Nicholas Lee, Albert Shaw, Amir Gholami, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs.

Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Deep Learning*\n\n*Huizi Mao, William J. Dally, Song Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive,\nmaking them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware\nresources. To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three\nstage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work\ntogether to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x\nwithout affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by\nlearning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to\nenforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two\nsteps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the\nquantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x;\nQuantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection\nfrom 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required\nby AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method\nreduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of\naccuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than\noff-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of\ncomplex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and\ndownload bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU,\ncompressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy\nefficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2015-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Couler: Unified Machine Learning Workflow Optimization in Cloud\n\n*From Search Query: Cache-Efficient Deep Learning*\n\n*Mingjie Tang, Jiang Qian, Ke Zhang, Jian Sha, Jingji Wu, Bo Sang, Tengda Guo, Yuan Tang, Xiaoda Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine Learning (ML) has become ubiquitous, fueling data-driven applications across various organizations. Contrary to the traditional perception of ML in research, ML workflows can be complex, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Expanding an ML workflow to encompass a wider range of data infrastructure and data types may lead to larger workloads and increased deployment costs. Currently, numerous workflow engines are available (with over ten being widely recognized). This variety poses a challenge for end-users in terms of mastering different engine APIs. While efforts have primarily focused on optimizing ML Operations (MLOps) for a specific workflow engine, current methods largely overlook workflow optimization across different engines. In this work, we design and implement Couler, a system designed for unified ML workflow optimization in the cloud. Our main insight lies in the ability to generate an ML workflow using natural language (NL) descriptions. We integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) into workflow generation, and provide a unified programming interface for various workflow engines. This approach alleviates the need to understand various workflow engines' APIs. Moreover, Couler enhances workflow computation efficiency by introducing automated caching at multiple stages, enabling large workflow auto-parallelization and automatic hyperparameters tuning. These enhancements minimize redundant computational costs and improve fault tolerance during deep learning workflow training. Couler is extensively deployed in real-world production scenarios at Ant Group, handling approximately 22k workflows daily, and has successfully improved the CPU/Memory utilization by more than 15% and the workflow completion rate by around 17%.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that incorporates block-wise normalization and hardware-aware optimizations, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Block-Wise Normalization and Hardware-Aware Optimizations\n\n### Novelty and Potential Impact\nThe researcher's proposal to apply block-wise processing and hardware-aware optimizations to RMSNorm is novel, especially in the context of autoregressive language models.
