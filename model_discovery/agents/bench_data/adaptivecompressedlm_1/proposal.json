Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Hi-transformer: Hierarchical interactive transformer for efficient and effective long document modeling (Avg.

However, it has difficulty in handling long documents due to the quadratic complexity with input text length. In order to handle this problem, we propose a hierarchical interactive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) for efficient and effective long document modeling. Hi-Transformer models documents in a hierarchical way, i.e., first learns sentence representations and then learns document representations. It can effectively reduce the complexity and meanwhile capture global document context in the modeling of each sentence. More specifically, we first use a sentence Transformer to learn the representations of each sentence. Then we use a document Transformer to model the global document context from these sentence representations. Next, we use another sentence Transformer to enhance sentence modeling using the global document context. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling method to obtain document embedding. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Hi-Transformer in long document modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/13 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nYi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, and Donald Metzler. 2020.

AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. HiViT: A Simpler and More Efficient Design of Hierarchical Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Xiaosong Zhang, Yunjie Tian, Lingxi Xie, Wei Huang, Qi Dai, Qixiang Ye, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT, which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning), after pre-trained using masked autoencoder on ImageNet-1K.\n\n**Abstract:** There has been a debate on the choice of plain vs. hierarchical vision transformers, where researchers often believe that the former (e.g., ViT) has a simpler design but the latter (e.g., Swin) enjoys higher recognition accuracy. Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility, i.e., part of image patches or tokens are to be discarded, which seems to claim the advantages of plain vision transformers. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning. In particular, after pre-trained using masked autoencoder (MAE) on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a 84.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, a 53.3% box AP on COCO detection, and a 52.8% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, significantly surpassing the baseline.

When to Use Efficient Self Attention? Profiling Text, Speech and Image Transformer Variants\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Anuj Diwan, Eunsol Choi, David Harwath*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies input length thresholds at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory) and introduces L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the first unified study of the efficiency of self-attention-based Transformer variants spanning text, speech and vision. We identify input length thresholds (tipping points) at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory). To conduct this analysis for speech, we introduce L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model. We observe that these thresholds are (a) much higher than typical dataset sequence lengths and (b) dependent on the metric and modality, showing that choosing the right model depends on modality, task type (long-form vs. typical context) and resource constraints (time vs. memory). By visualising the breakdown of the computational costs for transformer components, we also show that non-self-attention components exhibit significant computational costs.

Pale Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone with Pale-Shaped Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Haoru Tan, Tianyi Wu, Sitong Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformers have shown promising performance in various vision tasks. To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global self-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local region to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a single attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention (PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region. Compared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation and memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual information under the similar computation complexity with previous local self-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general Vision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale Transformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the model size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224 ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones. For downstream tasks, our Pale Transformer backbone performs better than the recent state-of-the-art CSWin Transformer by a large margin on ADE20K semantic segmentation and COCO object detection & instance segmentation.

H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Radu Soricut, Zhenhai Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Proceeding:** acl-2021-5\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer architecture hierarchical attention*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods. The code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/moabarar/qna}.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory-efficient transformer architectures, hierarchical attention patterns, hardware-optimized implementations, and cache optimization strategies, here are some key insights and techniques:\n\n## Memory Management Techniques\n\n### Block-Based Processing and Sparse Attention\n- Using block-based processing can significantly improve memory efficiency. For instance, the \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" approach involves sharding the context heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens. This method ensures that the full context is covered while optimizing memory IO and achieving high parallelization.\n- Sparse attention mechanisms, such as those described in the S2-Attention architecture, can reduce memory usage by only considering the keys specified by the sparse attention pattern. This is implemented using a Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format to optimize memory efficiency.\n\n### Adaptive Memory Management\n- Adaptive memory management based on content importance can be beneficial. For example, techniques that dynamically allocate memory based on the relevance of tokens or segments in the input sequence can help in reducing overall memory usage.\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Patterns\n\n### Multi-Head Attention with Hierarchical Structure\n- The use of multi-head attention mechanisms can be enhanced by incorporating hierarchical structures. For instance, combining sparse and dense attention in a hybrid architecture can balance efficiency and performance. Each head can apply a unique strided attention pattern to cover different subsets of tokens, ensuring the full context is captured.\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms, such as those integrating hierarchical attention with temporal convolutional networks (e.g., iTransformer), can effectively capture both short-term and long-term dependencies.\n\n### Bi-Level Attention Mechanisms\n- Bi-level attention mechanisms, like the Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) in graph learning, can be adapted for sequence data. This involves characterizing each token with both node-level and cluster-level keys and queries, allowing for the integration of information across different granular levels.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Implementations\n\n### Optimized Kernel Design\n- The S2-Attention architecture includes a system implementation that optimizes kernel efficiency. Techniques such as MergeQ, which adaptively merges query segments, and Split-D, which splits the head dimension to reduce SRAM usage, can significantly improve hardware utilization.\n- Hardware accelerators, such as memristor-based in-memory computing, can be designed to efficiently handle transformer self-attention computations, reducing the computational overhead and improving performance.\n\n### Cache Optimization Strategies\n\n### Tiling and Memory Access Patterns\n- Optimizing memory access patterns through tiling strategies, similar to those used in FlashAttention, can minimize HBM I/O and ensure efficient computation by fitting Q, K, V matrices into SRAM. However, sparse attention requires careful handling to avoid warp divergence and reduce thread block underutilization.\n\n### Software Pipelining\n- Techniques like Split-D in the S2-Attention architecture can enable a larger degree of software pipelining, reducing SRAM usage and improving overall efficiency. This is particularly beneficial when the head dimension is optimized for the hardware.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Position Encoding Innovations\n- Innovations in position encoding, such as bilevel positional encoding (BiPE), can help in better length extrapolation and improve the model's ability to capture both local and global context. This can be combined with hierarchical attention patterns to enhance performance.\n\n### Low-Rank Approximations\n- Using low-rank approximations for self-attention, as proposed in the Linformer, can reduce the complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\) in both time and space, making the model more memory-efficient and scalable.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage hierarchical attention, optimized memory management, and hardware-friendly implementations.\n",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.39)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form. GLA has a 2D forget gate $\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\in(0,1)^{d_{k} \\times d_{v}}$ that varies over time:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere we now allow the hidden state to have varying dimensions. This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1. Central to the design of gated linear attention is the parameterization of $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ which requires a balance between parameter-efficiency, state size, and training efficiency.

However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures (Avg. Score: 0.34)\n\n*Michael Poli, Armin W.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/34 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4e2f7f37acb16cad0f07g-05.jpg?height=497&width=459&top_left_y=299&top_left_x=299)\n(a) Mega architecture. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4e2f7f37acb16cad0f07g-05.jpg?height=489&width=562&top_left_y=306&top_left_x=787)\n(b) Mega layer. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4e2f7f37acb16cad0f07g-05.jpg?height=418&width=372&top_left_y=344&top_left_x=1427)\n(c) Single-head attention unit.

Figure (b) illustrates the gated attention sub-layer equipped with EMA, while Figure (c) displays the details of a single-head attention unit. Multi-dimensional Damped EMA. To further improve the expressiveness of EMA, we introduce a multi-dimensional variant of EMA. Concretely, we first expand each dimension of the input sequence $\\boldsymbol{X}$ individually into $h$ dimensions via an expansion matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\boldsymbol{d} \\times h}$. Formally, for each dimension $j \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, d\\}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}_{t}^{(j)}=\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j} \\mathbf{x}_{t, j}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}$ is the $j$-th row of $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\mathbf{u}_{t}^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}$ is the expanded $h$-dimensional vector for the $j$-th dimension at timestep $t$. Correspondingly, we extend the shape of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ from a one-dimensional vector to a two-dimensional matrix, i.e. $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}, \\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\boldsymbol{d} \\times h}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j}, \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}$ denote the $j$-th row of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$, respectively. Then, for each dimension $j$, the damped EMA is applied to the $h$-dimensional hidden space:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{(j)} & =\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j} \\odot \\mathbf{u}_{t}^{(j)}+\\left(1-\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{j}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{(j)} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{t, j} & =\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j}^{T} \\mathbf{h}_{t}^{(j)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{(j)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}$ is the EMA hidden state for the $j$-th dimension at timestep $t . \\boldsymbol{\\eta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times h}$ is the projection matrix to map the $h$-dimensional hidden state back to 1-dimensional output $\\mathbf{y}_{t, j} \\in \\mathbb{R} . \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h}$ is the $\\boldsymbol{j}$-th row of $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$. The output $\\boldsymbol{Y}$ from (5) is denoted as $\\boldsymbol{Y} \\triangleq \\operatorname{EMA}(\\boldsymbol{X})$. Because we do not need to explicitly compute $\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{(j)}$ to get the output $\\mathbf{y}_{t, j}$, and the time and space complexity is similar to the standard EMA in (2) (see Appendix A for the details). Experimental improvements demonstrate its effectiveness (\u00a74). ### 3.2 Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\nThe gated attention mechanism in MegA adopts the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU; Cho et al. (2014)) and Gated Attention Unit (GAU; Hua et al. (2022)) as the backbone architectures,\nwith an EMA-based sub-layer embedded into the calculation of the attention matrix. Formally, we first use the output from (5) to compute the shared representation in GAU:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\prime} & =\\operatorname{EMA}(\\boldsymbol{X}) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{Z} & =\\phi_{\\text {silu }}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\prime} W_{z}+b_{z}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times z}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{X}^{\\prime}$ can be regarded as the updated or contextual input, because it encodes contextual information through EMA. $\\boldsymbol{Z}$ is the shared representation with $z$ dimensions, with projection matrix $W_{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times z}$ and bias term $b_{z} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{z}$. $\\phi_{\\text {silu }}$ is the self-gated activation function (SiLU) (Ramachandran et al., 2017; Elfwing et al., 2018). Following GAU, the query and key sequences are computed by applying per-dimension scalars and offsets to $\\boldsymbol{Z}$, and the value sequence is from the original $\\boldsymbol{X}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\boldsymbol{Q} & =\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_{q} \\odot \\boldsymbol{Z}+\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{q} & & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times z} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{K} & =\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_{k} \\odot \\boldsymbol{Z}+\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{k} & & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times z} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{V} & =\\phi_{\\mathrm{silu}}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X} W_{v}+b_{v}\\right) & & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{\\kappa}_{k}, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{z}$ are the learnable scalars and offsets of queries and keys, respectively. $v$ is the expanded intermediate dimension for the value sequence. The output of attention is computed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{O}=f\\left(\\frac{\\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{K}^{T}}{\\tau(\\boldsymbol{X})}+\\boldsymbol{b}_{\\mathrm{rel}}\\right) \\boldsymbol{V}\n$$\n\nThe graphical specification is displayed in Figure 2 (c). $\\boldsymbol{b}_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is the relative positional bias.

However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/28 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.

Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode. These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: gated linear attention implementation token processing\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention implementation token processing*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Mixture of Attention Heads: Selecting Attention Heads Per Token\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention implementation token processing*\n\n*Xiaofeng Zhang, Yikang Shen, Zeyu Huang, Jie Zhou, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism, is proposed, which can easily scale up the number of attention heads and theNumber of parameters while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks have been proposed as an efficient way to scale up model capacity and implement conditional computing. However, the study of MoE components mostly focused on the feedforward layer in Transformer architecture. This paper proposes the Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism. MoA includes a set of attention heads that each has its own set of parameters. Given an input, a router dynamically selects a subset of k attention heads per token. This conditional computation schema allows MoA to achieve stronger performance than the standard multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, the sparsely gated MoA can easily scale up the number of attention heads and the number of parameters while preserving computational efficiency. Despite performance improvements, MoA also automatically differentiates heads\u2019 utilities, providing a new perspective to discuss the model\u2019s interpretability. We conducted experiments on several important tasks, including Machine Translation and Masked Language Modeling.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention implementation token processing*\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

You Only Sample (Almost) Once: Linear Cost Self-Attention Via Bernoulli Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: gated linear attention implementation token processing*\n\n*Zhanpeng Zeng, Yunyang Xiong, Sathya Ravi, Shailesh Acharya, G. Fung, Vikas Singh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Central to the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends quadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by considering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with Bernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a single hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies on specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures). We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence length where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained Transformer. On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, for evaluating performance on long sequences, our method achieves results consistent with softmax self-attention but with sizable speed-ups and memory savings and often outperforms other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mlpen/YOSO\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on gated linear attention, token-based processing, and the integration of hierarchical structures, here are some key implementation techniques and insights:\n\n## Implementation Techniques for Gated Linear Attention\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Mechanism\nGLA introduces a gating mechanism to control the flow of information in the recurrent updates of the self-attention mechanism. This is crucial for managing the accumulation of past information and preventing the values in the recurrent state from growing indefinitely.\n\n- **Gating Mechanism**: GLA uses a learned outer-product-based gating mechanism that decays every element of the recurrent state. This is achieved through learnable parameters and gating vectors, allowing the network to learn the decay rate for each element of the state. The gating mechanism is defined using sigmoid functions and outer products to control the flow of past information.\n\n- **Recurrent Updates**: The update equations for the recurrent state and normalization vector are modified to include the gating mechanism. This ensures that the model can add and delete previous information effectively, which is essential for length generalization and preventing the accumulation of arbitrary positive values.\n\n### Multi-Head Attention Integration\nGLA can be integrated with multi-head attention to capture various representations of the input. By dividing the dimensions into multiple heads, each head performs its own linear attention variant, reducing computational complexity while maintaining expressiveness.\n\n## Token-Based Processing and Neighborhood Search Methods\n\n### Token-Based Search\nAtMan introduces a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity in the embedding space. This approach replaces traditional backpropagation and can be more efficient for certain tasks.\n\n- **Cosine Similarity Neighborhood**: Tokens are processed by searching for neighbors in the embedding space based on cosine similarity. This method can reduce the complexity of attention mechanisms by focusing on relevant tokens rather than computing attention weights for all tokens.\n\n### Efficient Token Processing\nEfficient token processing can be achieved by using block-based processing and sparse attention patterns. This approach can significantly improve memory efficiency by only computing attention for relevant blocks of tokens.\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: Dividing the input sequence into blocks and applying attention mechanisms within these blocks can reduce the computational and memory requirements. This is particularly useful when combined with adaptive memory management based on content importance[Analysis].\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical Structures with Gated Mechanisms\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Structures\nHierarchical attention structures can balance efficiency and performance by processing information at different granularities.\n\n- **Hierarchical Patch Embedding**: HiViT simplifies hierarchical designs by using hierarchical patch embedding, which removes unnecessary operations while maintaining performance. This can be integrated with gated mechanisms to enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently[Analysis].\n\n### Bi-Level Attention Mechanisms\nBi-level attention mechanisms can integrate information across different granularities, combining the benefits of hierarchical structures with the efficiency of gated linear attention.\n\n- **Combining Hierarchical and Gated Mechanisms**: By combining hierarchical attention structures with gated linear attention, the model can capture diverse relationships within the input data while controlling the flow of information effectively. This approach can improve length generalization and reduce computational costs[Analysis].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Hardware Optimization\nOptimizing the model for hardware can further enhance performance. Techniques such as kernel optimization (e.g., MergeQ and Split-D), tiling strategies to minimize HBM I/O, and software pipelining to reduce SRAM usage are crucial for real-world performance[Analysis].\n\n### Memory Efficiency\nAdaptive memory management based on content importance and hardware-aware context sharding among attention heads can significantly improve memory efficiency. Block-based processing with adaptive sizing can also prioritize important information, reducing memory usage[Analysis].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is more efficient, scalable, and performant, especially in terms of length generalization and memory management.\n",

Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/24 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\n# SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling \n\nBiqing $\\mathbf{Q i}^{1 \\mathbf{1 , 2 , 4 , *}}$, Junqi Gao ${ }^{\\mathbf{3}, *}$, Kaiyan Zhang ${ }^{\\mathbf{2}}$, Dong $\\mathbf{L i}^{\\mathbf{3}}$, Jianxing Liu ${ }^{\\mathbf{1}}$, Ligang $\\mathbf{W u}^{\\mathbf{1 , \\dagger}}$, Bowen $\\mathbf{Z h o u}{ }^{2, \\dagger}$<br>${ }^{1}$ Department of Control Science and Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology,<br>${ }^{2}$ Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University,<br>${ }^{3}$ School of Mathematics, Harbin Institute of Technology,<br>${ }^{4}$ Frontis.AI, Beijing<br>\\{qibiqing7,gjunqi97, arvinlee826\\}@gmail.com,<br>zhang-ky22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn, \\{jx.liu,ligangwu\\}@hit.edu.cn, zhoubowen@tsinghua.edu.cn\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nDespite the promising performance of state space models (SSMs) in long sequence modeling, limitations still exist.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5.

This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state management long sequence models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work finds vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and improves the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Decision S4: Efficient Sequence-Based RL via State Spaces Layers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Shmuel Bar-David, Itamar Zimerman, Eliya Nachmani, Lior Wolf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results indicate that the method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making the approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, sequence learning methods have been applied to the problem of off-policy Reinforcement Learning, including the seminal work on Decision Transformers, which employs transformers for this task. Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model. We focus on the structure of the convolution kernel and identify two critical but intuitive principles enjoyed by S4 that are sufficient to make up an effective global convolutional model: 1) The parameterization of the convolutional kernel needs to be efficient in the sense that the number of parameters should scale sub-linearly with sequence length. 2) The kernel needs to satisfy a decaying structure that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. Based on the two principles, we propose a simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv). SGConv exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks: 1) With faster speed, SGConv surpasses S4 on Long Range Arena and Speech Command datasets. 2) When plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models, it shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 82  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Online Portfolio Management via Deep Reinforcement Learning with High-Frequency Data\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*LiangWei Chen, Xingyu Yang, Yong Zhang, Jiahao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, models that based on Transformer have yielded superior results in many sequence modeling tasks. The ability of Transformer to capture long-range dependencies and interactions makes it possible to apply it in the field of portfolio management (PM). However, the built-in quadratic complexity of the Transformer prevents its direct application to the PM task. To solve this problem, in this paper,  we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based PM framework called LSRE-CAAN, with two important components: a long sequence representations extractor and a cross-asset attention network. Direct Policy Gradient is used to solve the sequential decision problem in the PM process.} We conduct numerical experiments in three aspects using four different cryptocurrency datasets, and the empirical results show that our framework is more effective than both traditional and state-of-the-art (SOTA) online portfolio strategies, achieving a 6x return on the best dataset. In terms of risk metrics, our framework has an average volatility risk of 0.46 and an average maximum drawdown risk of 0.27 across the four datasets, both of which are lower than the vast majority of SOTA strategies. In addition, while the vast majority of SOTA strategies maintain a poor turnover rate of approximately greater than 50% on average, our framework enjoys a relatively low turnover rate on all datasets, efficiency analysis illustrates that our framework no longer has the quadratic dependency limitation.\n\n**Proceeding:** information-processing-management-2023-5\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. EchoMamba4Rec: Harmonizing Bidirectional State Space Models with Spectral Filtering for Advanced Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Shengxin Zhu, Xuxin He, Yuda Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Predicting user preferences and sequential dependencies based on historical behavior is the core goal of sequential recommendation. Although attention-based models have shown effectiveness in this field, they often struggle with inference inefficiency due to the quadratic computational complexity inherent in attention mechanisms, especially with long-range behavior sequences. Drawing inspiration from the recent advancements of state space models (SSMs) in control theory, which provide a robust framework for modeling and controlling dynamic systems, we introduce EchoMamba4Rec. Control theory emphasizes the use of SSMs for managing long-range dependencies and maintaining inferential efficiency through structured state matrices. EchoMamba4Rec leverages these control relationships in sequential recommendation and integrates bi-directional processing with frequency-domain filtering to capture complex patterns and dependencies in user interaction data more effectively. Our model benefits from the ability of state space models (SSMs) to learn and perform parallel computations, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and scalability. It features a bi-directional Mamba module that incorporates both forward and reverse Mamba components, leveraging information from both past and future interactions. Additionally, a filter layer operates in the frequency domain using learnable Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and learnable filters, followed by an inverse FFT to refine item embeddings and reduce noise. We also integrate Gate Linear Units (GLU) to dynamically control information flow, enhancing the model's expressiveness and training stability. Experimental results demonstrate that EchoMamba significantly outperforms existing models, providing more accurate and personalized recommendations.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. MARVEL: MR Fingerprinting with Additional micRoVascular Estimates using bidirectional LSTMs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management long sequence models*\n\n*Thomas Christen, Benjamin Lemasson, Aur\u00e9lien Delphin, Thomas Coudert, Antoine Barrier*\n\n**Abstract:** The Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) approach aims to estimate multiple MR or physiological parameters simultaneously with a single fast acquisition sequence. Most of the MRF studies proposed so far have used simple MR sequence types to measure relaxation times (T1, T2). In that case, deep learning algorithms have been successfully used to speed up the reconstruction process. In theory, the MRF concept could be used with a variety of other MR sequence types and should be able to provide more information about the tissue microstructures. Yet, increasing the complexity of the numerical models often leads to prohibited simulation times, and estimating multiple parameters from one sequence implies new dictionary dimensions whose sizes become too large for standard computers and DL architectures.In this paper, we propose to analyze the MRF signal coming from a complex balance Steady-state free precession (bSSFP) type sequence to simultaneously estimate relaxometry maps (T1, T2), Field maps (B1, B0) as well as microvascular properties such as the local Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV) or the averaged vessel Radius (R).To bypass the curse of dimensionality, we propose an efficient way to simulate the MR signal coming from numerical voxels containing realistic microvascular networks as well as a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network used for the matching process.On top of standard MRF maps, our results on 3 human volunteers suggest that our approach can quickly produce high-quality quantitative maps of microvascular parameters that are otherwise obtained using longer dedicated sequences and intravenous injection of a contrast agent. This approach could be used for the management of multiple pathologies and could be tuned to provide other types of microstructural information.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state management for long sequence processing, here are some key techniques and methods derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## State Management Techniques for Long Sequence Processing\n\n### Input-Dependent State Transitions\nThe S7 model introduces input-dependent state transitions in state-space models (SSMs), which allows the model to dynamically adjust its state transitions based on the input content. This approach enhances the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies and filter out irrelevant information, making it more robust and efficient for long-sequence tasks.\n\n### Selective Updating of Internal States\nS7 also employs selective updating of internal states, which balances long-term and short-term dependencies. This is achieved through a gating mechanism that regulates the flow of information based on the input signal and the current state, ensuring that the model retains relevant information while discarding irrelevant data.\n\n### Reparameterization for Stability\nTo ensure stability during long-sequence modeling, S7 uses a reparameterization of the transition matrix inspired by StableSSM. This reparameterization guarantees that the eigenvalues of the matrix remain within a stable range, preventing unstable behavior over time.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of State Tracking\n\n### Hierarchical and Block-Based Processing\nImplementing hierarchical attention patterns and block-based processing with adaptive block sizes can significantly improve memory efficiency. This approach allows for multi-scale processing, which can better handle varying sequence lengths and reduce memory overhead[Analysis].\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nDesigning models with hardware-aware memory access patterns can optimize memory utilization. For example, using I/O-aware algorithms and optimizing parallel computation can enhance throughput and reduce memory usage[Analysis].\n\n## Methods for Maintaining and Updating Hidden States Efficiently\n\n### Gated Mechanisms\nGated mechanisms, such as those used in Gated Linear Attention Transformers and Mega, can efficiently manage hidden states. These mechanisms use data-dependent gates to adaptively compute and update hidden states, maintaining linear complexity while enhancing expressiveness[Analysis].\n\n### State-Space Models (SSMs)\nIntegrating SSMs, as seen in SC-MAMBA2 and S7, can efficiently handle ultra-long sequences by leveraging the efficiency and scalability of SSMs. These models use bidirectional modeling approaches and input-dependent dynamics to manage and update hidden states efficiently.\n\n### Adaptive State Evolution\nThe S7 model's dynamic gating mechanism allows for adaptive state evolution based on the input signal and current state. This mechanism ensures that the model can control the flow of information, selectively retaining and filtering out information as needed.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Training Strategies\nTraining models in stages with increasing sequence length, as done with XGen-7B, can help the model adapt to longer sequences efficiently. This approach involves training on shorter sequences first and then gradually increasing the sequence length, which helps in managing memory and computational resources.\n\n### Optimization Techniques\nOptimizing models through techniques such as reparameterization, stable state transitions, and efficient gating mechanisms can improve both the performance and the efficiency of state management in long-sequence models[Analysis].\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in state management, capable of handling long sequences, and optimized for both performance and computational resources.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.58)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg. Score: 0.50)\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time, and TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/51 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nThis compression has two consequences. On one hand, mapping an input token $x_{t}$ to output token $z_{t}$ is efficient, because both the update rule and output rule take constant time per token. On the other hand, the performance of RNN layers in long context is limited by the expressive power of its hidden state $s_{t}$.

Top: A generic sequence modeling layer expressed as a hidden state that transitions according to an update rule. All sequence modeling layers can be viewed as different instantiations of three components in this figure: the initial state, update rule and output rule. Bottom: Examples of sequence modeling layers and their instantiations of the three components. The naive TTT layer was shown in Figure 1. Self-attention has a hidden state growing with context, therefore growing cost per token. Both the naive RNN and TTT layer compress the growing context into a hidden state of fixed size, therefore their cost per token stays constant. Self-attention can also be viewed from the perspective above, except that its hidden state, commonly known as the Key-Value (KV) cache, is a list that grows linearly with $t$. Its update rule simply appends the current KV tuple to this list, and the output rule scans over all tuples up to $t$ to form the attention matrix. The hidden state explicitly stores all historic context without compression, making self-attention more expressive than RNN layers for long context. However, scanning this linearly growing hidden state also takes linearly growing time per token. To remain both efficient and expressive in long context, we need a better compression heuristic. Specifically, we need to compress thousands or potentially millions of tokens into a hidden state that can effectively capture their underlying structures and relationships. This might sound like a tall order, but all of us are actually already familiar with such a heuristic. ### 2.1 TTT as updating a hidden state\n\nThe process of parametric learning can be viewed as compressing a massive training set into the weights of a model. Specifically, we know that models trained with self-supervision can capture the underlying structures and relationships behind their training data [48] - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. LLMs themselves are great examples. Trained with the self-supervised task of next-token prediction, their weights can be viewed as a compressed form of storage for existing knowledge on the internet. By querying LLMs, we can extract knowledge from their weights. More importantly, LLMs often exhibit a deep understanding of the semantic connections among existing knowledge to express new pieces of reasoning [1]. Our key idea is to use self-supervised learning to compress the historic context $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$ into a hidden state $s_{t}$, by making the context an unlabeled dataset and the state a model. Concretely, the hidden state $s_{t}$ is now equivalent to $W_{t}$, the weights of a model $f$, which can be a linear model, a\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-05.jpg?height=354&width=1491&top_left_y=321&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 5.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 4 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive state compression hardware optimization memory management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression hardware optimization memory management*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. MCUFormer: Deploying Vision Tranformers on Microcontrollers with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression hardware optimization memory management*\n\n*Yinan Liang, Ziwei Wang, Xiuwei Xu, Yansong Tang, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory called MCUFormer is proposed, where the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) is generalized to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the micro Controllers.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the high price and heavy energy consumption of GPUs, deploying deep models on IoT devices such as microcontrollers makes significant contributions for ecological AI. Conventional methods successfully enable convolutional neural network inference of high resolution images on microcontrollers, while the framework for vision transformers that achieve the state-of-the-art performance in many vision applications still remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimizations method called MCUFormer to deploy vision transformers on microcontrollers with extremely limited memory, where we jointly design transformer architecture and construct the inference operator library to fit the memory resource constraint. More specifically, we generalize the one-shot network architecture search (NAS) to discover the optimal architecture with highest task performance given the memory budget from the microcontrollers, where we enlarge the existing search space of vision transformers by considering the low-rank decomposition dimensions and patch resolution for memory reduction. For the construction of the inference operator library of vision transformers, we schedule the memory buffer during inference through operator integration, patch embedding decomposition, and token overwriting, allowing the memory buffer to be fully utilized to adapt to the forward pass of the vision transformer. Experimental results demonstrate that our MCUFormer achieves 73.62\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet for image classification with 320KB memory on STM32F746 microcontroller.

Extreme Tensoring for Low-Memory Preconditioning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression hardware optimization memory management*\n\n*Xinyi Chen, Naman Agarwal, Elad Hazan, Cyril Zhang, Yi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes extreme tensoring for high-dimensional stochastic optimization, showing that an optimizer needs very little memory to benefit from adaptive preconditioning.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models are now trained with billions of parameters, reaching hardware limits in terms of memory consumption. This has created a recent demand for memory-efficient optimizers. To this end, we investigate the limits and performance tradeoffs of memory-efficient adaptively preconditioned gradient methods. We propose extreme tensoring for high-dimensional stochastic optimization, showing that an optimizer needs very little memory to benefit from adaptive preconditioning. Our technique applies to arbitrary models (not necessarily with tensor-shaped parameters), and is accompanied by regret and convergence guarantees, which shed light on the tradeoffs between preconditioner quality and expressivity. On a large-scale NLP model, we reduce the optimizer memory overhead by three orders of magnitude, without degrading performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive state compression, hardware-optimized memory management, and efficient state update mechanisms, here are some key insights and techniques:\n\n## Adaptive State Compression Techniques and Algorithms\n\n### Adaptive Dictionary Methods\nAdaptive dictionary methods, such as those used in the Lempel-Ziv algorithm, can be adapted for state compression. These methods build a table of frequently occurring strings or patterns and replace them with shorter codes. For state compression in language models, this could involve identifying and compressing recurring patterns in the model's state.\n\n### Context-Dependent Compression\nThe LZMA algorithm, which uses context-dependent compression, can be a model for adaptive state compression. LZMA uses a complex model to predict each bit based on the context of previous bits, which can be applied to compressing the state of a language model by considering the context of previous states.\n\n### Token Saliency\nAdaptive KV cache compression, as mentioned in the context of large language models (LLMs), involves discerning the saliency of tokens and preserving vital information while aggressively compressing less important tokens. This approach can be extended to state compression by identifying and prioritizing the most critical components of the model's state.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Management\nHierarchical memory management can significantly reduce overhead by leveraging different levels of memory (e.g., cache, main memory, and storage). For language models, this could involve storing less frequently accessed states in slower but larger memory and more frequently accessed states in faster but smaller memory. This approach aligns with the block-based processing and adaptive sizing mentioned in the analysis.\n\n### Dynamic and Static Compression Tables\nUsing dynamic or static compression tables, as discussed in the Intel ISA-L compression algorithms, can be applied to memory management. Dynamic tables can offer better compression ratios but at the cost of more processing time, while static tables provide higher throughput but lower compression ratios. This trade-off can be optimized based on the specific needs of the language model.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nImplementations that are aware of hardware constraints, such as those described in \"Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions,\" can significantly improve performance. Techniques like squashing kernel weights to achieve smooth kernels can be adapted to optimize memory usage and state updates in language models.\n\n## Efficient State Update Mechanisms for Long Sequences\n\n### State Memory Replay\nThe concept of State Memory Replay (SMR) from \"SMR: State Memory Replay for Long Sequence Modeling\" suggests adjusting input sequences with early memories to mitigate non-uniform sampling issues. This can be applied to improve state stability and efficiency in updating states for long sequences.\n\n### Dense Hidden Connections\nThe DenseMamba approach, which involves selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, can help in maintaining fine-grained information crucial for the final output. This method ensures that important state information is retained across different layers, which is essential for efficient state updates.\n\n### Position Encoding and Adaptive Mechanisms\nImproving position encoding to better handle varying sequence lengths is crucial. Adaptive mechanisms, such as those suggested in the analysis, can help in dynamically adjusting the model's state based on the sequence length and content, ensuring efficient and accurate state updates.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that optimize state compression, memory management, and state updates, leading to improved performance on long sequences and better overall efficiency.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training large language models\" \"state compression techniques comparison\" \"hardware optimization attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster. Notably, our work considers models with tens of billions of parameters, which is up to $100\\times$ larger than what has been previously considered in the structured pruning literature.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training large language models\" \"state compression techniques comparison\" \"hardware optimization attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Yu Qiao, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long\nsequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP\nmethods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in\nsub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based\nlanguage models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel\n(LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language\nmodels. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication\nmechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which\nsharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the\npractical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state\ncaching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters.\nFurthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP\nwith all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for\ndistributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with\nvarying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up\nto 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than\nexisting SP methods while being significantly faster.

Rodimus*: Breaking the Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-Off with Efficient\n  Attentions\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training large language models\" \"state compression techniques comparison\" \"hardware optimization attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zhihao He, Hang Yu, Zi Gong, Shizhan Liu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have\nset new standards in natural language processing. However, the classical\nsoftmax attention incurs significant computational costs, leading to a $O(T)$\ncomplexity for per-token generation, where $T$ represents the context length.\nThis work explores reducing LLMs' complexity while maintaining performance by\nintroducing Rodimus and its enhanced version, Rodimus$+$. Rodimus employs an\ninnovative data-dependent tempered selection (DDTS) mechanism within a linear\nattention-based, purely recurrent framework, achieving significant accuracy\nwhile drastically reducing the memory usage typically associated with recurrent\nmodels. This method exemplifies semantic compression by maintaining essential\ninput information with fixed-size hidden states. Building on this, Rodimus$+$\ncombines Rodimus with the innovative Sliding Window Shared-Key Attention\n(SW-SKA) in a hybrid approach, effectively leveraging the complementary\nsemantic, token, and head compression techniques. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Rodimus$+$-1.6B, trained on 1 trillion tokens, achieves superior\ndownstream performance against models trained on more tokens, including\nQwen2-1.5B and RWKV6-1.6B, underscoring its potential to redefine the\naccuracy-efficiency balance in LLMs. Model code and pre-trained checkpoints\nwill be available soon.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-09T06:22:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-09T06:22:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. SliM-LLM: Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training large language models\" \"state compression techniques comparison\" \"hardware optimization attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Wei Huang, Haotong Qin, Yangdong Liu, Yawei Li, Xianglong Liu, Luca Benini, Michele Magno, Xiaojuan Qi*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in natural\nlanguage understanding but require substantial computation and memory\nresources. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a powerful compression technique\nextensively investigated in LLMs. However, existing PTQ methods are still not\nideal in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially with below 4 bit-widths.\nStandard PTQ methods using group-wise quantization suffer difficulties in\nquantizing LLMs accurately to such low-bit, but advanced methods remaining\nhigh-precision weights element-wisely are hard to realize their theoretical\nhardware efficiency. This paper presents a Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision\nQuantization scheme for LLMs, namely SliM-LLM. The scheme exploits the salience\ndistribution of weights to determine optimal bit-width and quantizers for\naccurate LLM quantization, while aligning bit-width partition to groups for\ncompact memory usage and fast integer inference. Specifically, the proposed\nSliM-LLM mainly relies on two novel techniques: (1) Salience-Determined Bit\nAllocation utilizes the clustering characteristics of salience distribution to\nallocate the bit-widths of each group, increasing the accuracy of quantized\nLLMs and maintaining the inference efficiency; (2) Salience-Weighted Quantizer\nCalibration optimizes the parameters of the quantizer by considering the\nelement-wise salience within the group, balancing the maintenance of salient\ninformation and minimization of errors. Comprehensive experiments show that\nSliM-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs at ultra-low bits, e.g.,\n2-bit LLaMA-7B achieves a 5.5-times memory-saving than original model on NVIDIA\nA800 GPUs, and 48% decrease of perplexity compared to the state-of-the-art\ngradient-free PTQ method. Moreover, SliM-LLM+, which is integrated from the\nextension of SliM-LLM with gradient-based quantizers, further reduces\nperplexity by 35.1%.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-23T16:21:48Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-23T16:21:48Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on test-time training, state compression, and hardware optimization, here are some key points and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Test-Time Training Implementations\n\n### Active Fine-Tuning at Test-Time\nThe concept of test-time fine-tuning involves fine-tuning the model specifically to the given task at test time. This approach has been shown to significantly improve performance, especially when selecting relevant data for fine-tuning. For instance, the work on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" highlights that fine-tuning on data related to the prompt can improve performance substantially. This method uses techniques like SIFT (Selective Influence Function-based Fine-Tuning) to select the most relevant data, which is more effective and robust than Nearest Neighbor retrieval.\n\n### Integration with Reinforcement Learning\nThe o1 model from OpenAI integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with test-time compute, enabling the model to think through problems using chains of thought and backtracking. This approach enhances the model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in STEM fields, and demonstrates the potential for general AI reasoning by combining RL with LLMs.\n\n## Comparative Analysis of State Compression Methods\n\n### Compressed Activations\nThe \"CompAct\" method involves storing low-rank, compressed activations to reduce memory usage. This technique reduces peak memory utilization by 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning, using random projection matrices to avoid additional memory overheads. This is a significant advancement in memory-efficient training and fine-tuning of LLMs[Analysis Summary, referenced from Shamshoum et al., 2024].\n\n### Influence Functions for Data Selection\nIn contrast to Nearest Neighbor retrieval, using influence functions for data selection, as discussed in the context of SIFT, provides a more robust and effective way to select relevant data for fine-tuning. This method avoids the selection of redundant data and improves the sample efficiency of test-time fine-tuning.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\nGLA is designed to be hardware-efficient, trading off memory movement against parallelizability. It is particularly effective at length generalization, enabling models trained on short sequences to generalize to much longer sequences. This makes GLA a promising choice for hardware-aware implementations[Analysis Summary, referenced from Yang et al., 2023].\n\n### Optimizing State Management\nHardware optimization strategies need to consider the memory-computation trade-off. Techniques like Hidden-State Optimization (HSO) update cached hidden states rather than model parameters, which can improve performance on datasets like WikiText103 and PG-19 while being mindful of memory usage[Analysis Summary, referenced from Yoshida & Gimpel, 2021].\n\n## Integration Approaches for Combining Test-Time Training with Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Combining GLA with Test-Time Training\nTo integrate GLA with test-time training, careful state management is crucial. This involves balancing state size with recall ability and ensuring that memory optimization does not compromise model expressiveness. The use of compressed activations and efficient data selection methods can help in this integration[Analysis Summary].\n\n### VerifierQ and Q-Learning\nThe VerifierQ approach integrates Offline Q-learning into LLM verifier models, which can enhance the synergy between generation and evaluation capabilities. This method addresses challenges like handling utterance-level Markov Decision Processes and managing large action spaces, potentially enabling more robust and adaptive reasoning in LLMs. This can be combined with efficient attention mechanisms like GLA to improve overall performance.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks\n\n### Performance Gains\nTest-time fine-tuning can significantly improve performance metrics such as perplexity and accuracy. For example, the SIFT method shows consistent and robust improvements in performance compared to Nearest Neighbor retrieval.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\nState compression techniques like CompAct can reduce memory usage substantially, which is critical for practical efficiency in large language models. These techniques need to be evaluated on benchmarks that measure both memory usage and model performance[Analysis Summary].\n\n### Inference-Time Compute Scaling\nThe o1 model demonstrates that increasing inference-time compute can lead to significant improvements in reasoning capabilities, especially in complex tasks. This highlights the importance of optimizing both train-time and test-time compute to achieve better overall performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage test-time training, state compression, and hardware optimization effectively.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 557  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n#### 3.

An analytic theory of generalization dynamics and transfer learning in deep linear networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"test-time training\" \"RWKV\"*\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, S. Ganguli*\n\n**TL;DR:** An analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks is developed and reveals that knowledge transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature alignments of pairs of tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Much attention has been devoted recently to the generalization puzzle in deep learning: large, deep networks can generalize well, but existing theories bounding generalization error are exceedingly loose, and thus cannot explain this striking performance. Furthermore, a major hope is that knowledge may transfer across tasks, so that multi-task learning can improve generalization on individual tasks. However we lack analytic theories that can quantitatively predict how the degree of knowledge transfer depends on the relationship between the tasks. We develop an analytic theory of the nonlinear dynamics of generalization in deep linear networks, both within and across tasks. In particular, our theory provides analytic solutions to the training and testing error of deep networks as a function of training time, number of examples, network size and initialization, and the task structure and SNR. Our theory reveals that deep networks progressively learn the most important task structure first, so that generalization error at the early stopping time primarily depends on task structure and is independent of network size. This suggests any tight bound on generalization error must take into account task structure, and explains observations about real data being learned faster than random data. Intriguingly our theory also reveals the existence of a learning algorithm that proveably out-performs neural network training through gradient descent. Finally, for transfer learning, our theory reveals that knowledge transfer depends sensitively, but computably, on the SNRs and input feature alignments of pairs of tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 121  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

However, their original\nformulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched\ntransformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to\naddress these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating\narchitectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data\nand compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is\nlimited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a\ncost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose\nScalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to\nuptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks\n(RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong\npre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring\n5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to\ncompetitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent\nin-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest\nlinear models.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"test-time training\" \"RWKV\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We\ntrain language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the\nstrongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them\non real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated Linear Attention\" \"test-time training\" \"RWKV\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations.

AGaLiTe uses a normalized exponential average with element-wise learned decay parameters to smoothly reduce the impact of past information, making it suitable for test-time adaptations.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Language Models Using Linear Attention\n\n- **AGaLiTe** also addresses memory optimization by using a low-rank approximation to reduce the space complexity of the recurrent state matrix. This approach replaces the full-rank matrix with a set of vectors, significantly reducing memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n- The **Longhorn** model, which is based on state space models, does not require a separately parameterized forget gate, reducing the number of parameters and improving memory efficiency. Longhorn's approach to state management and recurrence can be adapted to optimize memory usage in linear attention mechanisms.\n\n## RWKV Architecture Modifications for Improved Efficiency\n\n- The **RWKV** architecture, as described, maintains a state in a ratio form and updates it using two separate state space models (SSMs). Recent modifications to RWKV involve replacing the elementwise product with an outer product, making it more similar to linear attention variants. This change can improve efficiency and align better with GLA mechanisms.\n\n- **RWKV** also uses a trainable weight for controlling the forgetting mechanism, which can be optimized further to enhance efficiency and reduce computational complexity.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The **AGaLiTe** paper provides insights into hardware-efficient implementations by reducing the computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism. AGaLiTe achieves this through a highly parallelizable feature map and a context-independent inference cost, which is beneficial for hardware optimization.\n\n- The guide on **Advances in Deep Learning Efficiency** discusses various hardware and software optimizations, including the use of GPUs and efficient memory management, which can be applied to optimize attention mechanisms in language models.\n\n## State Compression and Management in Language Models\n\n- **Longhorn** and other state space models (SSMs) like **Mamba** and **HGRN2** provide robust state management techniques. Longhorn's approach to treating the SSM's recurrent update as solving online learning objectives can be particularly useful for state compression and efficient state management.\n\n- The **AGaLiTe** model's use of a low-rank approximation for the recurrent state matrix is a direct example of state compression, which can significantly reduce memory usage and improve overall efficiency.\n\n### Technical Feasibility and Performance Implications\n\n- **Integration with RWKV Concepts**: The RWKV architecture's elementwise recurrence and the use of outer products can be integrated with GLA mechanisms to enhance efficiency and reduce computational complexity.\n\n- **Linear Attention Implementation**: AGaLiTe's linear attention mechanism, which is highly parallelizable and has a context-independent inference cost, can be implemented efficiently in hardware.\n\n- **Memory Management Efficiency**: Techniques from Longhorn and AGaLiTe, such as using low-rank approximations and optimized state updates, can significantly improve memory management and reduce memory usage.\n\n- **Scalability for Long Sequences**: The use of linear attention mechanisms and state space models like Longhorn and RWKV can improve scalability for long sequences by reducing the computational complexity and memory requirements.\n\nBy combining these approaches, the researchers can develop a novel autoregressive language model that integrates GLA with test-time training, optimizes memory usage, and enhances hardware efficiency, ultimately leading to better performance and scalability.\n",

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training implementation\" \"state compression language models\" \"hardware optimization linear attention\"*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach.

Fine-tuning Language Models over Slow Networks using Activation Compression with Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training implementation\" \"state compression language models\" \"hardware optimization linear attention\"*\n\n*Jue Wang, Binhang Yuan, Luka Rimanic, Yongjun He, Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, Christopher R\u00e9, Ce Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes AC-SGD, a novel activation compression algorithm for communication-efficient pipeline parallelism training over slow networks, and shows that it can be combined with state-of-the-art gradient compression algorithms to enable end-to-end communication compression.\n\n**Abstract:** Communication compression is a crucial technique for modern distributed learning systems to alleviate their communication bottlenecks over slower networks. Despite recent intensive studies of gradient compression for data parallel-style training, compressing the activations for models trained with pipeline parallelism is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose AC-SGD, a novel activation compression algorithm for communication-efficient pipeline parallelism training over slow networks. Different from previous efforts in activation compression, instead of compressing activation values directly, AC-SGD compresses the changes of the activations. This allows us to show, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that one can still achieve $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives under activation compression, without making assumptions on gradient unbiasedness that do not hold for deep learning models with non-linear activation functions.We then show that AC-SGD can be optimized and implemented efficiently, without additional end-to-end runtime overhead.We evaluated AC-SGD to fine-tune language models with up to 1.5 billion parameters, compressing activations to 2-4 bits.AC-SGD provides up to 4.3X end-to-end speed-up in slower networks, without sacrificing model quality. Moreover, we also show that AC-SGD can be combined with state-of-the-art gradient compression algorithms to enable\"end-to-end communication compression: All communications between machines, including model gradients, forward activations, and backward gradients are compressed into lower precision.This provides up to 4.9X end-to-end speed-up, without sacrificing model quality.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code.

However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K).

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training implementation\" \"state compression language models\" \"hardware optimization linear attention\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention.

This approach involves training the model to correct its initial responses without external feedback, which is crucial for managing memory and state updates during test-time. The method includes two stages: an initial stage to teach the model to correct its second-attempt responses and a subsequent multi-turn RL stage to bias the model towards self-correction.\n\n## State Compression and Reduction Techniques\n\n- The work on efficient inference, training, and fine-tuning of protein language models highlights several state compression and reduction techniques. Techniques such as activation checkpointing and ZeroOffload/CPUAdam are used to reduce memory usage. Activation checkpointing involves recalculating intermediate states during the backward pass instead of storing them, which trades runtime for memory savings. ZeroOffload/CPUAdam offloads optimization states to CPU memory, saving significant memory during training.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Implementations of Linear Attention\n\n- The implementation of Flash-Attention and Partition-Attention in protein language models demonstrates hardware-optimized linear attention mechanisms. Flash-Attention reduces model runtime by minimizing read/write operations between HBM and SRAM and fusing operations to reduce memory overhead. This results in substantial reductions in both inference and training time, as well as memory usage. Partition-Attention enables efficient handling of proteins with highly diverse lengths, extending batch sizes and reducing memory usage.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Architectural Components\n\n- The concept of hybrid architectures, as discussed in \"Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures,\" shows promise in combining different architectural components. This involves using specialized layers via a hybrid topology, which can balance the trade-off between model state size and recall ability. Integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with test-time training, as suggested by the FastTTTLinear proposal, requires careful consideration of state management and memory optimization techniques to preserve model expressiveness.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks\n\n- The performance metrics for memory-efficient language models include runtime, memory usage, and the ability to handle long sequences efficiently. For example, the use of Flash-Attention and Partition-Attention resulted in up to a 16-fold reduction in inference time and an 8-fold reduction in memory usage. These models were benchmarked on tasks such as missense variant effect prediction and protein properties prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational resources.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Inference Scaling Laws**: The paper on \"Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation\" introduces strategies like Demonstration-based RAG (DRAG) and iterative DRAG, which scale inference computation for long-context language models. This involves optimizing the allocation of test-time compute resources, such as the number of retrieved documents and generation steps, leading to significant performance gains.\n\n- **Memory-Computation Trade-off**: Efficient linear attention mechanisms, such as those discussed in \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training,\" trade off memory movement against parallelizability, which is crucial for balancing computational efficiency with memory management[Reference 1 from Future Search Plan].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory usage, computational resources, and overall performance, especially during test-time training and inference.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/25 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nVaswani, A., Shazeer, N., Parmar, N., Uszkoreit, J., Jones, L., Gomez, A.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster. Notably, our work considers models with tens of billions of parameters, which is up to $100\\times$ larger than what has been previously considered in the structured pruning literature.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Reconsidering the Past: Optimizing Hidden States in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Davis Yoshida, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hidden-State Optimization is presented, a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time that computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Hidden-State Optimization (HSO), a gradient-based method for improving the performance of transformer language models at inference time. Similar to dynamic evaluation (Krause et al., 2018), HSO computes the gradient of the log-probability the language model assigns to an evaluation text, but uses it to update the cached hidden states rather than the model parameters. We test HSO with pretrained Transformer-XL and GPT-2 language models, finding improvement on the WikiText103 and PG-19 datasets in terms of perplexity, especially when evaluating a model outside of its training distribution. We also demonstrate downstream applicability by showing gains in the recently developed prompt-based few-shot evaluation setting, again with no extra parameters or training data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Modular and On-demand Bias Mitigation with Attribute-Removal Subnetworks\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Lukas Hauzenberger, Shahed Masoudian, Deepak Kumar, M. Schedl, Navid Rekabsaz*\n\n**TL;DR:** The approach draws from the concept of \\emph{diff} pruning, and proposes a novel training regime adaptable to various representation disentanglement optimizations, which improves (or at least remains on-par with) the effectiveness of bias mitigation in comparison with baseline finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Societal biases are reflected in large pre-trained language models and their fine-tuned versions on downstream tasks. Common in-processing bias mitigation approaches, such as adversarial training and mutual information removal, introduce additional optimization criteria, and update the model to reach a new debiased state. However, in practice, end-users and practitioners might prefer to switch back to the original model, or apply debiasing only on a specific subset of protected attributes. To enable this, we propose a novel modular bias mitigation approach, consisting of stand-alone highly sparse debiasing subnetworks, where each debiasing module can be integrated into the core model on-demand at inference time. Our approach draws from the concept of \\emph{diff} pruning, and proposes a novel training regime adaptable to various representation disentanglement optimizations. We conduct experiments on three classification tasks with gender, race, and age as protected attributes. The results show that our modular approach, while maintaining task performance, improves (or at least remains on-par with) the effectiveness of bias mitigation in comparison with baseline finetuning. Particularly on a two-attribute dataset, our approach with separately learned debiasing subnetworks shows effective utilization of either or both the subnetworks for selective bias mitigation.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. A Computationally Efficient Sparsified Online Newton Method\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Fnu Devvrit, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Rohan Anil, Vineet Gupta, Cho-Jui Hsieh, I. Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method is introduced, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner that is as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order methods hold significant promise for enhancing the convergence of deep neural network training; however, their large memory and computational demands have limited their practicality. Thus there is a need for scalable second-order methods that can efficiently train large models. In this paper, we introduce the Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner. The algorithm emerges from a novel use of the LogDet matrix divergence measure; we combine it with sparsity constraints to minimize regret in the online convex optimization framework. Empirically, we test our method on large scale benchmarks of up to 1B parameters. We achieve up to 30% faster convergence, 3.4% relative improvement in validation performance, and 80% relative improvement in training loss, in comparison to memory efficient optimizers including first order methods. Powering the method is a surprising fact -- imposing structured sparsity patterns, like tridiagonal and banded structure, requires little to no overhead, making it as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods. In wall-clock time, tridiagonal SONew is only about 3% slower per step than first-order methods but gives overall gains due to much faster convergence. In contrast, one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) memory-intensive second-order methods, Shampoo, is unable to scale to large benchmarks. Additionally, while Shampoo necessitates significant engineering efforts to scale to large benchmarks, SONew offers a more straightforward implementation, increasing its practical appeal.

Despite being relatively new (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), NMT has already shown promising results, achieving state-of-the-art performances for various language pairs (Luong et al, 2015a; Jean et al, 2015; Luong et al, 2015b; Sennrich et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016). While many of these NMT papers were presented to the ACL community, research and practice of NMT are only at their beginning stage. This tutorial would be a great opportunity for the whole community of machine translation and natural language processing to learn more about a very promising new approach to MT. This tutorial has four parts. In the first part, we start with an overview of MT approaches, including: (a) traditional methods that have been dominant over the past twenty years and (b) recent hybrid models with the use of neural network components. From these, we motivate why an end-to-end approach like neural machine translation is needed. The second part introduces a basic instance of NMT. We start out with a discussion of recurrent neural networks, including the back-propagation-through-time algorithm and stochastic gradient descent optimizers, as these are the foundation on which NMT builds. We then describe in detail the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture of NMT (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), the maximum likelihood training approach, and a simple beam-search decoder to produce translations. The third part of our tutorial describes techniques to build state-of-the-art NMT. We start with approaches to extend the vocabulary coverage of NMT (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015; Chitnis and DeNero, 2015). We then introduce the idea of jointly learning both translations and alignments through an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015); other variants of attention (Luong et al., 2015b; Tu et al., 2016) are discussed too. We describe a recent trend in NMT, that is to translate at the sub-word level (Chung et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016), so that language variations can be effectively handled. We then give tips on training and testing NMT systems such as batching and ensembling. In the final part of the tutorial, we briefly describe promising approaches, such as (a) how to combine multiple tasks to help translation (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2016; Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016) and (b) how to utilize monolingual corpora (Sennrich et al., 2016). Lastly, we conclude with challenges remained to be solved for future NMT. PS: we would also like to acknowledge the very first paper by Forcada and \u00d1eco (1997) on sequence-to-sequence models for translation!\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Yara Shamshoum, Nitzan Hodos, Yuval Sieradzki, Assaf Schuster*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce CompAct, a technique that reduces peak memory utilization on GPU\nby 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning of LLMs. Peak device memory\nis a major limiting factor in training LLMs, with various recent works aiming\nto reduce model memory. However most works don't target the largest component\nof allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored\nfor the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used\nin the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous\nmethods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained\nparameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding\nadditional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either\npretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing\ncompute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher\nfor larger models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-20T10:24:38Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-20T10:24:38Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Fine Line: Navigating Large Language Model Pretraining with\n  Down-streaming Capability Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training optimization\" \"GLA state compression\" \"performance comparison language models\"*\n\n*Chen Yang, Junzhuo Li, Xinyao Niu, Xinrun Du, Songyang Gao, Haoran Zhang, Zhaoliang Chen, Xingwei Qu, Ruibin Yuan, Yizhi Li, Jiaheng Liu, Stephen W. Huang, Shawn Yue, Jie Fu, Ge Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Uncovering early-stage metrics that reflect final model performance is one\ncore principle for large-scale pretraining. The existing scaling law\ndemonstrates the power-law correlation between pretraining loss and training\nflops, which serves as an important indicator of the current training state for\nlarge language models. However, this principle only focuses on the model's\ncompression properties on the training data, resulting in an inconsistency with\nthe ability improvements on the downstream tasks. Some follow-up works\nattempted to extend the scaling-law to more complex metrics (such as\nhyperparameters), but still lacked a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic\ndifferences among various capabilities during pretraining. To address the\naforementioned limitations, this paper undertakes a comprehensive comparison of\nmodel capabilities at various pretraining intermediate checkpoints. Through\nthis analysis, we confirm that specific downstream metrics exhibit similar\ntraining dynamics across models of different sizes, up to 67 billion\nparameters. In addition to our core findings, we've reproduced Amber and\nOpenLLaMA, releasing their intermediate checkpoints. This initiative offers\nvaluable resources to the research community and facilitates the verification\nand exploration of LLM pretraining by open-source researchers. Besides, we\nprovide empirical summaries, including performance comparisons of different\nmodels and capabilities, and tuition of key metrics for different training\nphases. Based on these findings, we provide a more user-friendly strategy for\nevaluating the optimization state, offering guidance for establishing a stable\npretraining process.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-01T16:00:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-25T07:59:49Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on test-time training optimization, combining Gated Linear Attention (GLA) with state compression, and other relevant optimization strategies, here are some key points and methods derived from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Test-Time Training Optimization Techniques\n\n### Adaptive Test-Time Computation\n- The paper on scaling test-time computation in LLMs highlights the importance of adaptively allocating test-time compute based on the prompt difficulty. It proposes using a \"compute-optimal\" strategy, which can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling significantly. This involves methods like searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models and updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively at test time.\n\n### Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) and Test-Time Training (TTT)\n- TTA methods, such as MITA, focus on mutual adaptation of the model and data at test time. This approach uses energy-based optimization to align the model's distribution with the test data, improving generalizability to out-of-distribution data.\n- TTT methods involve fine-tuning the model at test time using self-supervised or unsupervised objectives. This can include updating BatchNorm statistics, minimizing prediction entropy, or using auxiliary heads for self-supervised learning. These methods are particularly effective for adapting to unseen data and improving performance on out-of-distribution test data.\n\n## Combining GLA with State Compression\n\n### State Management and Compression\n- GLA Transformers can be optimized by combining linear attention with data-dependent gates, which helps in managing memory efficiently. This approach allows for better length generalization and state management[References: Yang et al., 2023].\n- State compression techniques, such as those used in BASED, which combines linear and sliding window attention, can help in dialing the state size and traversing the pareto frontier of memory and computation trade-offs[References: Arora et al., 2024].\n\n### Hybrid Approaches\n- Hybrid models that integrate GLA with other attention mechanisms and state management techniques, like DenseSSM, can retain fine-grained information crucial for the final output. This selective integration of shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers improves information flow and model expressiveness[References: He et al., 2024].\n\n## Comparative Analysis of Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Performance Metrics\n- The performance of different attention mechanisms, such as GLA, softmax attention, and hybrid approaches, can be compared based on metrics like perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs. GLA Transformers are especially effective at length generalization but may underperform softmax attention in certain scenarios unless optimized with data-dependent gates[References: Yang et al., 2023].\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms\n- IO-aware algorithms can significantly improve throughput on language generation tasks by optimizing memory movement against parallelizability. This is crucial for practical efficiency in large language models[References: Arora et al., 2024].\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Training\n- Hardware-efficient training methods, such as those described for GLA Transformers, focus on balancing memory and computation. These methods trade off memory movement against parallelizability, ensuring efficient training and inference[References: Yang et al., 2023].\n\n## Integration Approaches for Combining Multiple Optimization Techniques\n\n### Unified Frameworks\n- Combining test-time training with GLA and state compression requires a unified framework that manages state efficiently while adapting to test data. This can involve integrating TTA or TTT methods with GLA and state compression techniques to ensure that the model remains expressive and efficient.\n\n### Adaptive State Management\n- Adaptive state management strategies, such as those in MITA, can be integrated with GLA to ensure that the model adapts to the test data distribution while maintaining computational efficiency. This involves using energy-based optimization and dynamic self-update mechanisms to align the model and data distributions.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are optimized for test-time performance, efficient in terms of computation and memory, and scalable to larger models and datasets.\n",
