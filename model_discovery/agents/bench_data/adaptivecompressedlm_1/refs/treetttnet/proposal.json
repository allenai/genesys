Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.66)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time, and TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[^6]| Configuration | Ppl. | Diff. |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Linear attention [41] | 15.91 | - |\n| Linear attn. improved | 15.23 | -0.68 |\n| TTT equivalence | 15.23 | 0 |\n| + learnable $W_{0}$ | 15.27 | +0.04 |\n| + LN and residual in $f$ | 14.05 | -1.22 |\n| + mini-batch TTT | 12.35 | -1.70 |\n| + learnable $\\eta$ | 11.99 | -0.36 |\n| + Mamba backbone | 11.09 | -0.90 |\n\nTable 1. Ablations on improving from linear attention. All models here have 125 M parameters, and are trained according to the recipe in Subsection 3.1. The last row, with perplexity 11.09 , is the final result of TTT-Linear in Figure 11. Starting from the equivalence discussed in Subsection 2.6, learnable $W_{0}$ hurts slightly, but the rows below cannot train stably without it. The biggest improvement comes from mini-batch TTT (changing from $b=T=2048$ to $b=16$ ). The second comes from instantiating the inner model $f$ with LN and residual connection. Both of these designs would be difficult to come across without the conceptual framework of TTT. Under this new definition of TTT layers, both parametric learners such as that in Theorem 1 and nonparametric learners such as that in Theorem 2 can be included. Figure 10 summarizes this general definition of TTT layers in the broader scope of all sequence modeling layers. This general definition has an additional benefit for parametric learners: There can be more objects other than $W$ in the internal storage of parametric learners, such as the optimizer state, which will also be included in the hidden state of the induced TTT layer. This extension allows TTT layers to use more sophisticated optimizers such as Adam [42] in future work. ### 2.7 Implementation details\n\nInstantiations of $f$. We propose two variants of TTT layers - TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, differing only in their instantiations of $f$. For TTT-Linear, $f_{\\mathrm{lin}}(x)=W x$, where $W$ is square. For TTT-MLP, $f_{\\text {MLP }}$ has two layers similar to the MLPs in Transformers. Specifically, the hidden dimension is $4 \\times$ the input dimension, followed by a GELU activation [31]. For better stability during TTT, $f$ always contains a Layer Normalization (LN) and residual connection. That is, $f(x)=x+\\operatorname{LN}\\left(f_{\\text {res }}(x)\\right)$, where $f_{\\text {res }}$ can be $f_{\\text {lin }}$ or $f_{\\text {MLP }}$. Learnable $W_{0}$. The TTT initialization $W_{0}$ is shared between all sequences, even though subsequent weights $W_{1}, \\ldots, W_{T}$ are different for each input sequence. Instead of setting $W_{0}=0$, we can learn it as part of the outer loop. Since outer-loop parameters are always denoted by $\\theta$ s instead of $W \\mathrm{~s}$, we assign an alias $\\theta_{\\text {init }}=W_{0}$. In practice, $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ adds a negligible amount of parameters comparing to the reconstruction views $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$, because both its input and output are low dimensional.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/51 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\n[^5]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-11.jpg?height=405&width=831&top_left_y=237&top_left_x=300)\n\nFigure 10. RNN layers and TTT layers are both subsets of sequence modeling layers. RNN layers have a hidden state that is fixed in size across time. TTT layers with parametric learners are also RNN layers, since their hidden state is also fixed in size. TTT layers with nonparametric learners can represent self-attention, as discussed in Subsection 2.6. In Table 1, we first empirically verify the equivalence above with an improved implementation of linear attention. ${ }^{8}$ Then, to illustrate the contribution of each of our components (including some that will be introduced in the next subsection), we add them row by row to the TTT layer that is equivalent to linear attention, and ultimately obtain our proposed instantiation called TTT-Linear. The change from batch GD to mini-batch GD contributes the most improvement by a large margin. While the space of models $\\times$ optimizers in Figure 9 is already large, machine learning is much richer than optimizing the parameters $W_{t}$ of a model $f$. There are also nonparametric learners, such as nearest neighbors, support vector machines (SVMs), and kernel ridge regression. By definition, nonparametric learners do not have parameters $W_{t}$, and instead directly uses training data $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. Hence we use the notation $f\\left(x ; x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}\\right)$. We now show that for a particular nonparametric learner, the induced TTT layer is equivalent to self-attention. Theorem 2. Consider the TTT layer with the Nadaraya-Watson estimator [7, 12], defined as:\n\n$$\nf\\left(x ; x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}\\right)=\\frac{1}{\\sum_{s=1}^{t} \\kappa\\left(x, x_{s}\\right)} \\sum_{s=1}^{t} \\kappa\\left(x, x_{s}\\right) y_{s}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{s}=\\theta_{V} x_{s}$ is the label view discussed in Subsection 2.3, and\n\n$$\n\\kappa\\left(x, x^{\\prime} ; \\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}\\right) \\propto e^{\\left(\\theta_{K} x\\right)^{T} \\theta_{Q} x^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nis a kernel with bandwidth hyper-parameters $\\theta_{K}$ and $\\theta_{Q}$. Then given the same input sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$, the output rule defined in Equation 5 produces the same output sequence $z_{1}, \\ldots, z_{T}$ as self-attention. Proof. Plugging $y_{s}$ and $\\kappa$ above into Equation 9 gives us the definition of self-attention. Appendix B contains a detailed explanation of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator and kernel $\\kappa$ above. In contrast to Theorem 1, Theorem 2 does not produce a different implementation from attention. For the TTT layer above, the hidden state is $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$ or a similar list of processed training data, the update rule adds $x_{t}$ to the list, and the output rule scans the list with $\\kappa$. In previous subsections, our hidden state has been defined as $W_{t}$, the update rule a gradient step, and the output rule a call to $f$. To unify these two constructions, we define a new abstraction called a learner, which uniquely induces a TTT layer. Similar to its definition in standard machine learning packages [54], all learners need to implement two methods: train and predict. Now we redefine the hidden state of the induced TTT layer as the internal storage of the learner, and the update and output rules as the train and predict methods.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention efficient long sequence\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, these models, predominantly based on transformers, are difficult to scale to long documents as their attention layers have quadratic complexity in the sequence length. Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias. We evaluate the model on IWSLT 2015 and OpenSubtitles 2018 against the transformer, demonstrating substantially increased decoding speed on long sequences with similar or better BLEU scores. We show that sentential gating further improves translation quality on IWSLT.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Sequence Parallelism: Long Sequence Training from System Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Shenggui Li, Fuzhao Xue, Yongbin Li, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes sequence parallelism, a memory-efficient parallelism that is compatible with most existing parallelisms, which means it makes 4D parallelism possible and no longer requires a single device to hold the whole sequence.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer achieves promising results on various tasks. However, self-attention suffers from quadratic memory requirements with respect to the sequence length. Existing work focuses on reducing time and space complexity from an algorithm perspective. In this work, we propose sequence parallelism, a memory-efficient parallelism to solve this issue from system perspective instead. Our approach is compatible with most existing parallelisms (e.g., data, pipeline, and tensor parallelism), which means our sequence parallelism makes 4D parallelism possible. More importantly, we no longer require a single device to hold the whole sequence. Besides, using efficient attention with linear complexity, our sequence parallelism enables us to train transformer with infinite long sequence. Specifically, we split the input sequence into multiple chunks and feed each chunk into its corresponding device (i.e., GPU). To compute the attention output, we integrated ring-style communication with self-attention calculation and proposed Ring Self-Attention (RSA). Experiments show that sequence parallelism performs well when scaling with batch size and sequence length. Compared with tensor parallelism, our approach achieved 13.7\\times and 3.0\\times maximum batch size and sequence length respectively when scaling up to 64 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. With efficient attention, sequence can handle sequence with over 114K tokens, which is over 27\\times longer than existing efficient attention works holding the whole sequence on a single device.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. FMMformer: Efficient and Flexible Transformer via Decomposed Near-field and Far-field Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*T. Nguyen, Vai Suliafu, S. Osher, Long Chen, Bao Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** FMMformers is a class of efficient and flexible transformers inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method for accelerating interacting particle simulation that can even outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant margin.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose FMMformers, a class of efficient and flexible transformers inspired by the celebrated fast multipole method (FMM) for accelerating interacting particle simulation. FMM decomposes particle-particle interaction into near-field and far-field components and then performs direct and coarse-grained computation, respectively. Similarly, FMMformers decompose the attention into near-field and far-field attention, modeling the near-field attention by a banded matrix and the far-field attention by a low-rank matrix. Computing the attention matrix for FMMformers requires linear complexity in computational time and memory footprint with respect to the sequence length. In contrast, standard transformers suffer from quadratic complexity. We analyze and validate the advantage of FMMformers over the standard transformer on the Long Range Arena and language modeling benchmarks. FMMformers can even outperform the standard transformer in terms of accuracy by a significant margin. For instance, FMMformers achieve an average classification accuracy of $60.74\\%$ over the five Long Range Arena tasks, which is significantly better than the standard transformer's average accuracy of $58.70\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. FNet: Mixing Tokens with Fourier Transforms\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Santiago Ontanon, Ilya Eckstein, Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We show that Transformer encoder architectures can be sped up, with limited accuracy costs, by replacing the self-attention sublayers with simple linear transformations that \"mix\" input tokens. These linear mixers, along with standard nonlinearities in feed-forward layers, prove competent at modeling semantic relationships in several text classification tasks. Most surprisingly, we find that replacing the self-attention sublayer in a Transformer encoder with a standard, unparameterized Fourier Transform achieves 92-97% of the accuracy of BERT counterparts on the GLUE benchmark, but trains 80% faster on GPUs and 70% faster on TPUs at standard 512 input lengths. At longer input lengths, our FNet model is significantly faster: when compared to the \"efficient\" Transformers on the Long Range Arena benchmark, FNet matches the accuracy of the most accurate models, while outpacing the fastest models across all sequence lengths on GPUs (and across relatively shorter lengths on TPUs). Finally, FNet has a light memory footprint and is particularly efficient at smaller model sizes; for a fixed speed and accuracy budget, small FNet models outperform Transformer counterparts.\n\n**Proceeding:** naacl-2022-7\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention efficient long sequence*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on linear attention mechanisms, efficient sequence processing, and state-space models, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- The **Local Attention Mechanism (LAM)** proposed in is designed to reduce computational and memory complexity by only computing dot products on nearby inputs. This approach can be implemented efficiently in tensor algebra, leading to almost linear time and memory complexity, which is crucial for handling long sequences.\n- **Longformer** and similar models combine local windowed attention with global attention to balance efficiency and effectiveness. This approach scales linearly with sequence length, addressing the quadratic scaling issue of traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n### Attention Biases and Positional Encoding\n- **ALiBi** introduces a method where positional embeddings are not added to word embeddings; instead, query-key attention scores are biased with a penalty proportional to their distance. This enables better extrapolation to longer sequences than seen during training, which can be beneficial for linear attention mechanisms.\n\n## Efficient Sequence Processing\n\n### Sparse and Block Attention\n- **Sparse Attention** mechanisms, such as those discussed in, limit the number of tokens that each token attends to, reducing computational costs while maintaining performance. This can be particularly useful for long sequences.\n- **Block-Attention** divides retrieved documents into discrete blocks, allowing for the reuse of key-value states of passages that have been seen before. This significantly reduces latency and computational overhead during inference, which could be adapted for sequence processing in language models.\n\n### Additive Linear Recurrence\n- The concept of **additive linear recurrence** from **LightNet** can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan, providing an efficient alternative to multiplicative linear recurrence. This could be applied to improve the efficiency of sequence processing in language models.\n\n## State Management and State Space Models\n\n### Hybrid Memory Approaches\n- **Hybrid State Space Realizations** like B'MOJO combine eidetic and fading memory, offering a potential solution for balancing memory efficiency with information retention. This hybrid approach could be integrated into language models to manage long-term dependencies more effectively.\n\n### Adaptive Memory Mechanisms\n- Adaptive memory mechanisms based on input importance can help in efficient state updates and memory usage. This involves dynamically allocating memory resources based on the relevance of the input data, which can be particularly beneficial for handling long sequences and complex dependencies.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency and Parallelization\n\n### Optimizing for Modern Hardware\n- Ensuring that the model's architecture is optimized for modern hardware can significantly improve performance. This includes optimizing memory access patterns and computational efficiency, as well as employing better parallelization strategies.\n\n### Parallel Processing\n- Self-attention mechanisms, as discussed in and, allow for parallel processing of input data, which can significantly speed up training times. This is a key advantage of transformer-based models over traditional sequence models like LSTMs.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo improve the autoregressive language model design, the following strategies can be considered:\n\n- **Implementing Local or Block Attention**: Mechanisms like LAM or Block-Attention can reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency for long sequences.\n- **Using Sparse Attention**: Limiting the number of tokens each token attends to can reduce computational costs.\n- **Adopting Additive Linear Recurrence**: This can provide more efficient sequence processing compared to traditional multiplicative approaches.\n- **Hybrid State Space Models**: Combining eidetic and fading memory can help in managing long-term dependencies and improving memory efficiency.\n- **Optimizing for Hardware**: Ensuring the model is optimized for modern hardware and leveraging parallel processing can enhance overall performance.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/51 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\n## Summary of contributions. 1. We propose TTT layers, a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is self-supervised learning. Our perspective that the forward pass of a layer contains a training loop itself opens up a new direction for future research. 2. TTT-Linear, one simple instantiation of TTT layers, outperforms Transformers and Mamba in our evaluations ranging from 125 M to 1.3 B parameters. 3. We improve the hardware efficiency of TTT layers through mini-batch TTT and the dual form, making TTT-Linear already a practical building block for LLMs. ## 2 Method\n\nAll sequence modeling layers can be viewed from the perspective of storing historic context into a hidden state, as shown in Figure $4 .{ }^{1}$ For example, RNN layers - such as LSTM [33], RWKV [56] and Mamba [26] layers - compress context into a state of fixed size across time.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/51 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nThis result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8 k . On the other hand, once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of the extra information being conditioned on. The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention, RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,\nthe update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We introduce two simple instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention. Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already efficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical innovations to make it efficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than $5 \\times$ faster. As shown in Figure 3, TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8 k context and matches Mamba. Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following the Chinchilla recipe [34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.33)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection. By leveraging a combination of graph neural networks and recurrent structures, REST efficiently captures both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies within EEG data. Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task. These attributes position REST as a promising candidate for real-time implementation in clinical devices, such as Responsive Neurostimulation or seizure alert systems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanism memory compression*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. MEFT: Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning through Sparse Adapter\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanism memory compression*\n\n*Jitai Hao, Weiwei Sun, Xin Xin, Qi Meng, Zhumin Chen, Pengjie Ren, Zhaochun Ren*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel mechanism that fine-tunes LLMs with adapters of larger size yet memory-efficient by leveraging the inherent activation sparsity in the Feed-Forward Networks of LLMs and utilizing the larger capacity of Central Processing Unit (CPU) memory compared to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) facilitates the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) under limited resources. However, the fine-tuning performance with PEFT on complex, knowledge-intensive tasks is limited due to the constrained model capacity, which originates from the limited number of additional trainable parameters. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel mechanism that fine-tunes LLMs with adapters of larger size yet memory-efficient. This is achieved by leveraging the inherent activation sparsity in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) of LLMs and utilizing the larger capacity of Central Processing Unit (CPU) memory compared to Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). We store and update the parameters of larger adapters on the CPU. Moreover, we employ a Mixture of Experts (MoE)-like architecture to mitigate unnecessary CPU computations and reduce the communication volume between the GPU and CPU. This is particularly beneficial over the limited bandwidth of PCI Express (PCIe). Our method can achieve fine-tuning results comparable to those obtained with larger memory capacities, even when operating under more limited resources such as a 24GB memory single GPU setup, with acceptable loss in training efficiency.

Efficient Dialogue State Tracking by Selectively Overwriting Memory\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanism memory compression*\n\n*Sungdong Kim, Sohee Yang, Gyuwan Kim, Sang-Woo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** The accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations are analyzed and it is suggested that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works in dialogue state tracking (DST) focus on an open vocabulary-based setting to resolve scalability and generalization issues of the predefined ontology-based approaches. However, they are inefficient in that they predict the dialogue state at every turn from scratch. Here, we consider dialogue state as an explicit fixed-sized memory and propose a selectively overwriting mechanism for more efficient DST. This mechanism consists of two steps: (1) predicting state operation on each of the memory slots, and (2) overwriting the memory with new values, of which only a few are generated according to the predicted state operations. Our method decomposes DST into two sub-tasks and guides the decoder to focus only on one of the tasks, thus reducing the burden of the decoder. This enhances the effectiveness of training and DST performance. Our SOM-DST (Selectively Overwriting Memory for Dialogue State Tracking) model achieves state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy with 51.72% in MultiWOZ 2.0 and 53.01% in MultiWOZ 2.1 in an open vocabulary-based DST setting. In addition, we analyze the accuracy gaps between the current and the ground truth-given situations and suggest that it is a promising direction to improve state operation prediction to boost the DST performance.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 49*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanism memory compression*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Ionut-Vlad Modoranu, Mher Safaryan, Thomas Robert*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce LDAdam, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large models, that performs adaptive optimization steps within lower dimensional subspaces, while consistently exploring the full parameter space during training. This strategy keeps the optimizer's memory footprint to a fraction of the model size. LDAdam relies on a new projection-aware update rule for the optimizer states that allows for transitioning between subspaces, i.e., estimation of the statistics of the projected gradients. To mitigate the errors due to low-rank projection, LDAdam integrates a new generalized error feedback mechanism, which explicitly accounts for both gradient and optimizer state compression. We prove the convergence of LDAdam under standard assumptions, and show that LDAdam allows for accurate and efficient fine-tuning and pre-training of language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21\n\n\n\n\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time, and TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/51 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nThis result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8 k . On the other hand, once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of the extra information being conditioned on. The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention, RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,\nthe update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We introduce two simple instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention. Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already efficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical innovations to make it efficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than $5 \\times$ faster. As shown in Figure 3, TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8 k context and matches Mamba. Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following the Chinchilla recipe [34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/51 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nHere we have designed all views as linear projections for simplicity. Future work might experiment with more flexible transformations, or bigger and different families of self-supervised tasks. ### 2.4 Parallelization with mini-batch TTT\n\nThe naive TTT layer developed so far is already efficient in the number of floating point operations (FLOPs). However, its update rule $W_{t}=W_{t-1}-\\eta \\nabla l\\left(W_{t-1} ; x_{t}\\right)$ cannot be parallelized, because $W_{t}$ depends on $W_{t-1}$ in two places: before the minus sign and inside $\\nabla l$. Since $\\nabla l$ contains the bulk of the computation, we focus on making this second part parallel. We approach this systems challenge through concepts in the TTT framework. There are many variants of gradient descent (GD). The general update rule of GD can be expressed as:\n\n$$\nW_{t}=W_{t-1}-\\eta G_{t}=W_{0}-\\eta \\sum_{s=1}^{t} G_{s}\n$$\n\nwhere $G_{t}$ is the descent direction. Note that once we have calculated $G_{t}$ for $t=1, \\ldots, T$, we can then obtain all the $W_{t} s$ through a cumsum by the second half of Equation 6. Our naive update rule, known as online gradient descent, uses $G_{t}=\\nabla l\\left(W_{t-1} ; x_{t}\\right)$.

The cleanest way to integrate any RNN layer into a larger architecture would be to directly replace self-attention in a Transformer, known in this context as a backbone. However, existing RNNs such as Mamba [26] and Griffin [18] all use a different backbone from Transformers. Most notably, their backbone contains temporal convolutions before the RNN layers, which might help collect local information across time. After experimenting with the Mamba backbone, we find that it also improves perplexity for TTT layers, so we incorporate it into our proposed method. See Figure 16 (in Appendix) for details. ## 3 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP by comparing with two baselines - Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Our main codebase is based on EasyLM [25], an open-source project for training and serving LLMs in JAX.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Fine- and Coarse-Granularity Hybrid Self-Attention for Efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Jing Zhao, Yifan Wang, Junwei Bao, Youzheng Wu, Xiaodong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** FC is proposed, a fine- and coarse-granularity hybrid self-attention that reduces the computation cost through progressively shortening the computational sequence length in self-Attention and offers a significantly better trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs compared to prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based pre-trained models, such as BERT, have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, deploying these models can be prohibitively costly, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer suffers from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length. To confront this, we propose FCA, a fine- and coarse-granularity hybrid self-attention that reduces the computation cost through progressively shortening the computational sequence length in self-attention. Specifically, FCA conducts an attention-based scoring strategy to determine the informativeness of tokens at each layer. Then, the informative tokens serve as the fine-granularity computing units in self-attention and the uninformative tokens are replaced with one or several clusters as the coarse-granularity computing units in self-attention. Experiments on the standard GLUE benchmark show that BERT with FCA achieves 2x reduction in FLOPs over original BERT with <1% loss in accuracy. We show that FCA offers a significantly better trade-off between accuracy and FLOPs compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Communication-Efficient Federated Hypergradient Computation via Aggregated Iterative Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Peiyao Xiao, Kaiyi Ji*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD), which achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated bilevel optimization has attracted increasing attention due to emerging machine learning and communication applications. The biggest challenge lies in computing the gradient of the upper-level objective function (i.e., hypergradient) in the federated setting due to the nonlinear and distributed construction of a series of global Hessian matrices. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via aggregated iterative differentiation (AggITD). AggITD is simple to implement and significantly reduces the communication cost by conducting the federated hypergradient estimation and the lower-level optimization simultaneously. We show that the proposed AggITD-based algorithm achieves the same sample complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data heterogeneity. Our results also shed light on the great advantage of ITD over AID in the federated/distributed hypergradient estimation. This differs from the comparison in the non-distributed bilevel optimization, where ITD is less efficient than AID. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the great effectiveness and communication efficiency of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. TokenMixup: Efficient Attention-guided Token-level Data Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid attention mechanism efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Hyeong Kyu Choi, Joonmyung Choi, Hyunwoo J. Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** TokenMixup is proposed, an efficient attention-guided token-level data augmentation method that aims to maximize the saliency of a mixed set of tokens and provides x15 faster saliency-awareData augmentation compared to gradient-based methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixup is a commonly adopted data augmentation technique for image classification. Recent advances in mixup methods primarily focus on mixing based on saliency. However, many saliency detectors require intense computation and are especially burdensome for parameter-heavy transformer models. To this end, we propose TokenMixup, an efficient attention-guided token-level data augmentation method that aims to maximize the saliency of a mixed set of tokens. TokenMixup provides x15 faster saliency-aware data augmentation compared to gradient-based methods. Moreover, we introduce a variant of TokenMixup which mixes tokens within a single instance, thereby enabling multi-scale feature augmentation. Experiments show that our methods significantly improve the baseline models' performance on CIFAR and ImageNet-1K, while being more efficient than previous methods. We also reach state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100 among from-scratch transformer models.

For instance, the Hybrid Attention Separable Block (HASB) described in combines channel attention and spatial attention. This approach can be modified for language models by focusing on different dimensions of the input data. Channel attention can prioritize certain features or embeddings, while spatial attention (or in this context, sequence attention) can emphasize specific positions in the sequence.\n\n### PETAH: Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation\nThe PETAH framework for hybrid transformers, as outlined in, adapts both attention layers and convolutional layers in a parameter-efficient manner. This approach can be translated to language models by adapting not only the attention layers but also other components like feed-forward networks. This ensures that the model remains efficient while maintaining performance.\n\n## Efficient Gradient Computation\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe use of memristor-based accelerators for transformer self-attention, as described in, can significantly reduce the computational complexity of gradient computations. By integrating computation into memory using memristor crossbar arrays, this method can accelerate matrix operations involved in attention mechanisms, which are crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n### Lower-Dimensional Optimization\nThe LDAdam approach mentioned in the analysis note, which performs adaptive optimization steps within lower-dimensional subspaces, can be highly effective in reducing the memory footprint and computational overhead of gradient updates.\n\n### Constant Memory Attention Blocks\nThe Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB) concept, which ensures constant memory usage and computation updates, can be adapted for language models to improve efficiency. This approach is particularly useful for models that need to process long sequences without significant memory increases.\n\n## Combining Multiple Efficiency Techniques\n\n### Hybrid CPU-GPU Memory Strategies\nCombining CPU and GPU memory strategies, as suggested in the MEFT approach, can help in managing memory efficiently. This hybrid approach can be integrated with other efficiency techniques to maximize the effective model capacity and reduce computational overhead.\n\n### Sparse Adapter Approaches\nUsing sparse adapter approaches, as mentioned in the MEFT and PETAH frameworks, can help in fine-tuning large language models efficiently. These methods can be combined with hybrid attention mechanisms and lower-dimensional optimization to achieve highly performant and storage-friendly models.\n\n### Quantization and Compression\nSub-4-bit quantization and other compression strategies can further reduce the memory footprint of the model. These techniques, when combined with efficient gradient computation methods and hybrid attention mechanisms, can significantly improve the overall efficiency of the autoregressive language model.\n\nBy integrating these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is not only efficient in terms of gradient computation but also scalable, robust, and highly performant. The combination of hybrid attention mechanisms, lower-dimensional optimization, constant memory attention blocks, and hybrid memory strategies can help achieve the desired goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n",

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.56)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/32 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n(2020b)). The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3. Performance of pixel-level classification on the sCIFAR. | Model | Accuracy (\\%) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Attention: |  |\n| Transformer (Trinh et al., 2018) | 62.20 |\n| $R N N:$ |  |\n| LSTM (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) | 63.01 |\n| r-LSTM (Trinh et al., 2018) | 72.20 |\n| UR-GRU (Gu et al., 2020b) | 74.40 |\n| HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020a) | 61.10 |\n| LipschitzRNN (Erichson et al., 2020) | 64.20 |\n| State Space Models: |  |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2022) | 91.80 |\n| S4D (Gu et al., 2022) | 90.69 |\n| S5 (Smith et al., 2023) | 90.10 |\n| Liquid-S4 (Hasani et al., 2022) | 92.02 |\n| Convolution: |  |\n| TrellisNet (Bai et al., 2018) | 73.42 |\n| CKConv (Li et al., 2022) | 63.74 |\n| FlexConv (Romero et al., 2021) | 80.82 |\n| MultiresNet (Shi et al., 2023) | $\\mathbf{9 3 . 1 5}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 2}$ |\n\nmodeling, presenting a significant challenge to models. It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4. Performance and training speed on WikiText-103 dataset. |  | WikiText-103 |  |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Model | \\#Param. | PPL | Speed |\n| Transformer-adaptive | 247 M | 18.66 | $5.6 \\mathrm{k} \\mathrm{t} / \\mathrm{s}$ |\n| Transformer-XL | 257 M | 18.30 | - |\n| S4(Gu et al., 2020b) | 249 M | 20.95 | - |\n| Mega-chunk(Ma et al., 2022) | 252 M | $\\underline{18.07}$ | 48 k t/s |\n| CHELA (ours) | 258 M | $\\mathbf{1 6 . 9 7}$ | 53 k t/s |\n\nTable 5.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hardware optimization tree attention token scoring\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization tree attention token scoring*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Gradient-Boosted Decision Tree for Listwise Context Model in Multimodal Review Helpfulness Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization tree attention token scoring*\n\n*Thong Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, A.

Previous studies commonly employ fully-connected neural networks (FCNNs) as the final score predictor and pairwise loss as the training objective. However, FCNNs have been shown to perform inefficient splitting for review features, making the model difficult to clearly differentiate helpful from unhelpful reviews. Furthermore, pairwise objective, which works on review pairs, may not completely capture the MRHP goal to produce the ranking for the entire review list, and possibly induces low generalization during testing. To address these issues, we propose a listwise attention network that clearly captures the MRHP ranking context and a listwise optimization objective that enhances model generalization. We further propose gradient-boosted decision tree as the score predictor to efficaciously partition product reviews' representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results and polished generalization performance on two large-scale MRHP benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work is the first to discover that attention sinks occur not only at the start of sequences but also within later tokens of the input, and not all attention sinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a fundamental component behind the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs). However, our current understanding of the attention mechanism, especially regarding how attention distributions are established, remains limited. Inspired by recent studies that explore the presence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives disproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic importance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a more profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and to uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly optimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning. Specifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the attention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and tasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of sequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention sinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon our findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT) that automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during inference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT consistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different applications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to 7.30% in accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B.

Though being effective, such methods rely on external dependency parsers, which can be unavailable for low-resource languages or perform worse in low-resource domains. In addition, dependency trees are also not optimized for aspect-based sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose an aspect-specific and language-agnostic discrete latent opinion tree model as an alternative structure to explicit dependency trees. To ease the learning of complicated structured latent variables, we build a connection between aspect-to-context attention scores and syntactic distances, inducing trees from the attention scores.

This method uses a speculative tree-search framework combined with Best-of-N (BoN) sampling. It reduces computational overhead by pruning low-quality responses and utilizes token-level rewards from Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide tree expansion. This hierarchical structure can be integrated with TTTLinear to reduce the complexity of attention computation from linear to nearly logarithmic, similar to the insights from \"Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees\"[Analysis Note #4].\n\n### Efficient Attention Computation\nThe \"RetrievalAttention\" method mentioned in uses dynamic sparse attention during token generation, which can be adapted for tree-based attention. This approach constructs a vector index tailored for the attention mechanism, focusing on the distribution of queries rather than key similarities. This allows for the traversal of only a small subset of key vectors, reducing latency and GPU memory utilization.\n\n## Efficient Token Scoring Mechanisms\n\n### Token-Level Rewards and Pruning\nThe \"TreeBoN\" method employs token-level rewards from DPO to guide the pruning of low-quality paths. This approach ensures that only promising candidates are expanded, which can be highly efficient in terms of computational resources. By using implicit DPO rewards, it enhances the reliability of partial-reward approximation, which is crucial for accurate token scoring.\n\n### Hybrid Granularity Approaches\nThe \"Fine- and Coarse-Granularity Hybrid Self-Attention\" approach [Analysis Note #4] conducts an attention-based scoring strategy to determine the informativeness of tokens at each layer. This hybrid approach can be integrated to balance fine and coarse-grained computation, ensuring that informative tokens are computed with higher granularity while uninformative tokens are clustered, thus optimizing token scoring efficiency.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n### KV Cache Optimization\nThe \"RetrievalAttention\" method optimizes resource utilization by retaining KV vectors in GPU memory following static patterns and offloading the majority of KV vectors to CPU memory. This strategy reduces latency and minimizes GPU memory utilization, which is crucial for efficient inference.\n\n### Unpad KV Cache and Input Tokens\nThe \"EMS-SD\" method introduces the concept of unpad KV cache and unpad input tokens, which eliminates the need for padding tokens and reduces computational and memory overhead. This approach ensures that KV cache access is continuous without padding, which can be optimized for hardware execution using CUDA kernels.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n### Combining Tree-Based Attention with Hybrid Granularity\nIntegrating tree-based attention mechanisms with hybrid granularity approaches can balance fine and coarse-grained computation. This can be achieved by using decision trees for hierarchical attention navigation and employing attention-based scoring strategies to determine token informativeness, as suggested in the analysis note.\n\n### Leveraging Hardware-Specific Optimizations\nImplementing hardware-specific optimizations such as dynamic sparse attention, KV cache optimization, and unpad KV cache and input tokens can significantly enhance the efficiency of the model. These optimizations can be integrated into the TTTLinear framework to ensure that the model leverages the most efficient attention computation and token scoring mechanisms available.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is highly efficient, scalable, and optimized for both computational resources and hardware capabilities.\n",

Near-Lossless Acceleration of Long Context LLM Inference with Adaptive Structured Sparse Attention (Avg.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/25 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nAdditionally, performance stabilizes when $\\alpha$ reaches a sufficiently high threshold. Thus, conducting a profiling to determine an appropriate $\\alpha$ for a given model is essential. Local window size and sampling ratio. Additionally, setting excessively small local window ratios or sampling ratios also results in performance decreases. Specifically, halving the ratio of the local window size ( $\\mathrm{k}=4$ ) results in a performance decline of over $6 \\%$ in the LongBench and \"Needle-in-aHaystack\" tasks. This confirms the high significance of KV elements within the local window area. Additionally, reducing the sampling ratio to $2 \\%$ results in an approximate $4.5 \\%$ performance loss. However, performance stabilizes once the sampling ratio reaches a certain threshold, as the top- k results for the approximate attention becomes stable. ### 5.4 Acceleration Speedup Benchmarking\n\nWe conducted micro-benchmarks on a single NVIDIA-A100 GPU (80GB) to evaluate performance in speed of attention operation during the prefill and TTFT metrics. The baselines selected were PyTorch's scaled_dot_product_attention (noted as SDPA) and FlashAttention2. All tests were conducted using the configuration from ChatGLM2-6B: 32 heads, and $d=128$, with synthetic data from the \"Needle-in-a-Haystack\" benchmark as input. We standardize the batch size of the input data to 1 to support longer sequence lengths. Speedup and sampling overhead Figure 5 displays the profiling results conducted on the model's full 28 layers using generated data ranging from 8 K to 96 K . Figure 5(a), focusing on the GPU performance of the attention module, indicates that both SampleAttention $(\\alpha=0.95)$ and SampleAttention $(\\alpha=0.80)$ do not exhibit a speed advantage over FlashAttention2 at shorter lengths, due to sampling overhead and small batch sizes. However, for longer sequences such as 96 K , substantial savings in KV memory-transfers enable the attention operations of SampleAttention $(\\alpha=0.95)$ and SampleAttention $(\\alpha=0.80)$ to achieve accelerations of $2.20 \\times$ and $5.12 \\times$ over FlashAttention2, while reducing the TTFT metric by $1.62 \\times$ and $2.28 \\times$, respectively. Furthermore, Figure 5 (c) demonstrates that as sequence lengths increase, the proportion of sampling overhead decreases, suggesting that SampleAttention can offer greater acceleration benefits for longer sequences. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c39be508fcc57a1ed0a2g-09.jpg?height=395&width=1396&top_left_y=976&top_left_x=363)\n\nFigure 5: (a) Latency comparison for the self-attention module.

SampleAttention significantly reduces the TTFT of long context requests.\n```\n\n#### 2. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.11)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/40 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nWe refer the readers to Appendix C. 6 for further details regarding the task and models. ### 4.7 LANGUAGE MODELLING\n\nWe perform experiments on the WikiText-103 data corpus (Merity et al., 2016) for the language modeling task. Here, the task is to predict probabilities for next or masked words, evaluated through perplexity. Quantitative Results: We use 6-layered transformer models with parameter. We plot the validation perplexity against epochs in Figure 7 which highlights that our proposed attention mechanism not only outperforms the baseline but also converges faster. Further, we see that our proposed model obtains test perplexity $38.8_{ \\pm 0.0}$ as opposed to baseline's perplexity $39.6_{ \\pm 0.3}$. We refer the reader to Appendix C. 7 for further details. ## 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-09.jpg?height=429&width=549&top_left_y=1146&top_left_x=1189)\n\nFigure 7: Performance on Language Modeling (WikiText103). We illustrate that our proposed mechanism outperforms the standard multi-head attention. Summary. In this work, we revisit Multi-Head Attention, a popular attention mechanism, and highlight its shortcomings due to the rigid association between search and retrieval mechanisms. We argue that this rigid coupling hinders re-usability of parameters and reduces the expressivity of the model. To mitigate this, we propose a novel mechanism which uses a value retrieval mechanism to flexibly compose searches and retrievals. Experiments on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms standard multi-head transformers, while often using only a fraction of retrievals. Complexity. While our proposed mechanism requires additional parameters for the computation of value scores, we highlight that this increase is often minuscule compared to the total number of parameters. Crucially, we note that this light increase in parameters per search mechanism is easily offset by reducing the number of retrievals needed. For all our experiments, our proposed models offer similar capacity as the baselines unless stated otherwise. This highlights that the improved performance is due to flexible composition of search and retrieval and not number of parameters. We discuss computational complexity in detail in Appendix B.5. Limitations and Conclusion. Motivated by the need for efficient factorization of knowledge and dynamic reusability of learned pieces of computations, we propose Compositional Attention, a first step towards flexible composition of search and retrieval.\n```\n\n#### 3. ChordMixer: A Scalable Neural Attention Model for Sequences with Different Lengths (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Ruslan Khalitov, Tong Yu, Lei Cheng, Zhirong Yang*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths, and substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential data naturally have different lengths in many domains, with some very long sequences. As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/29 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nSettings and results of three groups of experiments are provided in Section 4 . In Section 5, we conclude the paper and discuss future work. ## 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK\n\nA sequential data instance, or a sequence, is a one-dimensional array of sequence elements or tokens. In this work, tokens are represented by vectors of the same dimensionality. Therefore a sequence can be treated as a matrix $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}$, where $N$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the token dimensionality (or the number of channels). Each sequence may have a different length in a data set, and the distribution of $N$ can have a high range. Neural attention or mixing is a basic function of a neural network, which transforms a data tensor into another tensor toward the learning targets. In the self-attention setting, the input and output tensors usually have the same size. Without losing information, neural attention should have a full receptive field; that is, each output number can receive information from all input numbers. However, naively connecting each pair of input and output numbers is infeasible. Self-attention of a sequence $x$ with the naive implementation requires $N^{2} d^{2}$ connections, which is too expensive when $N d$ is large. Most existing neural attention methods employ two-stage mixing to relieve the expense due to the full connections. For example, the widely used Transformer model (Vaswani et al. 2017) alternates the token-wise and position-wise mixing steps. The connections are limited in each step, but the receptive field becomes full after one alternation. However, Transformer has a quadratic cost to sequence length because it fully connects every token pair. Numerous approximation methods of Transformer have been proposed to reduce the quadratic cost. For example, Longformer (Beltagy et al. 2020) and ETC (Ainslie et al. 2020) use a learnable side memory module that can access multiple tokens at once; Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021) uses a few landmarks as surrogates to the massive tokens; downsampling methods also include Perceiver (Jaegle et al., 2021) and Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021; 2022); Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al. 2021) approximate the softmax kernel by low-rank matrix products; Switch Transformer (Fedus et al., 2021) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) use sparse dot-products at multiple layers.\n```\n\n#### 4. Modeling Hierarchical Structures with Continuous Recursive Neural Networks  (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2021)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations of traditional RvNNs by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure.\n\n**Abstract:** Recursive Neural Networks (RvNNs), which compose sequences according to their underlying hierarchical syntactic structure, have performed well in several natural language processing tasks compared to similar models without structural biases. However, traditional RvNNs are incapable of inducing the latent structure in a plain text sequence on their own. Several extensions have been proposed to overcome this limitation. Nevertheless, these extensions tend to rely on surrogate gradients or reinforcement learning at the cost of higher bias or variance. In this work, we propose Continuous Recursive Neural Network (CRvNN) as a backpropagation-friendly alternative to address the aforementioned limitations. This is done by incorporating a continuous relaxation to the induced structure. We demonstrate that CRvNN achieves strong performance in challenging synthetic tasks such as logical inference and ListOps. We also show that CRvNN performs comparably or better than prior latent structure models on real-world tasks such as sentiment analysis and natural language inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/40 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nN., Kaiser, L. u., and Polosukhin, I.

AR-Diffusion: Auto-Regressive Diffusion Model for Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention implementation performance comparison*\n\n*Tong Wu, Zhihao Fan, Xiao Liu, Yeyun Gong, Yelong Shen, Jian Jiao, Haitao Zheng, Juntao Li, Zhongyu Wei, Jian Guo, Nan Duan, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models have gained significant attention in the realm of image generation due to their exceptional performance. Their success has been recently expanded to text generation via generating all tokens within a sequence concurrently. However, natural language exhibits a far more pronounced sequential dependency in comparison to images, and the majority of existing language models are trained with a left-to-right auto-regressive approach. To account for the inherent sequential characteristic of natural language, we introduce Auto-Regressive Diffusion (AR-Diffusion). AR-Diffusion ensures that the generation of tokens on the right depends on the generated ones on the left, a mechanism achieved through employing a dynamic number of denoising steps that vary based on token position. This results in tokens on the left undergoing fewer denoising steps than those on the right, thereby enabling them to generate earlier and subsequently influence the generation of tokens on the right. In a series of experiments on various text generation tasks, including text summarization, machine translation, and common sense generation, AR-Diffusion clearly demonstrated its superiority over existing diffusion language models and that it can be $100\\times\\sim600\\times$ faster when achieving comparable results.

PrivLM-Bench: A Multi-level Privacy Evaluation Benchmark for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention implementation performance comparison*\n\n*Haoran Li, Dadi Guo, Donghao Li, Wei Fan, Qi Hu, Xin Liu, Chunkit Chan, Duanyi Yao, Yangqiu Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** PrivLM-Bench is presented, a multi-perspective privacy evaluation benchmark to empirically and intuitively quantify the privacy leakage of LMs and performs existing privacy attacks on LMs with pre-defined privacy objectives as the empirical evaluation results.\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid development of language models (LMs) brings unprecedented accessibility and usage for both models and users. On the one hand, powerful LMs achieve state-of-the-art performance over numerous downstream NLP tasks. On the other hand, more and more attention is paid to unrestricted model accesses that may bring malicious privacy risks of data leakage. To address these issues, many recent works propose privacy-preserving language models (PPLMs) with differential privacy (DP). Unfortunately, different DP implementations make it challenging for a fair comparison among existing PPLMs. In this paper, we present PrivLM-Bench, a multi-perspective privacy evaluation benchmark to empirically and intuitively quantify the privacy leakage of LMs. Instead of only reporting DP parameters, PrivLM-Bench sheds light on the neglected inference data privacy during actual usage. PrivLM-Bench first clearly defines multi-faceted privacy objectives. Then, PrivLM-Bench constructs a unified pipeline to perform private fine-tuning. Lastly, PrivLM-Bench performs existing privacy attacks on LMs with pre-defined privacy objectives as the empirical evaluation results. The empirical attack results are used to fairly and intuitively evaluate the privacy leakage of various PPLMs. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets of GLUE for mainstream LMs.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Avil\u00e9s-Rivero, Jing Qin, Shujun Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a learnable decomposition strategy to capture dynamic trend information more reasonably and proposes a dual attention module tailored to capture inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations simultaneously for better time series forecasting.\n\n**Abstract:** Predicting multivariate time series is crucial, demanding precise modeling of intricate patterns, including inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations. Distinctive trend characteristics in each time series pose challenges, and existing methods, relying on basic moving average kernels, may struggle with the non-linear structure and complex trends in real-world data. Given that, we introduce a learnable decomposition strategy to capture dynamic trend information more reasonably. Additionally, we propose a dual attention module tailored to capture inter-series dependencies and intra-series variations simultaneously for better time series forecasting, which is implemented by channel-wise self-attention and autoregressive self-attention. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments across eight open-source datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. Through the comparison results, our Leddam (LEarnable Decomposition and Dual Attention Module) not only demonstrates significant advancements in predictive performance, but also the proposed decomposition strategy can be plugged into other methods with a large performance-boosting, from 11.87% to 48.56% MSE error degradation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention implementation performance comparison*\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on tree-based attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Tree-Based Attention\n\n- The Adaptive Large Chunk Context Attention (ALCCA) model introduces a tree-based attention mechanism inspired by the Barnes-Hut algorithm. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional attention methods. ALCCA achieves a 98.7% reduction in computations compared to full attention and an 87% reduction compared to both sliding window and sparse attention.\n\n## Real-World Implementation Results\n\n- ALCCA is implemented by replacing standard attention layers in the Mistral-7B-v0.3 model with custom ALCCA layers. This implementation includes FAISS integration for efficient nearest neighbor search, GPU-optimized operations, and adaptive thresholding. The model demonstrates improved efficiency in processing long sequences, reduced inference time, and lower energy consumption.\n\n## Benchmarking of Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- A comparative analysis of ALCCA with full attention, sliding window attention, and sparse attention shows that ALCCA has sub-quadratic complexity (O(n \u00b7 log(n) + k \u00b7 n)) and linear memory usage in sequence length. This is in contrast to the quadratic complexity (O(n^2)) of full attention and the O(n \u00b7 w) complexity of sliding window attention.\n\n## Trade-offs Between Different Implementations\n\n- The ALCCA mechanism involves trade-offs such as an approximation trade-off, which may sacrifice some accuracy for efficiency. It also requires careful tuning of parameters (\u03b8 and k) and has higher implementation complexity compared to standard attention mechanisms. However, it offers advantages in scalability, adaptive computation, and memory efficiency.\n\n## Empirical Results and Performance Metrics\n\n- The empirical results from ALCCA show significant computational efficiency gains. For a sequence of 1000 tokens, ALCCA reduces computations to approximately 11,000 compared to 1,000,000 for full attention and 100,000 for both sliding window and sparse attention. This results in reduced inference time and lower memory usage.\n\n## Tree-Based Attention Mechanism Proposal\n\n- A proposed approach to achieve O(log N) time complexity involves using tree-based structures like AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, or B-Tree. This method suggests using sentence-level embeddings and binary search to identify crucial sentences, which can help in maintaining the desired O(log N) complexity. However, this is still in the development phase and not yet implemented in real-world models.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- For tabular data, sparse neural networks with attention mechanisms have shown superior performance and interpretability compared to tree-based models. While this is not directly applicable to autoregressive language models, it highlights the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in capturing feature importance, which could be adapted to other domains.\n\nIn summary, the ALCCA model provides a robust example of a tree-based attention mechanism that offers significant improvements in computational efficiency, memory usage, and scalability. This aligns well with the goals of improving autoregressive language model design, particularly in terms of efficiency and performance metrics.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/53 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1909.08053, 2019.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Hi-transformer: Hierarchical interactive transformer for efficient and effective long document modeling (Avg.

However, it has difficulty in handling long documents due to the quadratic complexity with input text length. In order to handle this problem, we propose a hierarchical interactive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) for efficient and effective long document modeling. Hi-Transformer models documents in a hierarchical way, i.e., first learns sentence representations and then learns document representations. It can effectively reduce the complexity and meanwhile capture global document context in the modeling of each sentence. More specifically, we first use a sentence Transformer to learn the representations of each sentence. Then we use a document Transformer to model the global document context from these sentence representations. Next, we use another sentence Transformer to enhance sentence modeling using the global document context. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling method to obtain document embedding. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Hi-Transformer in long document modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/13 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nYi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, and Donald Metzler. 2020.

As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Shafiq R. Joty, S. Hoi, R. Socher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper attempts to bridge the gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity, and demonstrates that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage.\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 75  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tree Transformer: Integrating Tree Structures into Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yun-Nung Chen, Hung-Yi Lee, Yau-Shian Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-training Transformer from large-scale raw texts and fine-tuning on the desired task have achieved state-of-the-art results on diverse NLP tasks. However, it is unclear what the learned attention captures. The attention computed by attention heads seems not to match human intuitions about hierarchical structures. This paper proposes Tree Transformer, which adds an extra constraint to attention heads of the bidirectional Transformer encoder in order to encourage the attention heads to follow tree structures. The tree structures can be automatically induced from raw texts by our proposed \"Constituent Attention\" module, which is simply implemented by self-attention between two adjacent words. With the same training procedure identical to BERT, the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Tree Transformer in terms of inducing tree structures, better language modeling, and further learning more explainable attention scores.\n\n**Conference:** tree-transformer-integrating-tree-structures-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Simon Du, Beidi Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Yiping Wang, Yuandong Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Augmenting Transformers with Recursively Composed Multi-grained Representations\n\n*From Search Query: tree attention hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Wei Wu, Kewei Tu, Qingyang Zhu, Xiang Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present ReCAT, a recursive composition augmented Transformer that is able to explicitly model hierarchical syntactic structures of raw texts without relying on gold trees during both learning and inference. Existing research along this line restricts data to follow a hierarchical tree structure and thus lacks inter-span communications. To overcome the problem, we propose a novel contextual inside-outside (CIO) layer that learns contextualized representations of spans through bottom-up and top-down passes, where a bottom-up pass forms representations of high-level spans by composing low-level spans, while a top-down pass combines information inside and outside a span. By stacking several CIO layers between the embedding layer and the attention layers in Transformer, the ReCAT model can perform both deep intra-span and deep inter-span interactions, and thus generate multi-grained representations fully contextualized with other spans. Moreover, the CIO layers can be jointly pre-trained with Transformers, making ReCAT enjoy scaling ability, strong performance, and interpretability at the same time. We conduct experiments on various sentence-level and span-level tasks. Evaluation results indicate that ReCAT can significantly outperform vanilla Transformer models on all span-level tasks and baselines that combine recursive networks with Transformers on natural language inference tasks. More interestingly, the hierarchical structures induced by ReCAT exhibit strong consistency with human-annotated syntactic trees, indicating good interpretability brought by the CIO layers.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design focusing on tree-based attention mechanisms, hierarchical attention structures, logarithmic complexity implementations, and token importance scoring, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Tree-based Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of tree-based attention is not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, but there are mentions of hierarchical and structured attention mechanisms that can be relevant. For instance, the use of hierarchical structures in transformers is hinted at in the context of processing sequential data. The STEP model mentioned in uses a decoder-only transformer with standard positional encoding, which, although not tree-based, shows the effectiveness of structured attention in sequential data processing.\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Structures for Efficient Computation\n\n- The paper on Sparse Interpretable Neural Networks for Tabular Data discusses the use of attention mechanisms adapted for tabular data, which involves defining feature importance during training. While not specifically tree-based, this approach uses a structured method to capture feature interactions, which could be a precursor to more complex hierarchical structures.\n- The discussion on transformers as fully connected Graph Attention Networks (GATs) in suggests that hierarchical structures can be interpreted through the lens of graph-based attention mechanisms, which might be adapted to tree-based structures.\n\n## Logarithmic Complexity Attention Implementations\n\n- The Stack Overflow discussion mentions the idea of enhancing attention mechanisms to achieve logarithmic complexity using tree-based approaches. This is a direct match for the researcher's interest in logarithmic complexity claims. The discussion suggests that tree-based attention mechanisms can reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to logarithmic, which aligns with the goals of the TreeTTTLinear proposal.\n\n## Token Importance Scoring and Adaptive Computation\n\n- The sTabNet model described in uses attention mechanisms to capture feature importance during training, which is similar to token importance scoring. This approach ensures that the model learns meaningful latent features and can adapt to different datasets.\n- The STEP model employs a causal language modeling loss and uses separate vocabularies for each column, which naturally encodes intra-record positional information. This can be seen as a form of adaptive computation where the model predicts next tokens based on the context, although it is not explicitly described as token importance scoring.\n\n## Mathematical Formulations and Complexity Analysis\n\n- The mathematical formulations for attention mechanisms are detailed in, which explains the self-attention mechanism using dot products and softmax functions. This can serve as a foundation for adapting these mechanisms into tree-based or hierarchical structures.\n- The complexity analysis of attention mechanisms is touched upon in, where it is mentioned that the cost of attention increases quadratically with context length. This highlights the need for more efficient structures like tree-based attention to reduce complexity.\n\n## Performance Comparisons and Implementation Details\n\n- The performance comparisons in show that sparse nets with attention mechanisms outperform tree-based models for biomedical tabular datasets, indicating the potential of structured attention mechanisms.\n- The implementation details in and provide insights into how attention mechanisms can be integrated into transformer models and how they can be optimized for specific tasks, such as event prediction and tabular data processing.\n\nIn summary, while the exact term \"tree-based attention mechanisms\" is not directly addressed in the sources, the concepts of hierarchical attention, logarithmic complexity, and adaptive computation are discussed in various contexts that can be adapted and combined to achieve the researcher's goals. Further research into integrating these concepts into a unified model would be necessary to fully realize the TreeTTTLinear proposal.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C.

However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/51 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), pages 2321-2329, 2014.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers.

Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive token importance scoring transformer\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Focus on the Core: Efficient Attention via Pruned Token Compression for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Jungmin Yun, Mihyeon Kim, Youngbin Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining, which not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved dominant performance in numerous NLP tasks. Despite their remarkable successes, pre-trained transformers such as BERT suffer from a computationally expensive self-attention mechanism that interacts with all tokens, including the ones unfavorable to classification performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating two strategies: token pruning and token combining. Token pruning eliminates less important tokens in the attention mechanism's key and value as they pass through the layers. Additionally, we adopt fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and alleviate potential mispruning risks arising from an imbalanced distribution of each token's importance. Token combining, on the other hand, condenses input sequences into smaller sizes in order to further compress the model. By integrating these two approaches, we not only improve the model's performance but also reduce its computational demands. Experiments with various datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models, especially with the best improvement over the existing BERT model, achieving +5%p in accuracy and +5.6%p in F1 score. Additionally, memory cost is reduced to 0.61x, and a speedup of 1.64x is achieved.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Normalizing Mutual Information for Robust Adaptive Training for Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Youngwon Lee, Changmin Lee, Hojin Lee, Seung-won Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that NPMI better captures the dependence between source-target and that N PMI-based token-level adaptive training brings improvements over baselines with empirical results from En-De, De-En, and En-Ro translation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the success of neural machine translation models, tensions between fluency of optimizing target language modeling and source-faithfulness remain as challenges. Previously, Conditional Bilingual Mutual Information (CBMI), a scoring metric for the importance of target sentences and tokens, was proposed to encourage fluent and faithful translations. The score is obtained by combining the probability from the translation model and the target language model, which is then used to assign different weights to losses from sentences and tokens. Meanwhile, we argue this metric is not properly normalized, for which we propose Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI). NPMI utilizes an additional language model on source language to approximate the joint likelihood of source-target pair and the likelihood of the source, which is then used for normalizing the score. We showed that NPMI better captures the dependence between source-target and that NPMI-based token-level adaptive training brings improvements over baselines with empirical results from En-De, De-En, and En-Ro translation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

A Better Way to Do Masked Language Model Scoring\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Carina Kauf, Anna A. Ivanova*\n\n**TL;DR:** The original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and an adapted metric is proposed, in which not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target are masked, which better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models.\n\n**Abstract:** Estimating the log-likelihood of a given sentence under an autoregressive language model is straightforward: one can simply apply the chain rule and sum the log-likelihood values for each successive token. However, for masked language models (MLMs), there is no direct way to estimate the log-likelihood of a sentence. To address this issue, Salazar et al. (2020) propose to estimate sentence pseudo-log-likelihood (PLL) scores, computed by successively masking each sentence token, retrieving its score using the rest of the sentence as context, and summing the resulting values. Here, we demonstrate that the original PLL method yields inflated scores for out-of-vocabulary words and propose an adapted metric, in which we mask not only the target token, but also all within-word tokens to the right of the target. We show that our adapted metric (PLL-word-l2r) outperforms both the original PLL metric and a PLL metric in which all within-word tokens are masked. In particular, it better satisfies theoretical desiderata and better correlates with scores from autoregressive models. Finally, we show that the choice of metric affects even tightly controlled, minimal pair evaluation benchmarks (such as BLiMP), underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate scoring metric for evaluating MLM properties.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Backpropagation with Variance-Controlled Adaptive Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Ziteng Wang, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS) method designed to accelerate BP, which computes an unbiased stochastic gradient with fine-grained layerwise importance sampling in data dimension for activation gradient calculation and leverage score sampling in token dimension for weight gradient calculation.\n\n**Abstract:** Sampling-based algorithms, which eliminate ''unimportant'' computations during forward and/or back propagation (BP), offer potential solutions to accelerate neural network training. However, since sampling introduces approximations to training, such algorithms may not consistently maintain accuracy across various tasks. In this work, we introduce a variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS) method designed to accelerate BP. VCAS computes an unbiased stochastic gradient with fine-grained layerwise importance sampling in data dimension for activation gradient calculation and leverage score sampling in token dimension for weight gradient calculation. To preserve accuracy, we control the additional variance by learning the sample ratio jointly with model parameters during training. We assessed VCAS on multiple fine-tuning and pre-training tasks in both vision and natural language domains. On all the tasks, VCAS can preserve the original training loss trajectory and validation accuracy with an up to 73.87% FLOPs reduction of BP and 49.58% FLOPs reduction of the whole training process.

Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input to accelerate vision Transformers. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. While the framework is inspired by our observation of the sparse attention in vision Transformers, we find the idea of adaptive and asymmetric computation can be a general solution for accelerating various architectures. We extend our method to hierarchical models including CNNs and hierarchical vision Transformers as well as more complex dense prediction tasks that require structured feature maps by formulating a more generic dynamic spatial sparsification framework with progressive sparsification and asymmetric computation for different spatial locations. By applying lightweight fast paths to less informative features and using more expressive slow paths to more important locations, we can maintain the structure of feature maps while significantly reducing the overall computations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on various modern architectures and different visual recognition tasks. Our results clearly demonstrate that dynamic spatial sparsification offers a new and more effective dimension for model acceleration.

Learning A Sparse Transformer Network for Effective Image Deraining\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Jinshan Pan, Mingqiang Li, Hao Li, Xiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based methods have achieved significant performance in image deraining as they can model the non-local information which is vital for high-quality image reconstruction. In this paper, we find that most existing Transformers usually use all similarities of the tokens from the query-key pairs for the feature aggregation. However, if the tokens from the query are different from those of the key, the self-attention values estimated from these tokens also involve in feature aggregation, which accordingly interferes with the clear image restoration. To overcome this problem, we propose an effective DeRaining network, Sparse Transformer (DRSformer) that can adaptively keep the most useful self-attention values for feature aggregation so that the aggregated features better facilitate high-quality image reconstruction. Specifically, we develop a learnable top-k selection operator to adaptively retain the most crucial attention scores from the keys for each query for better feature aggregation. Simultaneously, as the naive feed-forward network in Transformers does not model the multi-scale information that is important for latent clear image restoration, we develop an effective mixed-scale feed-forward network to generate better features for image deraining. To learn an enriched set of hybrid features, which combines local context from CNN operators, we equip our model with mixture of experts feature compensator to present a cooperation refinement deraining scheme. Extensive experimental results on the commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Scene Adaptive Sparse Transformer for Event-based Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive token importance scoring transformer*\n\n*Feng Wu, Xiaoyan Sun, Yueyi Zhang, Hebei Li, Yansong Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** While recent Transformer-based approaches have shown impressive performances on event-based object detection tasks, their high computational costs still diminish the low power consumption advantage of event cameras. Image-based works attempt to reduce these costs by introducing sparse Transformers. However, they display inadequate sparsity and adaptability when applied to event-based object detection, since these approaches cannot balance the fine granularity of token-level sparsification and the efficiency of window-based Transformers, leading to reduced performance and efficiency. Furthermore, they lack scene-specific sparsity optimization, resulting in information loss and a lower recall rate. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Scene Adaptive Sparse Transformer (SAST). SAST enables window-token co-sparsification, significantly enhancing fault tolerance and reducing computational overhead. Leveraging the innovative scoring and selection modules, along with the Masked Sparse Window Self-Attention, SAST showcases remarkable scene-aware adaptability: It focuses only on important objects and dynamically optimizes sparsity level according to scene complexity, maintaining a remarkable balance between performance and computational cost. The evaluation results show that SAST outperforms all other dense and sparse networks in both performance and efficiency on two large-scale event-based object detection datasets (1Mpx and Gen1).

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/52 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\nnet/forum? id=X7XNPor93uG.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient tree attention implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient tree attention implementation*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient tree attention implementation*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient tree attention implementation*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hydragen: High-Throughput LLM Inference with Shared Prefixes\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient tree attention implementation*\n\n*Azalia Mirhoseini, Christopher R\u00e9, Daniel Y. Fu, Ryan Ehrlich, Bradley Brown, Jordan Juravsky*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) are now deployed to hundreds of millions of users. LLM inference is commonly performed on batches of sequences that share a prefix, such as few-shot examples or a chatbot system prompt. Decoding in this large-batch setting can be bottlenecked by the attention operation, which reads large key-value (KV) caches from memory and computes inefficient matrix-vector products for every sequence in the batch. In this work, we introduce Hydragen, a hardware-aware exact implementation of attention with shared prefixes. Hydragen computes attention over the shared prefix and unique suffixes separately. This decomposition enables efficient prefix attention by batching queries together across sequences, reducing redundant memory reads and enabling the use of hardware-friendly matrix multiplications. Our method can improve end-to-end CodeLlama-13b throughput by up to 32x against competitive baselines, with speedup growing with the batch size and shared prefix length. Hydragen also enables the use of very long shared contexts: with a large batch size, increasing the prefix length from 1K to 16K tokens decreases Hydragen throughput by less than 15%, while the throughput of baselines drops by over 90%. Hydragen generalizes beyond simple prefix-suffix decomposition and can be applied to tree-based prompt sharing patterns, allowing us to further reduce inference time on competitive programming problems by 55%.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient tree attention implementations, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Tree Structure Implementations\n- The paper on \"Recurrent Drafter for Fast Speculative Decoding in Large Language Models\" introduces a dynamic tree attention mechanism that is efficiently constructed using standard tensor operators. This approach is particularly beneficial for leveraging modern-day accelerators with minimal overhead. The dynamic tree attention reduces computational costs by de-duplicating draft tokens, which is crucial for hardware efficiency.\n\n## Memory Access Optimization for Hierarchical Attention\n- The same paper discusses the implementation of dynamic tree attention, which involves generating a prefix tree tensor to identify shared prefixes among candidate sequences. This method optimizes memory access by condensing tokens where prefixes are shared, reducing the number of tokens to be processed. This optimization is critical for efficient memory access patterns.\n\n## Cache-Friendly Attention Computation\n- While the specific papers provided do not directly address cache-friendly attention computation, the concept of using tree structures and dynamic attention mechanisms inherently suggests a more cache-friendly approach. For instance, the dynamic tree attention in reduces the number of tokens to be processed, which can lead to better cache utilization due to fewer and more predictable memory accesses.\n\n## CUDA Optimization for Tree-Based Models\n- The \"Recurrent Drafter\" paper includes experiments conducted on Nvidia H100 GPUs, leveraging tensor parallelism and continuous batching. This indicates that the dynamic tree attention mechanism is optimized for GPU acceleration, which is a key aspect of CUDA optimization. The paper demonstrates significant performance gains in terms of throughput and tokens per second when using dynamic tree attention on GPU environments.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The dynamic tree attention implementation in involves a GPU-friendly function that processes the initial tensor beam to generate a prefix tree tensor. This is done efficiently using standard tensor operators, which is crucial for hardware utilization strategies.\n- **Memory Access Patterns**: The use of a prefix tree tensor helps in identifying shared prefixes, which optimizes memory access by reducing the number of tokens to be processed. This approach ensures that memory access patterns are more predictable and efficient.\n- **Hardware Utilization Strategies**: The paper highlights the use of tensor parallelism and continuous batching on Nvidia H100 GPUs, which is a strategy to maximize hardware utilization. This approach demonstrates how to balance computational resources and achieve higher throughput and tokens per second.\n\nIn summary, the \"Recurrent Drafter\" paper provides valuable insights into hardware-efficient tree attention implementations, memory access optimization, and CUDA optimization for tree-based models, all of which are crucial for improving the design of autoregressive language models.\n",
