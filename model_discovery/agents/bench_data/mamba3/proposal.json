Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: state-space language models efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical GAUs*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state-space language models efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical GAUs*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Random Feature Attention\n\n*From Search Query: state-space language models efficient attention mechanisms hierarchical GAUs*\n\n*Hao Peng, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Roy Schwartz, Noah A.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 313  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 5.

Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Summary of Analysis\n\nThe researcher is interested in integrating state-space models (SSMs) into language models, with a focus on efficient attention mechanisms and hierarchical Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs). The key objectives include enhancing model performance, scalability, memory management, and robustness in autoregressive language modeling blocks. Here\u2019s a summary of the relevant findings:\n\n### Useful References with Excerpts\n\n#### State-Space Models in Language Processing\n- State-Space Models (SSMs) have shown promise in natural language processing (NLP) by capturing long-range dependencies and handling sequential data efficiently. They offer advantages such as parallel processing, linear complexity, and context-aware selectivity.\n\n#### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Recent studies have introduced attention-free architectures using SSMs, such as Mamba-2, which generalizes linear attention using structured state-space models. This approach balances computational efficiency and recall accuracy, particularly in memory-intensive tasks.\n\n#### Hierarchical Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs)\n- The concept of GAUs is not explicitly mentioned in the sources, but the idea of hierarchical structures can be inferred from the use of selective attention mechanisms. For example, the Taipan architecture combines the efficiency of Mamba with strategically placed Selective Attention Layers, optimizing resource allocation and enhancing performance in long-context language modeling.\n\n#### Optimizing State Transitions and Reducing Computational Complexity\n- SSMs can be optimized by using input-dependent transitions and integrating attention mechanisms. For instance, Peng et al. (2023) proposed integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms to enhance model performance. Additionally, the use of 1-semiseparable matrices in Mamba-2 simplifies the recurrence into a matrix multiplication, reducing computational complexity.\n\n#### Improving Long-Range Dependency Handling\n- SSMs excel in capturing long-range dependencies due to their ability to model complex dependencies within sequential data. The Taipan architecture, which combines Mamba with selective attention, allows for a longer sliding window to capture longer-range dependencies effectively.\n\n### Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **State-Space Models**: SSMs are particularly effective in modeling sequential data and capturing long-range dependencies, making them a competitive alternative to traditional transformer architectures, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**: The use of selective attention mechanisms, as seen in the Taipan architecture, optimizes resource allocation and enhances performance by applying attention only to tokens that benefit from it. This approach reduces computational complexity and improves the handling of long-range dependencies.\n- **Hierarchical Structures**: While GAUs are not explicitly mentioned, the hierarchical approach in architectures like Taipan suggests that similar hierarchical structures could be beneficial in GAUs, enhancing their efficiency and performance.\n- **Optimization Techniques**: Techniques such as input-dependent transitions and the integration of attention mechanisms can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of SSMs. The use of 1-semiseparable matrices further simplifies computations, making the models more scalable.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into GAUs**: Since the sources do not explicitly discuss GAUs, further research is needed to understand how hierarchical GAUs can be integrated with SSMs and efficient attention mechanisms.\n- **Experimental Studies**: Look for experimental studies or implementations that have tested the integration of SSMs with GAUs and efficient attention mechanisms to see the practical outcomes and challenges.\n- **Scalability and Memory Management**: Investigate more on how SSMs and hierarchical GAUs can be optimized for better memory management and scalability, especially in large language models.\n\n### List of References **Applications Of State-Space Modeling**.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 5. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

These approaches aim to approximate or modify traditional softmax attention to achieve linear time and space complexity, making them suitable for long sequences without substantial performance degradation.\n\n   - **Hierarchical and Modular Structures:**\n     The concept of hierarchical GAUs is echoed in the SeqBoat architecture (Ren et al., 2023), which employs a hierarchical activation strategy to balance local and global dependencies. This aligns with the internal library\u2019s findings on hierarchical structures enhancing model performance by organizing attention and state transitions in a layered manner.\n\n   - **Combining SSMs with Convolutional Approaches:**\n     Liu et al. (2024) introduce CHELA, which combines short-long convolutions with linear attention, suggesting that hybrid models leveraging both convolutional and state-space properties can effectively manage long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n   - **Adaptation and Scalability:**\n     The ability of models like GSS and DenseMamba to generalize to longer inputs and maintain efficiency underscores the importance of adaptable state transition mechanisms and dense connections. These features enable models to scale seamlessly with increasing data and model sizes, addressing one of the primary limitations of Transformer-based architectures.\n\n   - **Implementation and Practical Considerations:**\n     Several studies highlight the practical benefits of these architectures, including faster training times (GSS), better scalability (DenseMamba), and improved inference speeds (RFA). Ensuring hardware-efficient implementations and minimizing memory footprints are recurrent themes that facilitate the deployment of these models in real-world applications.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan:**\n   \n   While significant insights have been garnered from the current search results, further exploration is necessary to deepen the understanding of hierarchical GAUs and their integration with SSMs. Specifically:\n\n   - **Investigate Detailed GAU Structures:**\n     Delve deeper into the architectural designs of GAUs, focusing on hierarchical arrangements and their impact on model performance and efficiency.\n   \n   - **Explore Hybrid Models Combining SSMs and GAUs:**\n     Seek out studies or implementations that explicitly combine SSMs with hierarchical GAUs to assess how these components synergize to enhance language modeling tasks.\n   \n   - **Assess Long-Range Dependency Handling Mechanisms:**\n     Examine how different models manage long-range dependencies, comparing the effectiveness of various attention approximation techniques and hierarchical structures.\n   \n   - **Evaluate Scalability and Memory Management Strategies:**\n     Investigate methods employed in recent research to optimize memory usage and ensure scalability, particularly in the context of large-scale language models.\n   \n   - **Empirical Performance Benchmarks:**\n     Look for empirical studies that provide performance benchmarks of SSM-integrated GAUs against traditional Transformer models to understand the practical benefits and limitations.\n\n5. **List of References:**\n   \n   - He, W., Han, K., Tang, Y., Wang, C., Yang, Y., Guo, T., & Wang, Y.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 4.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 0 related papers from 0 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical GAUs state-space duality Transformer alternatives\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n\n",

Existing research highlights the efficacy of integrating gating mechanisms with State Space Models (SSMs) to improve training speed, scalability, and zero-shot generalization to longer sequences. Hierarchical structures within GAUs facilitate a balanced modeling of local and global dependencies, enhancing both performance and computational efficiency. Additionally, alternative attention mechanisms, such as Random Feature Attention (RFA) and Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), present promising avenues for reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving model expressiveness.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this work we focus on autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and ArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 4.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 0 related papers from 0 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical GAUs state-space duality Transformer alternatives\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n\n",

It establishes a theoretical bridge that allows SSMs to be viewed as a form of attention mechanism. This duality enables the transfer of optimization techniques and architectural innovations from Transformers to SSMs, enhancing their efficiency and scalability.\n   \n   - **Hierarchical GAUs Integration:** Integrating hierarchical GAUs within the SSD framework allows models to capture both local and global dependencies more effectively. Hierarchical structures enable the model to process information at multiple resolutions, balancing fine-grained local interactions with broader global contexts. This integration leads to significant improvements in handling long-range dependencies without incurring the quadratic complexity typical of Transformer-based attention mechanisms.\n   \n   - **Gated State Space (GSS) Layers:** The introduction of GSS layers enhances SSMs by incorporating gating mechanisms that allow selective information flow. This selective gating improves training speed and model scalability, as evidenced by faster convergence rates and efficient memory utilization. Additionally, GSS layers facilitate zero-shot generalization to longer sequences, a critical advantage for autoregressive language models.\n   \n   - **SSM-Augmented Transformers (SPADE):** Augmenting Transformers with SSMs, as demonstrated in the SPADE model, combines the strengths of both architectures. The SSM layer at the bottom provides a robust foundation for capturing global information, while subsequent layers utilize efficient local attention mechanisms to handle complex dependencies. This hybrid approach results in models that are both efficient and highly performant on benchmarks requiring long sequence handling.\n   \n   - **Expressive Capacity and Design Choices:** The expressive capacity of SSMs, particularly when combined with hierarchical GAUs, rivals that of Transformers in specific tasks. However, certain design choices in existing SSM implementations may limit their potential. Identifying and addressing these limitations can unlock further enhancements in model performance and applicability.\n   \n   - **Alternative Attention Mechanisms:** Exploring alternative attention mechanisms, such as Random Feature Attention (RFA) and Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), offers pathways to reduce computational overhead while maintaining or even improving expressiveness. These mechanisms can be synergistically integrated with hierarchical GAUs to achieve linear or near-linear complexity, making them suitable for large-scale and long-context language modeling tasks.\n   \n   - **Empirical Performance and Scalability:** Empirical studies consistently demonstrate that hierarchical GAU-integrated SSMs outperform traditional Transformers in both performance metrics and computational efficiency. Models like Mamba-2 and SPADE exhibit superior perplexity scores and faster training/inference times, validating the theoretical advantages proposed by the SSD framework.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan:**\n   \n   While the current analysis provides a solid foundation, further exploration is necessary to refine the design proposal:\n   \n   - **Deep Dive into Hybrid Architectures:** Investigate detailed implementations of hybrid models that combine hierarchical GAUs with SSMs. Focus on architectural diagrams, layer-by-layer interactions, and parameter configurations that optimize performance and efficiency.\n   \n   - **Empirical Benchmarks and Performance Metrics:** Seek out comprehensive empirical studies that benchmark hierarchical GAU-integrated SSMs against traditional Transformer models across various language modeling tasks.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid SSM attention architectures\"*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency.

While existing replay-based CL methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge by utilizing a memory buffer to store data from previous tasks, they generally overlook the interdependence between previously learned tasks and fail to encapsulate the optimally integrated knowledge in previous tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance of the previous tasks. Against this issue, we first reformulate replay-based CL methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework. We then incorporate the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned tasks and de-sign a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current task. To further stabilize the gradients of different tasks, we carefully devise a hyper-gradient-based implementation manner for POCL. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate that the proposed POCL outperforms current state-of-the-art CL methods across multiple datasets and different settings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Two of the primary barriers to its adoption are an inability to scale to larger problems and a limited ability to generalize to new tasks. We introduce a learned gradient descent optimizer that generalizes well to new tasks, and which has significantly reduced memory and computation overhead. We achieve this by introducing a novel hierarchical RNN architecture, with minimal per-parameter overhead, augmented with additional architectural features that mirror the known structure of optimization tasks. We also develop a meta-training ensemble of small, diverse, optimization tasks capturing common properties of loss landscapes. The optimizer learns to outperform RMSProp/ADAM on problems in this corpus. More importantly, it performs comparably or better when applied to small convolutional neural networks, despite seeing no neural networks in its meta-training set. Finally, it generalizes to train Inception V3 and ResNet V2 architectures on the ImageNet dataset for thousands of steps, optimization problems that are of a vastly different scale than those it was trained on.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 24*)\n\n#### 5.

However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 6.

Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW.

Mullins*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows, for the first time, how to rapidly adapt model architectures to new tasks in a many-task many-hardware few-shot learning setup by integrating Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) into the NAS flow.\n\n**Abstract:** Network Architecture Search (NAS) methods have recently gathered much attention. They design networks with better performance and use a much shorter search time compared to traditional manual tuning. Despite their efficiency in model deployments, most NAS algorithms target a single task on a fixed hardware system. However, real-life few-shot learning environments often cover a great number of tasks (T ) and deployments on a wide variety of hardware platforms (H ). The combinatorial search complexity T times H creates a fundamental search efficiency challenge if one naively applies existing NAS methods to these scenarios. To overcome this issue, we show, for the first time, how to rapidly adapt model architectures to new tasks in a many-task many-hardware few-shot learning setup by integrating Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) into the NAS flow. The proposed NAS method (H-Meta-NAS) is hardware-aware and performs optimisation in the MAML framework. H-Meta-NAS shows a Pareto dominance compared to a variety of NAS and manual baselines in popular few-shot learning benchmarks with various hardware platforms and constraints. In particular, on the 5-way 1-shot Mini-ImageNet classification task, the proposed method outperforms the best manual baseline by a large margin (5.21% in accuracy) using 60% less computation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

This efficiency is especially important in the case of on-device deployment, where improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data selection strategy. We show that our proposed method outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS.

HiFT: A Hierarchical Full Parameter Fine-Tuning Strategy\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory optimization\"*\n\n*Yongkang Liu, Yiqun Zhang, Qian Li, Tong Liu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Hinrich Sch\u00fctze*\n\n**Abstract:** Full-parameter fine-tuning has become the go-to choice for adapting language\nmodels (LMs) to downstream tasks due to its excellent performance. As LMs grow\nin size, fine-tuning the full parameters of LMs requires a prohibitively large\namount of GPU memory. Existing approaches utilize zeroth-order optimizer to\nconserve GPU memory, which can potentially compromise the performance of LMs as\nnon-zero order optimizers tend to converge more readily on most downstream\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a novel optimizer-independent end-to-end\nhierarchical fine-tuning strategy, HiFT, which only updates a subset of\nparameters at each training step. HiFT can significantly reduce the amount of\ngradients and optimizer state parameters residing in GPU memory at the same\ntime, thereby reducing GPU memory usage. Our results demonstrate that: (1) HiFT\nachieves comparable performance to parameter-efficient fine-tuning and standard\nfull parameter fine-tuning. (2) HiFT supports various optimizers including\nAdamW, AdaGrad, SGD, etc. (3) HiFT can save more than 60\\% GPU memory compared\nwith standard full-parameter fine-tuning for 7B model. (4) HiFT enables\nfull-parameter fine-tuning of a 7B model on single 48G A6000 with a precision\nof 32 using the AdamW optimizer, without using any memory saving techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-26T21:14:32Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-17T10:35:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. From Isolated Conversations to Hierarchical Schemas: Dynamic Tree Memory\n  Representation for LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory optimization\"*\n\n*Alireza Rezazadeh, Zichao Li, Wei Wei, Yujia Bao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large language models have significantly improved\ntheir context windows, yet challenges in effective long-term memory management\nremain. We introduce MemTree, an algorithm that leverages a dynamic,\ntree-structured memory representation to optimize the organization, retrieval,\nand integration of information, akin to human cognitive schemas. MemTree\norganizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated\ntextual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction\nlevels across the tree's depths. Our algorithm dynamically adapts this memory\nstructure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings of new and existing\ninformation to enrich the model's context-awareness. This approach allows\nMemTree to handle complex reasoning and extended interactions more effectively\nthan traditional memory augmentation methods, which often rely on flat lookup\ntables. Evaluations on benchmarks for multi-turn dialogue understanding and\ndocument question answering show that MemTree significantly enhances\nperformance in scenarios that demand structured memory management.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17T21:47:11Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-17T21:47:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Architext: Language-Driven Generative Architecture Design\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-aware model design\"*\n\n*Theodoros Galanos, Antonios Liapis, Georgios N.

Enabling intuitive, accessible, and scalable design processes is an\nimportant step towards performance-driven and sustainable design for all. To\nthat end, we introduce Architext, a novel semantic generation assistive tool.\nArchitext enables design generation with only natural language prompts, given\nto large-scale Language Models, as input. We conduct a thorough quantitative\nevaluation of Architext's downstream task performance, focusing on semantic\naccuracy and diversity for a number of pre-trained language models ranging from\n120 million to 6 billion parameters. Architext models are able to learn the\nspecific design task, generating valid residential layouts at a near 100% rate.\nAccuracy shows great improvement when scaling the models, with the largest\nmodel (GPT-J) yielding impressive accuracy ranging between 25% to over 80% for\ndifferent prompt categories.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid SSM attention architectures\"*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range of sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks at both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on sequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence modeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.

RNNs can generate bounded hierarchical languages with optimal memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory optimization\"*\n\n*Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang, Surya Ganguli, Michael Hahn, John Hewitt*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks empirically generate natural language with high syntactic fidelity. However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. BLISlab: A Sandbox for Optimizing GEMM\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory optimization\"*\n\n*Robert A. van de Geijn, Jianyu Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix-matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation of great importance to scientific computing and, increasingly, machine learning. It is a simple enough concept to be introduced in a typical high school algebra course yet in practice important enough that its implementation on computers continues to be an active research topic. This note describes a set of exercises that use this operation to illustrate how high performance can be attained on modern CPUs with hierarchical memories (multiple caches). It does so by building on the insights that underly the BLAS-like Library Instantiation Software (BLIS) framework by exposing a simplified \"sandbox\" that mimics the implementation in BLIS. As such, it also becomes a vehicle for the \"crowd sourcing\" of the optimization of BLIS. We call this set of exercises BLISlab.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-01\n\n\n\n#### 4.

MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15\\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6\\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5\\% compared to MobileNetV2.

Manu: A Cloud Native Vector Database Management System\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware-aware model design\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** With the development of learning-based embedding models, embedding vectors are widely used for analyzing and searching unstructured data. As vector collections exceed billion-scale, fully managed and horizontally scalable vector databases are necessary. In the past three years, through interaction with our 1200+ industry users, we have sketched a vision for the features that next-generation vector databases should have, which include long-term evolvability, tunable consistency, good elasticity, and high performance. We present Manu, a cloud native vector database that implements these features. It is difficult to integrate all these features if we follow traditional DBMS design rules. As most vector data applications do not require complex data models and strong data consistency, our design philosophy is to relax the data model and consistency constraints in exchange for the aforementioned features. Specifically, Manu firstly exposes the write-ahead log (WAL) and binlog as backbone services. Secondly, write components are designed as log publishers while all read-only analytic and search components are designed as independent subscribers to the log services. Finally, we utilize multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and a delta consistency model to simplify the communication and cooperation among the system components. These designs achieve a low coupling among the system components, which is essential for elasticity and evolution. We also extensively optimize Manu for performance and usability with hardware-aware implementations and support for complex search semantics.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hybrid SSM-attention architectures, memory optimization, and hardware-aware design, here are some key points and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Details of Hybrid SSM-Attention Architectures\n\n- Hybrid models that combine State Space Models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms have shown promising results. For example, the Falcon-Mamba-7B model integrates SSMs with attention layers, leveraging the strengths of both architectures. This hybrid approach improves performance across various tasks and maintains efficiency in handling long sequences.\n- The Zamba2-2.7B-Instruct model also uses a hybrid SSM-attention architecture, where Mamba2 layers are interleaved with shared attention layers. This design enhances instruction-following and reasoning capabilities while keeping a small inference compute and memory footprint.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Hierarchical Neural Networks\n\n- The use of Sequential Prefill instead of Parallel Prefill in SSMs can mitigate memory scaling issues, allowing for the processing of arbitrarily long prompts without significant memory increases.\n- Hybrid models like Zamba2-2.7B-Instruct achieve low inference latency and rapid generation with a smaller memory footprint compared to transformer-based models, thanks to their efficient use of SSMs and shared attention layers.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies for SSMs\n\n- Hardware-aware implementations are crucial for the efficiency of SSMs. For instance, the Falcon-Mamba-7B model leverages the theoretical efficiency of SSMs in handling large sequences, which is optimized for real-world use cases using the Hugging Face transformers library.\n- The Cheems architecture, which combines selective state space algorithms with quadratic self-attention, highlights the importance of effective position encoding and inner function attention to enhance state expressiveness, which can be optimized for hardware efficiency.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Multi-Scale Architectures\n\n- The performance of hybrid models is significantly improved by combining local and global context. For example, Zamba2-2.7B-Instruct outperforms other models in instruction-following benchmarks due to its ability to maintain both local and global context effectively.\n- The Cheems architecture demonstrates better perplexity performance on language modeling tasks by integrating selective state space algorithms with quadratic self-attention, showing the benefits of multi-scale processing.\n\n## Methods for Combining Local and Global Context\n\n- The FaceMamba model, which combines CNNs with SSMs, uses Attention Feature Injection (AFI) to integrate encoding, decoding, and external auxiliary features. This method enhances the model's ability to capture both local and global context, preserving identity features in facial sketch-photo synthesis.\n- The Zamba architecture concatenates the original model embeddings to the input of the attention block, which helps in better maintaining information across depth and combining local and global context.\n\n## Efficient State Management in Hybrid Models\n\n- Selective state compression, as seen in the Samba model, allows for maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism while reducing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n- The use of shared attention layers in Zamba2-2.7B-Instruct minimizes parameter costs and improves state management efficiency.\n\n## Scaling Strategies for Hierarchical Architectures\n\n- Scaling hybrid SSM-attention models beyond 2.8B parameters, such as in the Jamba 12B/52B models, shows that these architectures can maintain performance while scaling up. However, introducing attention layers can compromise the linear scalability of pure Mamba architectures.\n- The Cheems architecture proposes a cross-domain mixture of experts with reduced parameter redundancy, which helps in scaling the model efficiently.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The Falcon-Mamba-7B model avoids the need for key-value caching, which is a significant memory consumer in transformer models. Instead, it stores and attends to its recurrent state, reducing memory requirements during the decoding phase.\n- The use of inner function attention in the Cheems architecture retains the explicit storage of all historical context information without significant memory increases.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Design\n\n- The design of hybrid models like Falcon-Mamba-7B and Zamba2-2.7B-Instruct considers hardware efficiency, leveraging frameworks like Hugging Face to optimize memory usage and generation throughput.\n- The Cheems architecture emphasizes the importance of effective position encoding and inner function attention, which are optimized for hardware efficiency and performance.\n\n## Integration of Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The FaceMamba model integrates Face Vision Mamba Attention (FVMA) with Attention Feature Injection (AFI), combining encoding, decoding, and external auxiliary features using attention mechanisms. This integration enhances the model's performance in capturing long-range dependencies and preserving identity features.\n- The Zamba architecture combines Mamba2 layers with shared attention layers, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating different attention mechanisms to improve overall model performance.\n\nThese insights and references provide a comprehensive view of how hybrid SSM-attention architectures, memory optimization techniques, and hardware-aware design can be integrated to improve the performance and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention state space models\"*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Attention Prototypical Networks for Few-Shot Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention state space models\"*\n\n*Shengli Sun, Qingfeng Sun, Kevin Zhou, Tengchao Lv*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical attention prototypical networks (HAPN) for few-shot text classification and designs the feature level, word level, and instance level multi cross attention for this model to enhance the expressive ability of semantic space.\n\n**Abstract:** Most of the current effective methods for text classification tasks are based on large-scale labeled data and a great number of parameters, but when the supervised training data are few and difficult to be collected, these models are not available. In this work, we propose a hierarchical attention prototypical networks (HAPN) for few-shot text classification. We design the feature level, word level, and instance level multi cross attention for our model to enhance the expressive ability of semantic space, so it can highlight or weaken the importance of the features, words, and instances separately. We verify the effectiveness of our model on two standard benchmark few-shot text classification datasets\u2014FewRel and CSID, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The visualization of hierarchical attention layers illustrates that our model can capture more important features, words, and instances. In addition, our attention mechanism increases support set augmentability and accelerates convergence speed in the training stage.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention state space models\"*\n\n*Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Shuang Li, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE is proposed, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learn.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Multi-Scale Representation Learning on Proteins\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Vignesh Ram Somnath, Charlotte Bunne, Andreas Krause*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-scale graph construction of a protein -- HoloProt -- connecting surface to structure and sequence is introduced, and the model performs consistently and reliably across different dataset splits, outperforming all baselines on most splits.\n\n**Abstract:** Proteins are fundamental biological entities mediating key roles in cellular function and disease. This paper introduces a multi-scale graph construction of a protein -- HoloProt -- connecting surface to structure and sequence. The surface captures coarser details of the protein, while sequence as primary component and structure -- comprising secondary and tertiary components -- capture finer details. Our graph encoder then learns a multi-scale representation by allowing each level to integrate the encoding from level(s) below with the graph at that level. We test the learned representation on different tasks, (i.) ligand binding affinity (regression), and (ii.) protein function prediction (classification). On the regression task, contrary to previous methods, our model performs consistently and reliably across different dataset splits, outperforming all baselines on most splits. On the classification task, it achieves a performance close to the top-performing model while using 10x fewer parameters. To improve the memory efficiency of our construction, we segment the multiplex protein surface manifold into molecular superpixels and substitute the surface with these superpixels at little to no performance loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 82  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5.

Assessor360: Multi-sequence Network for Blind Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Tianhe Wu, Shu Shi, Haoming Cai, Ming Cao, Jing Xiao, Yinqiang Zheng, Yujiu Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel multi-sequence network for BOIQA called Assessor360 is proposed, derived from the realistic multi-assessor ODI quality assessment procedure, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple OIQA datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Blind Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (BOIQA) aims to objectively assess the human perceptual quality of omnidirectional images (ODIs) without relying on pristine-quality image information. It is becoming more significant with the increasing advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology. However, the quality assessment of ODIs is severely hampered by the fact that the existing BOIQA pipeline lacks the modeling of the observer's browsing process. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-sequence network for BOIQA called Assessor360, which is derived from the realistic multi-assessor ODI quality assessment procedure. Specifically, we propose a generalized Recursive Probability Sampling (RPS) method for the BOIQA task, combining content and details information to generate multiple pseudo-viewport sequences from a given starting point. Additionally, we design a Multi-scale Feature Aggregation (MFA) module with a Distortion-aware Block (DAB) to fuse distorted and semantic features of each viewport. We also devise Temporal Modeling Module (TMM) to learn the viewport transition in the temporal domain. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Assessor360 outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple OIQA datasets.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Modeling sequential annotations for sequence labeling with crowds\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Xiaolei Lu, Tommy W. S. Chow*\n\n**Abstract:** Crowd sequential annotations can be an efficient and cost-effective way to\nbuild large datasets for sequence labeling. Different from tagging independent\ninstances, for crowd sequential annotations the quality of label sequence\nrelies on the expertise level of annotators in capturing internal dependencies\nfor each token in the sequence. In this paper, we propose Modeling sequential\nannotation for sequence labeling with crowds (SA-SLC). First, a conditional\nprobabilistic model is developed to jointly model sequential data and\nannotators' expertise, in which categorical distribution is introduced to\nestimate the reliability of each annotator in capturing local and non-local\nlabel dependency for sequential annotation. To accelerate the marginalization\nof the proposed model, a valid label sequence inference (VLSE) method is\nproposed to derive the valid ground-truth label sequences from crowd sequential\nannotations. VLSE derives possible ground-truth labels from the token-wise\nlevel and further prunes sub-paths in the forward inference for label sequence\ndecoding. VLSE reduces the number of candidate label sequences and improves the\nquality of possible ground-truth label sequences.

A\n  Perspective from Symmetries\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Chao Ma, Lexing Ying*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we show that structures similar to self-attention are natural\nto learn many sequence-to-sequence problems from the perspective of symmetry.\nInspired by language processing applications, we study the orthogonal\nequivariance of seq2seq functions with knowledge, which are functions taking\ntwo inputs -- an input sequence and a ``knowledge'' -- and outputting another\nsequence. The knowledge consists of a set of vectors in the same embedding\nspace as the input sequence, containing the information of the language used to\nprocess the input sequence. We show that orthogonal equivariance in the\nembedding space is natural for seq2seq functions with knowledge, and under such\nequivariance the function must take the form close to the self-attention. This\nshows that network structures similar to self-attention are the right\nstructures to represent the target function of many seq2seq problems. The\nrepresentation can be further refined if a ``finite information principle'' is\nconsidered, or a permutation equivariance holds for the elements of the input\nsequence.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-13T05:10:48Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T05:10:48Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's\nattention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences.\nIn this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism\nthat approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions,\nyielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity.\nSpecifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence\ninto a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using\nthe second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention\nmechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input\nand an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention\noperation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We\nperform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks:\nlong-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language\nmodeling for large-scale pretraining.

Chain and Causal Attention for Efficient Entity Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Erwan Fagnou, Paul Caillon, Blaise Delattre, Alexandre Allauzen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates the limitations of transformers for entity-tracking\ntasks in large language models. We identify a theoretical constraint, showing\nthat transformers require at least $\\log_2 (n+1)$ layers to handle entity\ntracking with $n$ state changes. To address this issue, we propose an efficient\nand frugal enhancement to the standard attention mechanism, enabling it to\nmanage long-term dependencies more efficiently. By considering attention as an\nadjacency matrix, our model can track entity states with a single layer.\nEmpirical results demonstrate significant improvements in entity tracking\ndatasets while keeping competitive performance on standard natural language\nmodeling. Our modified attention allows us to achieve the same performance with\ndrastically fewer layers. Additionally, our enhanced mechanism reveals\nstructured internal representations of attention. Extensive experiments on both\ntoy and complex datasets validate our approach. Our contributions include\ntheoretical insights, an improved attention mechanism, and empirical\nvalidation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-07T23:54:10Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-07T23:54:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention state space models\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Da-Cheng Juan, Ines Chami, Frederic Sala, Adva Wolf, Sujith Ravi*\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean- and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attention-based transformations generalize to multiple relations. In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10.\n\n**Conference:** low-dimensional-hyperbolic-knowledge-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical attention state space models\"*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multi-scale Poisson process approaches for differential expression analysis of high-throughput sequencing data\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Estimating and testing for differences in molecular phenotypes (e.g. gene expression, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding) across conditions is an important part of understanding the molecular basis of gene regulation. These phenotypes are commonly measured using high-throughput sequencing assays (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), which provide high-resolution count data that reflect how the phenotypes vary along the genome. Multiple methods have been proposed to help exploit these high-resolution measurements for differential expression analysis. However, they ignore the count nature of the data, instead using normal approximations that work well only for data with large sample sizes or high counts. Here we develop count-based methods to address this problem. We model the data for each sample using an inhomogeneous Poisson process with spatially structured underlying intensity function, and then, building on multi-scale models for the Poisson process, estimate and test for differences in the underlying intensity function across samples (or groups of samples). Using both simulation and real ATAC-seq data we show that our method outperforms previous normal-based methods, especially in situations with small sample sizes or low counts.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. WavLM: Large-Scale Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Full Stack Speech Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale sequence processing\"*\n\n*Jian Wu, Xiangzhan Yu, Michael Zeng, Furu Wei, Yao Qian, Yanmin Qian, Shuo Ren, Long Zhou, Xiong Xiao, Takuya Yoshioka, Naoyuki Kanda, Jinyu Li, Zhuo Chen, Shujie Liu, Yu Wu, Zhengyang Chen, Chengyi Wang, Sanyuan Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning (SSL) achieves great success in speech recognition, while limited exploration has been attempted for other speech processing tasks. As speech signal contains multi-faceted information including speaker identity, paralinguistics, spoken content, etc., learning universal representations for all speech tasks is challenging. To tackle the problem, we propose a new pre-trained model, WavLM, to solve full-stack downstream speech tasks. WavLM jointly learns masked speech prediction and denoising in pre-training. By this means, WavLM does not only keep the speech content modeling capability by the masked speech prediction, but also improves the potential to non-ASR tasks by the speech denoising. In addition, WavLM employs gated relative position bias for the Transformer structure to better capture the sequence ordering of input speech. We also scale up the training dataset from 60k hours to 94k hours. WavLM Large achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SUPERB benchmark, and brings significant improvements for various speech processing tasks on their representative benchmarks.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the concepts of hierarchical attention, state space models, and efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical Attention with State Space Models\n\n- The Mamba and Mamba2 models integrate state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, offering a hierarchical approach. Mamba2, for instance, uses a structured state-space duality (SSD) that simplifies the state matrix into a scalar, enabling efficient and scalable processing of sequences.\n- The SC-MAMBA2 model extends this by introducing a bidirectional architecture to capture relationships among genes, which can be adapted for language models to handle bidirectional contextual relationships.\n\n## Multi-scale Processing in Language Models\n\n- The Mamba and Mamba2 architectures are designed to handle long-range dependencies efficiently, which is crucial for multi-scale processing. These models use a Markovian structure that allows for the capture of long-range dependencies without the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms.\n- The concept of State Space Duality (SSD) in Mamba2 enables the model to process sequences in a way that balances local and global contextual information, which is akin to multi-scale processing.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Mamba and Mamba2 models are notable for their near-linear scalability concerning sequence length, which significantly reduces the computational and memory overhead compared to traditional attention-based models. This is achieved through the use of structured state-space models and selective attention mechanisms.\n- The Taipan architecture combines Mamba with selective attention layers, optimizing resource allocation by applying attention only to tokens that benefit from it, thus improving computational efficiency and memory usage.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations of Combining Attention with SSMs\n\n- The work by Dao & Gu (2024) establishes a theoretical connection between SSMs and Transformers, providing a foundation for the SSD framework. This integration allows for efficient algorithms and generalized models that combine the strengths of both SSMs and attention mechanisms.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different Attention Architectures\n\n- The Taipan architecture is compared with other attention mechanisms and shows superior performance in scenarios requiring extensive in-context retrieval while maintaining computational efficiency. This suggests that the combination of Mamba with selective attention can outperform traditional attention mechanisms in certain tasks.\n- SC-MAMBA2 demonstrates superior performance over benchmark methods in various tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating SSMs with hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n\n## Optimization Techniques for Hierarchical Processing\n\n- The BiMamba module in SC-MAMBA2 is designed to handle bidirectional contextual relationships efficiently. This involves reversing the input sequence, processing it through weight-shared unidirectional Mamba modules, and combining the outputs, which optimizes the hierarchical processing.\n- The use of selective attention in Taipan optimizes resource allocation, enabling high performance while improving computational efficiency. This is achieved by applying attention only to tokens that benefit from it, reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n## State Management in Multi-scale Models\n\n- The Mamba and Mamba2 models manage state through the use of latent state representations in SSMs. This allows for efficient capture and processing of temporal dependencies across different scales.\n- The discretization process in SSMs transforms continuous matrices into discrete counterparts, making it more suitable for implementation in modern computational frameworks and ensuring efficient state management.\n\n## Implementation Details of Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The Mamba2 model uses a 1-semiseparable matrix to encode temporal dependencies and content-based interactions, which is more efficient than full attention or standard windowed attention. This approach allows for a sparser attention weight map, enhancing computational efficiency.\n- The Smart Padding mechanism in BiMamba ensures that only meaningful tokens are processed, preventing artifacts during the reversing process and optimizing the attention mechanism.\n\n## Scalability Analysis of Hierarchical Models\n\n- The Mamba and Mamba2 models are designed to scale linearly with sequence length, preserving comparable modeling abilities to transformers while reducing computational complexity. This makes them highly scalable for large datasets and longer sequences.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Language Models\n\n- The selective attention mechanism in Taipan and the use of SSMs in Mamba and Mamba2 models significantly reduce memory requirements by avoiding unnecessary computations and using a more efficient representation of attention weights.\n\nIn summary, the integration of hierarchical attention with state space models, as seen in Mamba, Mamba2, and SC-MAMBA2, offers a promising approach for improving autoregressive language models. These models provide efficient, scalable, and memory-optimized solutions for handling long-range dependencies and multi-scale processing, making them strong candidates for advancing the state-of-the-art in language modeling.\n",

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Raunaq M. Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Lowering the threshold for LLMs training would encourage greater participation from researchers, benefiting both academia and society. While existing approaches have focused on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, which tunes or adds a small number of parameters, few have addressed the challenge of tuning the full parameters of LLMs with limited resources. In this work, we propose a new optimizer, LOw-Memory Optimization (LOMO), which fuses the gradient computation and the parameter update in one step to reduce memory usage. By integrating LOMO with existing memory saving techniques, we reduce memory usage to 10.8% compared to the standard approach (DeepSpeed solution). Consequently, our approach enables the full parameter fine-tuning of a 65B model on a single machine with 8 RTX 3090, each with 24GB memory.Code and data are available at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 76  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5.

While PPO is a powerful method designed for general reinforcement learning tasks, it is overly sophisticated for LLMs, leading to laborious hyper-parameter tuning and significant computation burdens. To make RLHF efficient, we present ReMax, which leverages 3 properties of RLHF: fast simulation, deterministic transitions, and trajectory-level rewards. These properties are not exploited in PPO, making it less suitable for RLHF. Building on the renowned REINFORCE algorithm, ReMax does not require training an additional value model as in PPO and is further enhanced with a new variance reduction technique. ReMax offers several benefits over PPO: it is simpler to implement, eliminates more than 4 hyper-parameters in PPO, reduces GPU memory usage, and shortens training time. ReMax can save about 46% GPU memory than PPO when training a 7B model and enables training on A800-80GB GPUs without the memory-saving offloading technique needed by PPO. Applying ReMax to a Mistral-7B model resulted in a 94.78% win rate on the AlpacaEval leaderboard and a 7.739 score on MT-bench, setting a new SOTA for open-source 7B models. These results show the effectiveness of ReMax while addressing the limitations of PPO in LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. IIANet: An Intra- and Inter-Modality Attention Network for Audio-Visual Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Kai Li, Run Yang, Fuchun Sun, Xiaolin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The fast version of IIANet (IIANet-fast) has only 7% of CTCNet's MACs and is 40% faster than CTCNet on CPUs while achieving better separation quality, showing the great potential of attention mechanism for efficient and effective multimodal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research has made significant progress in designing fusion modules for audio-visual speech separation. However, they predominantly focus on multi-modal fusion at a single temporal scale of auditory and visual features without employing selective attention mechanisms, which is in sharp contrast with the brain. To address this issue, We propose a novel model called Intra- and Inter-Attention Network (IIANet), which leverages the attention mechanism for efficient audio-visual feature fusion. IIANet consists of two types of attention blocks: intra-attention (IntraA) and inter-attention (InterA) blocks, where the InterA blocks are distributed at the top, middle and bottom of IIANet. Heavily inspired by the way how human brain selectively focuses on relevant content at various temporal scales, these blocks maintain the ability to learn modality-specific features and enable the extraction of different semantics from audio-visual features. Comprehensive experiments on three standard audio-visual separation benchmarks (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrate the effectiveness of IIANet, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable inference time. In particular, the fast version of IIANet (IIANet-fast) has only 7% of CTCNet's MACs and is 40% faster than CTCNet on CPUs while achieving better separation quality, showing the great potential of attention mechanism for efficient and effective multimodal fusion.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

More specifically, built upon the Transformer architecture, our model is further equipped with novel multi-modal feature fusion techniques and attention mechanisms, which are designed to generate named entities more accurately.

Revisiting Hierarchical Text Classification: Inference and Metrics\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Roman Plaud, Matthieu Labeau, Antoine Saillenfest, Thomas Bonald*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical text classification (HTC) is the task of assigning labels to a\ntext within a structured space organized as a hierarchy. Recent works treat HTC\nas a conventional multilabel classification problem, therefore evaluating it as\nsuch.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization language models\"*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning\nand further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with\nAdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the\nhardware barrier to training large language models.

HiFT: A Hierarchical Full Parameter Fine-Tuning Strategy\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization language models\"*\n\n*Yongkang Liu, Yiqun Zhang, Qian Li, Tong Liu, Shi Feng, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang, Hinrich Sch\u00fctze*\n\n**Abstract:** Full-parameter fine-tuning has become the go-to choice for adapting language\nmodels (LMs) to downstream tasks due to its excellent performance. As LMs grow\nin size, fine-tuning the full parameters of LMs requires a prohibitively large\namount of GPU memory. Existing approaches utilize zeroth-order optimizer to\nconserve GPU memory, which can potentially compromise the performance of LMs as\nnon-zero order optimizers tend to converge more readily on most downstream\ntasks. In this paper, we propose a novel optimizer-independent end-to-end\nhierarchical fine-tuning strategy, HiFT, which only updates a subset of\nparameters at each training step. HiFT can significantly reduce the amount of\ngradients and optimizer state parameters residing in GPU memory at the same\ntime, thereby reducing GPU memory usage. Our results demonstrate that: (1) HiFT\nachieves comparable performance to parameter-efficient fine-tuning and standard\nfull parameter fine-tuning. (2) HiFT supports various optimizers including\nAdamW, AdaGrad, SGD, etc. (3) HiFT can save more than 60\\% GPU memory compared\nwith standard full-parameter fine-tuning for 7B model.

Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's\nattention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences.\nIn this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism\nthat approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions,\nyielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity.\nSpecifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence\ninto a sequence of fixed length.

Multiresolution Graph Transformers and Wavelet Positional Encoding for Learning Hierarchical Structures\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Risi Kondor, Truong Son Hy, Nhat Khang Ngo*\n\n**Abstract:** Contemporary graph learning algorithms are not well-defined for large molecules since they do not consider the hierarchical interactions among the atoms, which are essential to determine the molecular properties of macromolecules. In this work, we propose Multiresolution Graph Transformers (MGT), the first graph transformer architecture that can learn to represent large molecules at multiple scales. MGT can learn to produce representations for the atoms and group them into meaningful functional groups or repeating units. We also introduce Wavelet Positional Encoding (WavePE), a new positional encoding method that can guarantee localization in both spectral and spatial domains. Our proposed model achieves competitive results on two macromolecule datasets consisting of polymers and peptides, and one drug-like molecule dataset. Importantly, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves chemical accuracy in estimating molecular properties (e.g., GAP, HOMO and LUMO) calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the polymers dataset. Furthermore, the visualizations, including clustering results on macromolecules and low-dimensional spaces of their representations, demonstrate the capability of our methodology in learning to represent long-range and hierarchical structures.

A no-regret generalization of hierarchical softmax to extreme multi-label classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical state space models implementation\"*\n\n*Krzysztof Dembczy\u0144ski, R\u00f3bert Busa-Fekete, Marek Wydmuch, Kalina Jasinska, Mikhail Kuznetsov*\n\n**Abstract:** Extreme multi-label classification (XMLC) is a problem of tagging an instance\nwith a small subset of relevant labels chosen from an extremely large pool of\npossible labels. Large label spaces can be efficiently handled by organizing\nlabels as a tree, like in the hierarchical softmax (HSM) approach commonly used\nfor multi-class problems. In this paper, we investigate probabilistic label\ntrees (PLTs) that have been recently devised for tackling XMLC problems. We\nshow that PLTs are a no-regret multi-label generalization of HSM when\nprecision@k is used as a model evaluation metric. Critically, we prove that\npick-one-label heuristic - a reduction technique from multi-label to\nmulti-class that is routinely used along with HSM - is not consistent in\ngeneral. We also show that our implementation of PLTs, referred to as\nextremeText (XT), obtains significantly better results than HSM with the\npick-one-label heuristic and XML-CNN, a deep network specifically designed for\nXMLC problems. Moreover, XT is competitive to many state-of-the-art approaches\nin terms of statistical performance, model size and prediction time which makes\nit amenable to deploy in an online system.\n\n**Conference:** a-no-regret-generalization-of-hierarchical-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. BAdam: A Memory Efficient Full Parameter Optimization Method for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization language models\"*\n\n*Xiao Li, Hengxu Yu, Qijun Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** This work presents BAdam, an optimization method that leverages the block coordinate descent framework with Adam as the inner solver. BAdam offers a memory efficient approach to the full parameter finetuning of large language models. We conduct theoretical convergence analysis for BAdam in the deterministic case. Experimentally, we apply BAdam to instruction-tune the Llama 2-7B and Llama 3-8B models using a single RTX3090-24GB GPU. The results confirm BAdam's efficiency in terms of memory and running time. Additionally, the convergence verification indicates that BAdam exhibits superior convergence behavior compared to LoRA. Furthermore, the downstream performance evaluation using the MT-bench shows that BAdam modestly surpasses LoRA and more substantially outperforms LOMO. Finally, we compare BAdam with Adam on a medium-sized task, i.e., finetuning RoBERTa-large on the SuperGLUE benchmark. The results demonstrate that BAdam is capable of narrowing the performance gap with Adam more effectively than LoRA.

Long Context Transfer from Language to Vision\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory optimization language models\"*\n\n*Ziwei Liu, Chunyuan Li, Haoran Tan, Ziyue Wang, Yuanhan Zhang, Jingkang Yang, Guangtao Zeng, Bo Li, Kaichen Zhang, Peiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Video sequences offer valuable temporal information, but existing large multimodal models (LMMs) fall short in understanding extremely long videos. Many works address this by reducing the number of visual tokens using visual resamplers. Alternatively, in this paper, we approach this problem from the perspective of the language model. By simply extrapolating the context length of the language backbone, we enable LMMs to comprehend orders of magnitude more visual tokens without any video training. We call this phenomenon long context transfer and carefully ablate its properties. To effectively measure LMMs' ability to generalize to long contexts in the vision modality, we develop V-NIAH (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack), a purely synthetic long vision benchmark inspired by the language model's NIAH test. Our proposed Long Video Assistant (LongVA) can process 2000 frames or over 200K visual tokens without additional complexities. With its extended context length, LongVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Video-MME among 7B-scale models by densely sampling more input frames.

Enhancing Few-Shot Image Classification through Learnable Multi-Scale Embedding and Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Mohammadi, Amirreza Fateh, Fatemeh Askari*\n\n**Abstract:** In the context of few-shot classification, the goal is to train a classifier using a limited number of samples while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, traditional metric-based methods exhibit certain limitations in achieving this objective. These methods typically rely on a single distance value between the query feature and support feature, thereby overlooking the contribution of shallow features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper. Our approach involves utilizing multi-output embedding network that maps samples into distinct feature spaces. The proposed method extract feature vectors at different stages, enabling the model to capture both global and abstract features. By utilizing these diverse feature spaces, our model enhances its performance. Moreover, employing a self-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage, leading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance. Furthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved performance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the MiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed a cross-domain task from MiniImageNet to the CUB dataset, achieving high accuracy in the testing domain. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. Frame-Level Multi-Label Playing Technique Detection Using Multi-Scale Network and Self-Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Wei Li, Fan Xia, Yi Yu, Yulun Wu, Wenwu Meng, Mingjin Che, Dichucheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Instrument playing technique (IPT) is a key element of musical presentation. However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction. Our approach outperforms existing works by a large margin, indicating its effectiveness in IPT detection.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical state space models, memory optimization, and multi-scale attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Implementation Details of Hierarchical State Space Models\n\n- The paper on \"Efficient State Space Model (eSSM)\" introduces a new state space layer based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SSMs. This model uses convolutional representations, diagonalization, and fast tensor convolution via fast Fourier transform (FFT) to improve computational efficiency. The eSSM is designed to handle long sequences efficiently and can be stacked as a deep model, showing matchable state-of-the-art performance with improved model efficiency.\n\n- \"Spatial-Mamba\" extends the Mamba model by introducing a structure-aware state fusion (SASF) equation to capture spatial dependencies in visual data. This approach involves converting visual data into sequential data, applying state transition equations, and then using dilated convolutions to integrate local spatial dependencies. This method enhances the model's ability to handle 2D visual tasks while maintaining the benefits of original Mamba models.\n\n- \"SC-MAMBA2\" integrates state-space models (SSMs) with the Mamba framework for single-cell ultra-long transcriptome data. It uses a bidirectional architecture to efficiently learn relationships among genes, demonstrating superior performance in various single-cell analysis tasks. This model leverages continuous SSMs and discretization techniques to handle extensive gene sequences efficiently.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Language Models\n\n- The \"eSSM\" model addresses memory optimization by reducing the number of model parameters through block diagonalization of the SSM. This approach improves both computational and storage efficiency, which is crucial for handling long sequences.\n\n- \"Spatial-Mamba\" and \"Mamba\" models utilize re-parameterization techniques and optimized CUDA kernels to enhance model efficiency. These methods help in reducing the computational cost and memory consumption, making the models more efficient for large-scale tasks.\n\n## Integration Methods for Multi-Scale Attention\n\n- \"Spatial-Mamba\" introduces a structure-aware state fusion (SASF) equation that leverages dilated convolutions to capture local spatial structural dependencies. This approach integrates multi-scale feature information effectively, enhancing the model's performance in visual tasks.\n\n- \"SC-MAMBA2\" uses a bidirectional architecture to capture both local and global contextual information in gene sequences. This multi-scale processing approach improves the model's ability to handle complex dependencies between genes.\n\n## State Management in Hierarchical Models\n\n- The \"eSSM\" model employs a convolutional representation and diagonalization to manage the state efficiently. The model parameters are carefully initialized and restricted to ensure state convergence, which is essential for state management in hierarchical models.\n\n- \"SC-MAMBA2\" manages state through a continuous SSM framework, which is then discretized for implementation. This approach ensures that the model can handle extensive gene sequences while maintaining efficient state transitions.\n\n## Performance Analysis and Computational Efficiency\n\n- The \"eSSM\" model demonstrates improved computational efficiency through the use of fast tensor convolution and block diagonalization. This results in matchable state-of-the-art performance with reduced model parameters and improved flexibility.\n\n- \"Spatial-Mamba\" and \"SC-MAMBA2\" models show superior performance in their respective tasks by efficiently capturing long-range dependencies and spatial or gene sequence information. These models achieve linear complexity and scalability, which is crucial for large-scale data processing.\n\n## Scaling Strategies for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The integration of hierarchical structures with SSMs, as seen in \"Spatial-Mamba\" and \"SC-MAMBA2,\" allows for scalable modeling of long sequences and complex data. These models can handle extensive data sets efficiently by leveraging linear complexity and parallel computing.\n\n## Trade-offs Between Complexity and Performance\n\n- The \"eSSM\" and \"Spatial-Mamba\" models highlight the trade-offs between complexity and performance. While these models introduce more complex mechanisms like diagonalization and structure-aware state fusion, they also achieve significant improvements in efficiency and performance.\n\n## Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- \"SC-MAMBA2\" uses a data-dependent selection mechanism, similar to Mamba, which simplifies the computation and architecture in a hardware-friendly way. This adaptive approach allows the model to efficiently learn relationships among genes and adapt to different tasks.\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Representations\n\n- The use of diagonal plus low-rank matrix representations in SSMs, as mentioned in the context of Mamba and S4 models, helps in reducing the number of parameters and improving memory efficiency. This approach is also seen in the \"eSSM\" model, which uses block diagonalization to reduce model parameters.\n\nIn summary, these papers provide valuable insights into the implementation of hierarchical state space models, memory optimization techniques, and multi-scale attention mechanisms. They highlight the importance of efficient state management, computational efficiency, and the integration of different mechanisms to achieve better performance and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Wei He, Kai Han, Yehui Tang, Chengcheng Wang, Yujie Yang, Tianyu Guo, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** DenseSSM is introduced, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs by selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, and retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Amortized Variational Inference for Simple Hierarchical Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization hierarchical models\"*\n\n*Abhinav Agrawal, Justin Domke*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper suggests an amortized approach where shared parameters simultaneously represent all local distributions, which is similarly accurate as using a given joint distribution but is feasible on datasets that are several orders of magnitude larger.\n\n**Abstract:** It is difficult to use subsampling with variational inference in hierarchical models since the number of local latent variables scales with the dataset. Thus, inference in hierarchical models remains a challenge at large scale. It is helpful to use a variational family with structure matching the posterior, but optimization is still slow due to the huge number of local distributions. Instead, this paper suggests an amortized approach where shared parameters simultaneously represent all local distributions. This approach is similarly accurate as using a given joint distribution (e.g., a full-rank Gaussian) but is feasible on datasets that are several orders of magnitude larger. It is also dramatically faster than using a structured variational distribution.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6.

However, explorations on such relationships are limited. Most works pay attention to some common mathematical properties, such as sparsity. In this work, we propose a new type of implicit model inspired by the designing of the systems\u2019 hidden objective functions, called the Multi-branch Optimization induced Equilibrium networks (MOptEqs). The model architecture is designed based on modelling the hidden objective function for the multi-resolution recognition task.

In this manner, the proposed model can better utilize the hierarchical patterns for recognition tasks and retain the abilities for interpreting the whole structure as trying to obtain the minima of the problem\u2019s goal. Comparing with the state-of-the-art models, our MOptEqs not only enjoys better explainability but are also superior to MDEQ with less parameter consumption and better performance on practical tasks.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale SSM attention\"*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Therefore, we propose a novel Multi-Scale Progressive Attention Network (MSPAN) to achieve relational reasoning between cross-scale video information. We construct clips of different lengths to represent different scales of the video. Then, the clip-level features are aggregated into node features by using max-pool, and a graph is generated for each scale of clips. For cross-scale feature interaction, we design a message passing strategy between adjacent scale graphs, i.e., top-down scale interaction and bottom-up scale interaction. Under the question\u2019s guidance of progressive attention, we realize the fusion of all-scale video features.

Multi-Scale Representations by Varying Window Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale SSM attention\"*\n\n*Haotian Yan, Ming Wu, Chuang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel multi-scale learner, varying window attention (VWA), is presented to address issues of scale inadequacy and field inactivation in canonical multi-scale representations, and a multi-scale decoder (MSD) is introduced, VWFormer, to improve multi-scale representations for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale learning is central to semantic segmentation. We visualize the effective receptive field (ERF) of canonical multi-scale representations and point out two risks in learning them: scale inadequacy and field inactivation. A novel multi-scale learner, varying window attention (VWA), is presented to address these issues. VWA leverages the local window attention (LWA) and disentangles LWA into the query window and context window, allowing the context's scale to vary for the query to learn representations at multiple scales. However, varying the context to large-scale windows (enlarging ratio R) can significantly increase the memory footprint and computation cost (R^2 times larger than LWA). We propose a simple but professional re-scaling strategy to zero the extra induced cost without compromising performance. Consequently, VWA uses the same cost as LWA to overcome the receptive limitation of the local window. Furthermore, depending on VWA and employing various MLPs, we introduce a multi-scale decoder (MSD), VWFormer, to improve multi-scale representations for semantic segmentation. VWFormer achieves efficiency competitive with the most compute-friendly MSDs, like FPN and MLP decoder, but performs much better than any MSDs. For instance, using nearly half of UPerNet's computation, VWFormer outperforms it by 1.0%-2.5% mIoU on ADE20K. With little extra overhead, ~10G FLOPs, Mask2Former armed with VWFormer improves by 1.0%-1.3%.

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism.

As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale SSM attention\"*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Orhan Firat, Christopher Pal, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nmodeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing\nto their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer\n(BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range\ncontextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term\nrepresentation of sequences. We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the\nBlock-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the\nlayer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model\nparallelization is employed.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-15T22:48:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-30T15:44:04Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Boqing Gong, Matthew Brown, Mingxing Tan, Li Zhang, Yandong Li, Liangzhe Yuan, Dan Kondratyuk*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Mobile Video Networks (MoViNets), a family of computation and memory efficient video networks that can operate on streaming video for online inference. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are accurate at video recognition but require large computation and memory budgets and do not support online inference, making them difficult to work on mobile devices. We propose a three-step approach to improve computational efficiency while substantially reducing the peak memory usage of 3D CNNs. First, we design a video network search space and employ neural architecture search to generate efficient and diverse 3D CNN architectures. Second, we introduce the Stream Buffer technique that decouples memory from video clip duration, allowing 3D CNNs to embed arbitrary-length streaming video sequences for both training and inference with a small constant memory footprint. Third, we propose a simple ensembling technique to improve accuracy further without sacrificing efficiency. These three progressive techniques allow MoViNets to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on the Kinetics, Moments in Time, and Charades video action recognition datasets. For instance, MoViNet-A5-Stream achieves the same accuracy as X3D-XL on Kinetics 600 while requiring 80% fewer FLOPs and 65% less memory.

Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Nagel, Michael Bussmann, Benjamin Worpitz, Guido Juckeland, Axel Huebl*\n\n**Abstract:** Porting applications to new hardware or programming models is a tedious and\nerror prone process. Every help that eases these burdens is saving developer\ntime that can then be invested into the advancement of the application itself\ninstead of preserving the status-quo on a new platform.\n  The Alpaka library defines and implements an abstract hierarchical redundant\nparallelism model. The model exploits parallelism and memory hierarchies on a\nnode at all levels available in current hardware. By doing so, it allows to\nachieve platform and performance portability across various types of\naccelerators by ignoring specific unsupported levels and utilizing only the\nones supported on a specific accelerator. All hardware types (multi- and\nmany-core CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators) are supported for and can be\nprogrammed in the same way. The Alpaka C++ template interface allows for\nstraightforward extension of the library to support other accelerators and\nspecialization of its internals for optimization.\n  Running Alpaka applications on a new (and supported) platform requires the\nchange of only one source code line instead of a lot of \\#ifdefs.\n\n**Published:** 2016-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, it remains challenging to carry the well-trained deep models for online real-time inference serving, with respect to the time-varying web-scale traffics from billions of users, in a cost-effective manner. In this work, we present JIZHI - a Model-as-a-Service system - that per second handles hundreds of millions of online inference requests to huge deep models with more than trillions of sparse parameters, for over twenty real-time recommendation services at Baidu, Inc. In JIZHI, the inference workflow of every recommendation request is transformed to a Staged Event-Driven Pipeline (SEDP), where each node in the pipeline refers to a staged computation or I/O intensive task processor. With traffics of real-time inference requests arrived, each modularized processor can be run in a fully asynchronized way and managed separately. Besides, JIZHI introduces heterogeneous and hierarchical storage to further accelerate the online inference process by reducing unnecessary computations and potential data access latency induced by ultra-sparse model parameters. Moreover, an intelligent resource manager has been deployed to maximize the throughput of JIZHI over the shared infrastructure by searching the optimal resource allocation plan from historical logs and fine-tuning the load shedding policies over intermediate system feedback. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the advantages of JIZHI from the perspectives of end-to-end service latency, system-wide throughput, and resource consumption. JIZHI has helped Baidu saved more than ten million US dollars in hardware and utility costs while handling 200% more traffics without sacrificing inference efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-03\n\n\n\n#### 5.

However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Mamba-based models, with their superior long-range modeling and linear efficiency, have garnered substantial attention. This study pioneers the application of Mamba to multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection, presenting MambaAD, which consists of a pre-trained encoder and a Mamba decoder featuring (Locality-Enhanced State Space) LSS modules at multi-scales. The proposed LSS module, integrating parallel cascaded (Hybrid State Space) HSS blocks and multi-kernel convolutions operations, effectively captures both long-range and local information. The HSS block, utilizing (Hybrid Scanning) HS encoders, encodes feature maps into five scanning methods and eight directions, thereby strengthening global connections through the (State Space Model) SSM. The use of Hilbert scanning and eight directions significantly improves feature sequence modeling. Comprehensive experiments on six diverse anomaly detection datasets and seven metrics demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, substantiating the method's effectiveness.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-09\n\n\n\n#### 6. SSM-DTA: Breaking the Barriers of Data Scarcity in Drug-Target Affinity Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: \"multi-scale SSM attention\"*\n\n*Rui Yan, Shufang Xie, Tie-Yan Liu, Haiguang Liu, Tao Qin, Yingce Xia, Jinhua Zhu, Lijun Wu, Qizhi Pei*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is of vital importance in early-stage drug discovery, facilitating the identification of drugs that can effectively interact with specific targets and regulate their activities. While wet experiments remain the most reliable method, they are time-consuming and resource-intensive, resulting in limited data availability that poses challenges for deep learning approaches. Existing methods have primarily focused on developing techniques based on the available DTA data, without adequately addressing the data scarcity issue. To overcome this challenge, we present the SSM-DTA framework, which incorporates three simple yet highly effective strategies: (1) A multi-task training approach that combines DTA prediction with masked language modeling (MLM) using paired drug-target data. (2) A semi-supervised training method that leverages large-scale unpaired molecules and proteins to enhance drug and target representations. This approach differs from previous methods that only employed molecules or proteins in pre-training. (3) The integration of a lightweight cross-attention module to improve the interaction between drugs and targets, further enhancing prediction accuracy. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as BindingDB, DAVIS, and KIBA, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework. Additionally, we conduct case studies on specific drug-target binding activities, virtual screening experiments, drug feature visualizations, and real-world applications, all of which showcase the significant potential of our work. In conclusion, our proposed SSM-DTA framework addresses the data limitation challenge in DTA prediction and yields promising results, paving the way for more efficient and accurate drug discovery processes.

However, as the demand for handling longer sequences and more complex dependencies grows, traditional Transformer-based architectures face significant challenges, including quadratic time and space complexity in their attention mechanisms and difficulties in capturing multi-scale dependencies efficiently. State Space Models (SSMs) and Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering linear scaling and enhanced capability in modeling long-range dependencies. Building upon these advancements, our goal is to design a novel GAU block, Mamba3, that incorporates hierarchical attention mechanisms within the SSD (State Space Duality) framework. This integration aims to leverage the strengths of both SSMs and Transformers while mitigating their respective limitations, thereby achieving lower perplexity, higher accuracy on downstream tasks, improved robustness, enhanced efficiency, and excellent scalability.\n\n### Related Work\n\nRecent advancements in sequence modeling have explored the integration of State Space Models (SSMs) with Transformer architectures to enhance performance and efficiency. \n\n- **State Space Duality (SSD) Framework:** Dao and Gu (2024) introduced the SSD framework, establishing a theoretical connection between SSMs and Transformer-based attention mechanisms. This duality facilitates the transfer of optimization techniques from Transformers to SSMs, enabling the design of architectures like Mamba-2, which refine selective SSMs for increased speed and competitiveness.\n  \n- **Gated State Space (GSS) Layers:** Mehta et al. (2022) proposed GSS layers that incorporate gating mechanisms into SSMs, significantly improving training speed and zero-shot generalization to longer sequences. This approach enhances the selective information flow within SSMs, making them more adaptable and efficient.\n  \n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms:** Zheng et al. (2023) introduced Random Feature Attention (RFA), which approximates traditional softmax attention with linear complexity. Similarly, Ren et al. (2023) developed Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) to achieve linear inference complexity while maintaining an infinite attention span.\n  \n- **Hybrid Architectures:** Zuo et al. (2022) presented SPADE, a model that augments Transformers with SSMs to balance global and local dependencies efficiently. This hybrid approach demonstrates improved scalability and performance on benchmarks like Long Range Arena.\n\nThese studies collectively highlight the potential of combining hierarchical structures with SSMs and efficient attention mechanisms to overcome the limitations of traditional Transformer architectures. Mamba3 builds upon these insights by introducing a hierarchical attention mechanism within the GAU framework, further enhancing the model's ability to capture multi-scale dependencies and optimize computational resources.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\nTraditional Transformer-based LMs excel in capturing local and global dependencies through their attention mechanisms but suffer from quadratic time and space complexity relative to sequence length. This limitation becomes prohibitive as models scale to handle longer sequences, leading to inefficiencies in both training and inference. Additionally, Transformers often struggle with modeling multi-scale dependencies effectively, as their single-scale attention mechanism may not capture hierarchical patterns inherent in natural language.\n\nSSMs, on the other hand, offer linear scaling and are adept at modeling long-range dependencies but lack the flexibility to capture complex local interactions. While hierarchical GAUs have been explored, existing implementations do not fully leverage hierarchical attention mechanisms to balance multi-scale dependency modeling and computational efficiency.\n\n**Key Concept:** Integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms within structured state-space models to create a GAU block that can efficiently capture both local and global dependencies, reduce computational complexity, and enhance scalability.\n\n**Mathematical Justification:**\n\nLet \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) be the input sequence, where:\n- \\( B \\) is the batch size.\n- \\( L \\) is the sequence length.\n- \\( D \\) is the embedding dimension.\n\nIn a traditional Transformer GAU, the self-attention mechanism can be represented as:\n\\[\n\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V\n\\]\nwhere \\( Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times H \\times L \\times d_k} \\).\n\nThis results in \\( \\mathcal{O}(L^2) \\) complexity due to the \\( QK^\\top \\) operation.\n\nIn contrast, SSMs operate with linear complexity:\n\\[\nh_t = A(x_t) \\circ h_{t-1} + B(x_t), \\quad y_t = \\phi(h_t, x_t)\n\\]\nwhere \\( A, B \\) are learned functions, \\( \\circ \\) denotes element-wise multiplication, and \\( y_t \\) is the output.\n\nBy integrating hierarchical attention into SSMs within the GAU framework, we aim to maintain linear complexity while effectively modeling multi-scale dependencies. The hierarchical attention allows the model to alternate between different levels of granularity, capturing both fine-grained local interactions and broader global contexts without incurring significant computational overhead.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- **Complexity vs. Efficiency:** Introducing hierarchical attention may add complexity to the GAU block but is designed to maintain overall linear scaling.\n- **Parameter Overhead:** Hierarchical mechanisms may introduce additional parameters; careful design ensures that the parameter growth is manageable.\n- **Implementation Difficulty:** Ensuring efficient implementation of hierarchical attention within the SSM framework requires meticulous engineering to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n### Design Plan\n\n#### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection Mamba2Layer```\n\n#### Modification Overview\n\nWe propose modifying the **Mamba2Layer** GAU by integrating a hierarchical attention mechanism within the State Space Duality (SSD) framework. This integration enables the GAU to capture multi-scale dependencies efficiently while maintaining linear computational complexity. The hierarchical attention will allow the model to process information at varying granularities, enhancing both local and global context understanding.\n\n#### Detailed Modifications\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention Integration:**\n   - **Multi-Level Attention:** Introduce multiple attention layers within the Mamba2Layer, each operating at different scales (e.g., fine, medium, coarse).\n   - **Selective Aggregation:** Implement a gating mechanism to selectively aggregate information from different attention levels based on the input context.\n   \n2. **Structured State Transitions:**\n   - **Dual-State Integration:** Extend the state transitions in the Mamba2Layer to accommodate hierarchical states, ensuring that each attention level has its corresponding state.\n   - **Orthogonal Dynamics:** Design state transitions to be orthogonal across different hierarchical levels, preventing interference and maintaining clear separations between scales.\n   \n3. **Optimized Computational Pathways:**\n   - **Parallel Processing:** Ensure that hierarchical attention layers can process different scales in parallel, leveraging hardware efficiencies.\n   - **Memory-Efficient Representations:** Utilize shared parameters and tensor decompositions to minimize memory overhead introduced by hierarchical structures.\n   \n4. **Enhanced Parameter Initialization:**\n   - **Hierarchical Initialization:** Initialize parameters in a way that facilitates stable training across multiple attention levels, drawing inspiration from HiPPO matrices for state-space models.\n\n#### Mathematical Formulations and Theoretical Justifications\n\n**Hierarchical Attention Mechanism:**\n\nLet \\( Q_i, K_i, V_i \\) represent queries, keys, and values at attention level \\( i \\), where \\( i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\) corresponds to fine, medium, and coarse scales respectively.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Attention}_i(Q_i, K_i, V_i) &= \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_i K_i^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V_i \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n**Selective Aggregation:**\n\nIntroduce gating functions \\( G_i \\) that modulate the contribution of each attention level to the final output.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Output} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} G_i \\cdot \\text{Attention}_i(Q_i, K_i, V_i)\n\\]\n\nWhere \\( G_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times H \\times L \\times d_k} \\) is computed as:\n\n\\[\nG_i = \\sigma(W_i [\\text{Attention}_i(Q_i, K_i, V_i), h_{i}])\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( W_i \\) are learnable parameters and \\( h_{i} \\) are hierarchical states.\n\n**Structured State Transitions:**\n\nExtend the state transition equations to handle hierarchical states:\n\n\\[\nh_{i,t} = A_i(x_t) \\circ h_{i,t-1} + B_i(x_t)\n\\]\n\\[\ny_t = \\phi\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} G_i \\cdot \\text{Attention}_i(Q_i, K_i, V_i), x_t\\right)\n\\]\n\n**Theoretical Justification:**\n\nThe hierarchical attention allows the model to dynamically adjust the granularity of information processing based on the input context. By maintaining separate states for each attention level, the model can efficiently capture and integrate multi-scale dependencies without significantly increasing computational complexity. The selective aggregation via gating mechanisms ensures that only relevant information from each scale is utilized, enhancing the model's ability to generalize and maintain robustness across varied input sequences.\n\n### Implementation Guidelines\n\n#### Pseudo-Code for Modified Mamba2Layer GAU\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom einops import rearrange, repeat\n\nclass HierarchicalAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, head_dim, num_scales=3):\n        super(HierarchicalAttention, self).__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.head_dim = head_dim\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        \n        #

This design effectively captures multi-scale dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, addressing the key challenges faced by traditional Transformer-based models. By enhancing the Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) with hierarchical structures and optimized state transitions, Mamba3 is poised to deliver lower perplexity on large corpora, improved accuracy on downstream tasks, robust performance across varied inputs, and superior efficiency and scalability during training and inference. These improvements position Mamba3 as a competitive and innovative solution in the landscape of modern language modeling.\n\n### References\n\n- Dao, T., & Gu, A.
