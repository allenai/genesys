Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 3. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 0.68)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4. Nystr\u00f6mformer: A nystr\u00f6m-based algorithm for approximating self-attention (Avg. Score: 0.50)\n\n*Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, G. Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Interpretable and Generalizable Graph Learning via Stochastic Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Siqi Miao, Miaoyuan Liu, Pan Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stoChasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation.\n\n**Abstract:** Interpretable graph learning is in need as many scientific applications depend on learning models to collect insights from graph-structured data. Previous works mostly focused on using post-hoc approaches to interpret pre-trained models (graph neural networks in particular). They argue against inherently interpretable models because the good interpretability of these models is often at the cost of their prediction accuracy. However, those post-hoc methods often fail to provide stable interpretation and may extract features that are spuriously correlated with the task. In this work, we address these issues by proposing Graph Stochastic Attention (GSAT). Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stochasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation. The selected subgraphs provably do not contain patterns that are spuriously correlated with the task under some assumptions. Extensive experiments on eight datasets show that GSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 20%$\\uparrow$ in interpretation AUC and 5%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy.

Generating Descriptions from Structured Data Using a Bifocal Attention Mechanism and Gated Orthogonalization\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Preksha Nema, Shreyas Shetty, Parag Jain, Anirban Laha, Karthik Sankaranarayanan, Mitesh M. Khapra*\n\n**TL;DR:** A fused bifocal attention mechanism which exploits and combines this micro and macro level information and a gated orthogonalization mechanism which tries to ensure that a field is remembered for a few time steps and then forgotten are used.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we focus on the task of generating natural language descriptions from a structured table of facts containing fields (such as nationality, occupation, etc) and values (such as Indian, actor, director, etc). One simple choice is to treat the table as a sequence of fields and values and then use a standard seq2seq model for this task. However, such a model is too generic and does not exploit task specific characteristics. For example, while generating descriptions from a table, a human would attend to information at two levels: (i) the fields (macro level) and (ii) the values within the field (micro level). Further, a human would continue attending to a field for a few timesteps till all the information from that field has been rendered and then never return back to this field (because there is nothing left to say about it). To capture this behavior we use (i) a fused bifocal attention mechanism which exploits and combines this micro and macro level information and (ii) a gated orthogonalization mechanism which tries to ensure that a field is remembered for a few time steps and then forgotten. We experiment with a recently released dataset which contains fact tables about people and their corresponding one line biographical descriptions in English. In addition, we also introduce two similar datasets for French and German. Our experiments show that the proposed model gives 21% relative improvement over a recently proposed state of the art method and 10% relative improvement over basic seq2seq models.

Breaking the Language Barrier: Improving Cross-Lingual Reasoning with Structured Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Negar Foroutan, Mohammadreza Banaei, Karl Aberer, Antoine Bosselut*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel attention mechanism is proposed that uses a dedicated set of parameters to encourage cross-lingual attention in code-switched sequences, which improves the reasoning performance by up to 14% and 4% on the RuleTaker and LeapOfThought datasets, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we study whether multilingual language models (MultiLMs) can transfer logical reasoning abilities to other languages when they are fine-tuned for reasoning in a different language. We evaluate the cross-lingual reasoning abilities of MultiLMs in two schemes: (1) where the language of the context and the question remain the same in the new languages that are tested (i.e., the reasoning is still monolingual, but the model must transfer the learned reasoning ability across languages), and (2) where the language of the context and the question is different (which we term code-switched reasoning). On two logical reasoning datasets, RuleTaker and LeapOfThought, we demonstrate that although MultiLMs can transfer reasoning ability across languages in a monolingual setting, they struggle to transfer reasoning abilities in a code-switched setting. Following this observation, we propose a novel attention mechanism that uses a dedicated set of parameters to encourage cross-lingual attention in code-switched sequences, which improves the reasoning performance by up to 14% and 4% on the RuleTaker and LeapOfThought datasets, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Takeru Miyato, Bernhard Jaeger, Max Welling, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work argues that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure, and proposes a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Inheritune: Training Smaller Yet More Attentive Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Sujay Sanghavi, Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, Alexandros G. Dimakis, Sunny Sanyal*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks, primarily due to the transformer architecture and its self-attention mechanism. However, we observe that in standard decoder-style LLMs, attention matrices degenerate to single-column for deeper layers. Layers in this state are unable to learn anything meaningful and mostly redundant; we refer to these as lazy layers. The goal of this paper is to train smaller models by eliminating this structural inefficiency without compromising performance. Motivated by this observation, we propose Inheritune, a simple yet effective training recipe for developing smaller, high-performing language models. Smaller models trained with Inheritune, inherit early transformer layers from a larger pre-trained model, then retrain and progressively expand until they match or exceed the performance of the larger model. We demonstrate that Inheritune enables the training of various sizes of GPT-2 models on datasets like OpenWebText-9B and FineWeb_edu. Models trained with Inheritune, despite having significantly fewer layers, match or even surpass the performance of their larger counterparts. For instance, our 16-layer GPT-2 medium variant achieves comparable performance to the standard 24-layer GPT-2 medium model.

Graph Optimal Transport for Cross-Domain Alignment\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Lawrence Carin, Yu Cheng, Liqun Chen, Linjie Li, Jingjing Liu, Zhe Gan*\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-domain alignment between two sets of entities (e.g., objects in an image, words in a sentence) is fundamental to both computer vision and natural language processing. Existing methods mainly focus on designing advanced attention mechanisms to simulate soft alignment, with no training signals to explicitly encourage alignment. The learned attention matrices are also dense and lacks interpretability. We propose Graph Optimal Transport (GOT), a principled framework that germinates from recent advances in Optimal Transport (OT). In GOT, cross-domain alignment is formulated as a graph matching problem, by representing entities into a dynamically-constructed graph. Two types of OT distances are considered: (i) Wasserstein distance (WD) for node (entity) matching; and (ii) Gromov-Wasserstein distance (GWD) for edge (structure) matching. Both WD and GWD can be incorporated into existing neural network models, effectively acting as a drop-in regularizer. The inferred transport plan also yields sparse and self-normalized alignment, enhancing the interpretability of the learned model. Experiments show consistent outperformance of GOT over baselines across a wide range of tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, image captioning, machine translation, and text summarization.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Numerical Weather Forecasting using Convolutional-LSTM with Attention and Context Matcher Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices attention mechanism*\n\n*Suleyman Serdar Kozat, Arda Fazla, Selim Furkan Tekin*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerical weather forecasting using high-resolution physical models often requires extensive computational resources on supercomputers, which diminishes their wide usage in most real-life applications. As a remedy, applying deep learning methods has revealed innovative solutions within this field. To this end, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture for forecasting high-resolution spatio-temporal weather data. Our approach extends the conventional encoder-decoder structure by integrating Convolutional Long-short Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks. In addition, we incorporate attention and context matcher mechanisms into the model architecture. Our Weather Model achieves significant performance improvements compared to baseline deep learning models, including ConvLSTM, TrajGRU, and U-Net. Our experimental evaluation involves high-scale, real-world benchmark numerical weather datasets, namely the ERA5 hourly dataset on pressure levels and WeatherBench. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in identifying spatial and temporal correlations with attention matrices focusing on distinct parts of the input series to model atmospheric circulations. We also compare our model with high-resolution physical models using the benchmark metrics and show that our Weather Model is accurate and easy to interpret.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on structured matrix approaches for attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and references that can be beneficial:\n\n## Structured State Space Dual Matrices\n\nThe paper \"More Efficient and Effective Architecture for Language Modeling Tasks\" introduces the use of structured state space dual matrices to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of attention mechanisms. This approach involves:\n\n- Using rotation position encoding matrices as part of the structured state space dual matrix to improve positional encoding.\n- Incorporating selective state space algorithms as inner functions within the causal self-attention matrix to filter information efficiently. This method helps in maintaining a constant state size, reducing the computational overhead associated with long sequences.\n\n## Sub-Quadratic Attention Mechanisms\n\nThe \"Monarch Mixer\" architecture is another promising direction. It uses Monarch matrices, which achieve sub-quadratic scaling in both sequence length and model dimension. This approach:\n\n- Utilizes butterfly factorization for efficient computation, matching the quality of traditional transformers without the need for conventional attention or MLPs.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\nThe traditional self-attention mechanism, while powerful, can be computationally expensive. Alternatives include:\n\n- **Linear Attention**: This method discards the softmax operation by folding it into the kernel feature map, using kernel properties of matrix multiplication. For causal attention, this can be expanded into a recursive form, improving efficiency.\n- **Inner Function Attention**: This approach uses selective state space algorithms as inner functions to enhance the expressiveness of the hidden state without significantly increasing computational costs. It retains the explicit storage of historical context information while improving efficiency on long sequences.\n\n## Multi-Head Attention Enhancements\n\nWhile multi-head attention is a cornerstone of transformer architectures, it can be enhanced for better efficiency and performance:\n\n- **Multi-Head Attention with Structured Matrices**: Combining multi-head attention with structured matrix approaches can allow the model to capture diverse information from different representation subspaces efficiently. This can be achieved by projecting Q, K, and V vectors into multiple subspaces and then concatenating the outputs.\n\n## Positional Encoding and Masking\n\nEfficient positional encoding methods are crucial for autoregressive models. The use of:\n\n- **Rotation Position Encoding**: This method has been verified to be effective in both selective state space algorithms and quadratic self-attention algorithms, improving the model's performance on language modeling tasks.\n- **Masking**: Ensuring that the model attends to tokens in an autoregressive manner is critical. Masking future tokens during training helps enforce this behavior, which is essential for sequential text generation.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures and Efficiency Techniques\n\nExploring hybrid architectures that combine different efficiency techniques can lead to significant improvements:\n\n- **Combining N-gram-like Structures**: Augmenting transformers with latent n-grams can capture local patterns efficiently, combining traditional n-gram insights with modern neural approaches[Analysis Note].\n- **Efficient Normalization Techniques**: Optimizing normalization techniques, such as RMSNorm, for better memory efficiency can also contribute to overall model efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these structured matrix approaches, sub-quadratic attention mechanisms, and efficient positional encoding and masking techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and effective autoregressive language models that scale better and perform robustly across various sequence lengths.\n",

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/35 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: structured matrices MLP implementation efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2. Efficient Recurrent Neural Networks using Structured Matrices in FPGAs\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices MLP implementation efficiency*\n\n*Zhe Li, Shuo Wang, Caiwen Ding, Qinru Qiu, Yanzhi Wang, Yun Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes block-circulant matrices for weight matrix representation in RNNs, thereby achieving simultaneous model compression and acceleration in FPGA and achieves a maximum energy efficiency improvement compared with ESE.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are becoming increasingly important for time series-related applications which require efficient and real-time implementations. The recent pruning based work ESE suffers from degradation of performance/energy efficiency due to the irregular network structure after pruning. We propose block-circulant matrices for weight matrix representation in RNNs, thereby achieving simultaneous model compression and acceleration. We aim to implement RNNs in FPGA with highest performance and energy efficiency, with certain accuracy requirement (negligible accuracy degradation). Experimental results on actual FPGA deployments shows that the proposed framework achieves a maximum energy efficiency improvement of 35.7$\\times$ compared with ESE.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices MLP implementation efficiency*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices MLP implementation efficiency*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Pruning Large Language Models to Intra-module Low-rank Architecture with Transitional Activations\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices MLP implementation efficiency*\n\n*Bowen Shen, Zheng Lin, Daren Zha, Wei Liu, Jian Luan, Bin Wang, Weiping Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design that reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning fundamentally reduces computational and memory overheads of large language models (LLMs) and offers a feasible solution for end-side LLM deployment. Structurally pruned models remain dense and high-precision, highly compatible with further tuning and compression. However, as the coarse-grained structured pruning poses large damage to the highly interconnected model, achieving a high compression ratio for scaled-up LLMs remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic structured pruning approach coupled with a compact Transformer architecture design. The proposed approach, named TransAct, reduces transitional activations inside multi-head attention (MHA) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) modules, while preserving the inter-module activations that are sensitive to perturbations. Hence, the LLM is pruned into an intra-module low-rank architecture, significantly reducing weights, KV Cache and attention computation. TransAct is implemented on the LLaMA model and evaluated on downstream benchmarks. Results verify the optimality of our approach at high compression with respect to both efficiency and performance. Further, ablation studies reveal the strength of activation-guided iterative pruning and provide experimental analysis on the redundancy of MHA and MLP modules.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design with a focus on efficient implementations of structured matrices in MLPs and neural networks, here are some relevant findings and discussions from the provided sources:\n\n## Efficient Hardware Implementations\n\n### Approximate Computing in MLPs\nThe paper on \"Dynamic Power Control in a Hardware Neural Network with Error and Power Controllable Approximate Multipliers\" discusses efficient hardware implementations of MLPs using approximate computing techniques.

The results show a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts, along with improved power efficiency and latency. This approach is highly relevant for practical implementations aiming to enhance hardware efficiency.\n\n## Practical Implementations and Techniques\n\n### Quantization Techniques\nThe discussion on \"Neural Networks Implementations In C++\" includes quantization techniques that can be applied to optimize neural network performance. Quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization are methods that can reduce model size and improve efficiency without significant loss in accuracy.

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg.

However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nE.

Joint Edge-Model Sparse Learning is Provably Efficient for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Shuai Zhang, M. Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Sijia Liu, Songtao Lu, Miaoyuan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error and proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexityand improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the significant computational challenge of training large-scale graph neural networks (GNNs), various sparse learning techniques have been exploited to reduce memory and storage costs. Examples include \\textit{graph sparsification} that samples a subgraph to reduce the amount of data aggregation and \\textit{model sparsification} that prunes the neural network to reduce the number of trainable weights. Despite the empirical successes in reducing the training cost while maintaining the test accuracy, the theoretical generalization analysis of sparse learning for GNNs remains elusive. To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first theoretical characterization of joint edge-model sparse learning from the perspective of sample complexity and convergence rate in achieving zero generalization error. It proves analytically that both sampling important nodes and pruning neurons with the lowest-magnitude can reduce the sample complexity and improve convergence without compromising the test accuracy. Although the analysis is centered on two-layer GNNs with structural constraints on data, the insights are applicable to more general setups and justified by both synthetic and practical citation datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Learning to Linearize Deep Neural Networks for Secure and Efficient Private Inference\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Souvik Kundu, Shun Lu, Yuke Zhang, Jacqueline Liu, P. Beerel*\n\n**TL;DR:** SENet is presented, a three-stage training method that for a given ReLU budget, automatically assigns per-layer ReLU counts, decides the ReLU locations for each layer's activation map, and trains a model with significantly fewer ReLUs to potentially yield latency and communication efficient PI.\n\n**Abstract:** The large number of ReLU non-linearity operations in existing deep neural networks makes them ill-suited for latency-efficient private inference (PI). Existing techniques to reduce ReLU operations often involve manual effort and sacrifice significant accuracy. In this paper, we first present a novel measure of non-linearity layers' ReLU sensitivity, enabling mitigation of the time-consuming manual efforts in identifying the same. Based on this sensitivity, we then present SENet, a three-stage training method that for a given ReLU budget, automatically assigns per-layer ReLU counts, decides the ReLU locations for each layer's activation map, and trains a model with significantly fewer ReLUs to potentially yield latency and communication efficient PI. Experimental evaluations with multiple models on various datasets show SENet's superior performance both in terms of reduced ReLUs and improved classification accuracy compared to existing alternatives. In particular, SENet can yield models that require up to ~2x fewer ReLUs while yielding similar accuracy. For a similar ReLU budget SENet can yield models with ~2.32% improved classification accuracy, evaluated on CIFAR-100.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. LST: Ladder Side-Tuning for Parameter and Memory Efficient Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Yi-Lin Sung, Jaemin Cho, Mohit Bansal*\n\n**TL;DR:** LST has significantly lower memory requirements than previous methods, because it does not require backpropagation through the backbone network, but instead only through the side network and ladder connections, and achieves higher accuracy than Adapter and LoRA in a low-memory regime.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pre-trained models on downstream tasks has been adopted in a variety of domains recently. However, it is costly to update the entire parameter set of large pre-trained models. Although recently proposed parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) techniques allow updating a small subset of parameters (e.g. only using 2% of parameters) inside a pre-trained backbone network for a new task, they only reduce the training memory requirement by up to 30%. This is because the gradient computation for the trainable parameters still requires backpropagation through the large pre-trained backbone model. To address this, we propose Ladder Side-Tuning (LST), a new PETL technique that can reduce training memory requirements by more substantial amounts. Unlike existing parameter-efficient methods that insert additional parameters inside backbone networks, we train a ladder side network, a small and separate network that takes intermediate activations as input via shortcut connections (called ladders) from backbone networks and makes predictions. LST has significantly lower memory requirements than previous methods, because it does not require backpropagation through the backbone network, but instead only through the side network and ladder connections. We evaluate our method with various models (T5 and CLIP-T5) on both NLP (GLUE) and vision-and-language (VQA, GQA, NLVR2 , MSCOCO) tasks. LST saves 69% of the memory costs to fine-tune the whole network, while other methods only save 26% of that in similar parameter usages (hence, 2.7x more memory savings). Moreover, LST achieves higher accuracy than Adapter and LoRA in a low-memory regime. To further show the advantage of this better memory efficiency, we also apply LST to larger T5 models, attaining better GLUE performance than full fine-tuning and other PETL methods. The accuracy-efficiency trade-off also holds on VL tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 176  (*Influential: 27*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Real-Time Super-Resolution System of 4K-Video Based on Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*He Li, Yongming Tang, Changjun Song, Chengcheng Wang, Yanpeng Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video super-resolution (VSR) technology excels in reconstructing low-quality video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

KNEEL: Knee Anatomical Landmark Localization Using Hourglass Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Iaroslav Melekhov, Simo Saarakkala, Aleksei Tiulpin*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of localization of anatomical landmarks in knee X-ray images at different stages of osteoarthritis (OA). Landmark localization can be viewed as regression problem, where the landmark position is directly predicted by using the region of interest or even full-size images leading to large memory footprint, especially in case of high resolution medical images. In this work, we propose an efficient deep neural networks framework with an hourglass architecture utilizing a soft-argmax layer to directly predict normalized coordinates of the landmark points. We provide an extensive evaluation of different regularization techniques and various loss functions to understand their influence on the localization performance. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of transfer learning from low-budget annotations, and experimentally demonstrate that such approach is improving the accuracy of landmark localization. Compared to the prior methods, we validate our model on two datasets that are independent from the train data and assess the performance of the method for different stages of OA severity. The proposed approach demonstrates better generalization performance compared to the current state-of-the-art.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization techniques neural networks*\n\n*Yun Fu, Can Qin, Huan Wang, Yulun Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) networks have obtained promising results with moderate model size. Many SR methods have focused on designing lightweight architectures, which neglect to further reduce the redundancy of network parameters. On the other hand, model compression techniques, like neural architecture search and knowledge distillation, typically consume considerable memory and computation resources. In contrast, network pruning is a cheap and effective model compression technique. However, it is hard to be applied to SR networks directly, because filter pruning for residual blocks is well-known tricky. To address the above issues, we propose aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies $L_2$ regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity. To align the pruned locations across different layers, we propose a \\emph{sparsity structure alignment} penalty term, which minimizes the norm of soft mask gram matrix. We apply aligned structured sparsity learning strategy to train efficient image SR network, named as ASSLN, with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods. We conduct extensive comparisons with lightweight SR networks. Our ASSLN achieves superior performance gains over recent methods quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design with a focus on memory-efficient normalization techniques, here are some relevant insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Batch Normalization and Its Variants\n\nBatch Normalization (BatchNorm) is a widely used technique to stabilize the learning process in deep neural networks. However, traditional BatchNorm can be memory-intensive and may not be optimal for all scenarios.\n\n- **In-Memory Batch Normalization**: The paper on \"A Variation-Aware Binary Neural Network Framework\" discusses in-memory batch normalization, which can be more efficient in certain hardware contexts. This approach optimizes the biasing voltages of word lines and bit lines in SRAM to balance accuracy and power consumption, which could be adapted for more general neural network architectures.\n\n## Sparse Neural Networks and Gradient Flow\n\nSparse neural networks can offer significant memory and computational efficiency without compromising much on performance.\n\n- **Sparse Neural Networks**: These networks remove unnecessary parts and connections, resulting in a more efficient and leaner model. This approach can help in reducing memory usage and improving training speed, which is crucial for large autoregressive LMs.\n\n## Compressed Activations\n\nCompressing activations during the training process can significantly reduce memory usage.\n\n- **CompAct: Compressed Activations**: This technique involves storing low-rank, compressed activations for the backward pass, which reduces peak memory utilization by 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). This method avoids additional memory overheads by using random projection matrices.\n\n## Alternative Normalization Techniques\n\nBesides traditional BatchNorm, there are other normalization techniques that can be more memory-efficient.\n\n- **Layer Normalization Alternatives**: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, other normalization techniques like Instance Normalization, Group Normalization, or even simpler normalization methods like RMSNorm can be more memory-efficient and might be suitable alternatives depending on the specific architecture and requirements of the autoregressive LM.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\nHardware-efficient implementations can also play a crucial role in reducing memory footprint and improving efficiency.\n\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing can perform matrix operations more efficiently, reducing power consumption and latency. This can be particularly beneficial for the self-attention mechanisms in transformer-based LMs.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo improve autoregressive LM design with a focus on memory-efficient normalization techniques:\n\n- **Use in-memory batch normalization** or other optimized normalization techniques that are tailored for specific hardware contexts.\n- **Employ sparse neural networks** to reduce unnecessary connections and improve efficiency.\n- **Implement compressed activations** like CompAct to reduce memory usage during training.\n- **Consider alternative normalization techniques** that might offer better memory efficiency.\n- **Leverage hardware-efficient implementations**, such as memristor-based accelerators, to optimize matrix operations.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving better performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Auto-NBA: Efficient and Effective Search Over the Joint Space of Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhang, David Cox, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators.\n\n**Abstract:** While maximizing deep neural networks' (DNNs') acceleration efficiency requires a joint search/design of three different yet highly coupled aspects, including the networks, bitwidths, and accelerators, the challenges associated with such a joint search have not yet been fully understood and addressed. The key challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory consumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the discrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different from that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem associated with network-accelerator co-search, i.e., co-search requires operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal accelerator depending on the whole network is still unknown during search. To tackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN accelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each target dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators consistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including co-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN accelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator efficiency.

PackQViT: Faster Sub-8-bit Vision Transformers via Full and Packed Quantization on the Mobile\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Peiyan Dong, Lei Lu, Chao Wu, Cheng Lyu, Geng Yuan, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making and develops a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT Acceleration on mobile phones.\n\n**Abstract:** While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have undoubtedly made impressive strides in computer vision (CV), their intricate network structures necessitate substantial computation and memory resources. A decision-making process for CV tasks typically entails performing computations with low latency, which is a tricky problem for ViT models. Model quantization is a widely-used technique to optimize the hardware ef\ufb01ciency of deep neural networks. Full quantization under Sub-8-bit precision, in particular, is a promising solution to reduce inference latency significantly. Unfortunately, current commodity hardware, such as CPUs and GPUs, still struggles to ef\ufb01ciently execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks, as their SIMD instructions only support a granularity of 8 bits or wider. Also, there is a scarcity of literature that presents a full quantization paradigm for ViTs. In this paper, we propose an activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making. Speci\ufb01cally, in revisiting data activation within the ViT data\ufb02ow, two characteristics are relevant to quantization strategy and precision: the long-tailed distribution and systematic channel-wise outliers. In response, we employ either log2 quantization or clipping to address the long-tailed distribution and incorporate outlier-aware training for residual link quantization to regulate the various channel-wise outliers more consistently. Notably, due to the systematic \ufb01xed pattern, outlier-aware training approach can predict the channel indices and regularized scales of outliers in advance, thus avoiding the runtime data-adaptive selection during inference. Furthermore, we employ Int-2 n -Softmax, Int-LayerNorm, and Integer GELU to enable integer-only computation \ufb02ow. Finally, we develop a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT acceleration on mobile phones. Compared to prior studies on ViT quantization using 8-bit precision, PackQViT surpasses other works by an improved accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 17.9% for various widely used ViTs on ImageNet dataset; under 4-bit precision, PackQViT demonstrates 0.4% \u21e0 2.8% higher accuracy. Compared to the baseline multiplier, our implementations on the Realme GT Android smartphone with Snapdragon 870 SoC CPU achieve 2 . 6 \u21e5\u21e0 3 . 7 \u21e5 speedup under 8-bit scenario and 3 . 8 \u21e5\u21e0 5 . 9 \u21e5 speedup under 4-bit which ensures practical real-time performance.

Revisiting Structured Variational Autoencoders\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Yixiu Zhao, Scott W. Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** By exploiting structure in the prior, the SVAE learns more accurate models and posterior distributions, which translate into improved performance on prediction tasks, and this ability to develop a novel, self-supervised training approach is leveraged.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured variational autoencoders (SVAEs) combine probabilistic graphical model priors on latent variables, deep neural networks to link latent variables to observed data, and structure-exploiting algorithms for approximate posterior inference. These models are particularly appealing for sequential data, where the prior can capture temporal dependencies. However, despite their conceptual elegance, SVAEs have proven difficult to implement, and more general approaches have been favored in practice. Here, we revisit SVAEs using modern machine learning tools and demonstrate their advantages over more general alternatives in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. First, we develop a modern implementation for hardware acceleration, parallelization, and automatic differentiation of the message passing algorithms at the core of the SVAE. Second, we show that by exploiting structure in the prior, the SVAE learns more accurate models and posterior distributions, which translate into improved performance on prediction tasks. Third, we show how the SVAE can naturally handle missing data, and we leverage this ability to develop a novel, self-supervised training approach. Altogether, these results show that the time is ripe to revisit structured variational autoencoders.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Stacked Filters Stationary Flow For Hardware-Oriented Acceleration Of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Yuechao Gao, Nianhong Liu, Shenmin Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A computation flow, stacked filters stationary flow (SFS), and a corresponding data encoding format, relative indexed compressed sparse filter format (CSF), to make the best of data sparsity, and simplify data handling at execution time is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** To address memory and computation resource limitations for hardware-oriented acceleration of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we present a computation flow, stacked filters stationary flow (SFS), and a corresponding data encoding format, relative indexed compressed sparse filter format (CSF), to make the best of data sparsity, and simplify data handling at execution time.

Comparing with the state-of-the-art result (Han et al., 2016b), our methods achieve 1.11x improvement in reducing the storage required by AlexNet, and 1.09x improvement in reducing the storage required by SqueezeNet, without loss of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, using these approaches, chip area for logics handling irregular sparse data access can be saved.

In particular, during backward pass, parameter gradients are\nstochastically quantized to low bitwidth numbers before being propagated to\nconvolutional layers. As convolutions during forward/backward passes can now\noperate on low bitwidth weights and activations/gradients respectively,\nDoReFa-Net can use bit convolution kernels to accelerate both training and\ninference.

Improving Neural Network Quantization without Retraining using Outlier Channel Splitting\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Yuwei Hu, Ritchie Zhao, Jordan Dotzel, Zhiru Zhang, Christopher De Sa*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization can improve the execution latency and energy efficiency of neural networks on both commodity GPUs and specialized accelerators. The majority of existing literature focuses on training quantized DNNs, while this work examines the less-studied topic of quantizing a floating-point model without (re)training. DNN weights and activations follow a bell-shaped distribution post-training, while practical hardware uses a linear quantization grid. This leads to challenges in dealing with outliers in the distribution. Prior work has addressed this by clipping the outliers or using specialized hardware. In this work, we propose outlier channel splitting (OCS), which duplicates channels containing outliers, then halves the channel values. The network remains functionally identical, but affected outliers are moved toward the center of the distribution. OCS requires no additional training and works on commodity hardware. Experimental evaluation on ImageNet classification and language modeling shows that OCS can outperform state-of-the-art clipping techniques with only minor overhead.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Ristretto: Hardware-Oriented Approximation of Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Philipp Gysel*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved major breakthroughs in\nrecent years. Their performance in computer vision have matched and in some\nareas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capture\ncomplex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high\ncomputational and memory requirements. State-of-art networks require billions\nof arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devices\nsuch as smartphones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing\npower of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease\nboth execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast\nconnection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important,\ncomputation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep\nneural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of\naccelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which\nenables energy-efficient inference. We present Ristretto, a fast and automated\nframework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic of\na custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network\nparameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area\nfor multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the\nneed for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The\ntool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Since\ntraining of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly\noptimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any\ngiven network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully\ncondense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using hardware acceleration techniques, focusing on memory bandwidth optimization and efficient computation patterns, here are some key points and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n## Memory Bandwidth Optimization\n\n### High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM)\nUsing high-bandwidth memory (HBM) is crucial for optimizing memory bandwidth in AI accelerators. HBM technologies, such as HBM2E and the upcoming HBM3, offer significantly higher bandwidth compared to traditional DRAM solutions. For instance, Nvidia's A100 GPU uses HBM2E to achieve 2 TB/s of memory bandwidth, which is essential for training large AI models efficiently.\n\n### Specialized Memory Architectures\nCompanies like Graphcore and Cerebras have developed specialized memory architectures to optimize memory bandwidth. Graphcore's second-generation IPU uses large on-chip SRAM to support high memory bandwidth, avoiding the need for high-bandwidth off-chip DRAM. Cerebras's MemoryX technology streamlines data transfer by separating memory from compute and optimizing communication between them.\n\n## Efficient Computation Patterns\n\n### Parallelization and Specialized Hardware\nHardware implementations such as FPGAs and ASICs can be designed to highly parallelize computations like matrix multiplications and convolutions, which are common in neural networks. This parallelization leads to significant performance improvements over general-purpose CPUs and can be tailored to reduce redundant operations and memory accesses, resulting in lower power consumption and latency.\n\n### Approximate Computing Techniques\nApproximate computing techniques can enhance the efficiency of neural networks by reducing hardware area and power consumption. By incorporating approximate multipliers with configurable error and power in the multiply-accumulate (MAC) units of neurons, researchers can achieve substantial power savings while maintaining reasonable accuracy. This approach is particularly beneficial for applications with inherent resilience to faults, such as image processing and neural networks.\n\n## Automated Inference Partitioning\n\n### Hardware-Aware Layer Scheduling\nAutomated inference partitioning frameworks can optimize the performance of DNNs by finding beneficial partitioning points based on system metrics like accuracy, memory utilization, and energy efficiency. These frameworks use graph-based algorithms to evaluate potential partitioning points and ensure that the memory requirements do not exceed the available on-chip memory, thereby optimizing throughput and energy efficiency.\n\n## Integration with Structured Computation and Normalization\n\n### Combining Structured Matrices with Efficient Normalization\nWhile the references provided do not directly discuss combining structured matrices with efficient normalization in the context of hardware acceleration, the principles of structured computation (e.g., using Monarch matrices) and efficient normalization (e.g., progressive replacement of LayerNorm with BatchNorm) can be integrated with hardware-aware design optimizations. For instance, designing hardware accelerators that support structured matrices and efficient normalization strategies can lead to significant efficiency gains in both computation and memory usage.\n\nBy leveraging these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of computation but also optimized for memory bandwidth, leading to better overall performance, scalability, and robustness.\n",

Summary of Analysis:**\n\nAfter conducting thorough research across multiple rounds, we have evaluated the proposal for **HardwareEfficientMHA**, which aims to enhance Multi-Head Attention (MHA) in language models by integrating butterfly factorization, hardware-aware memory access patterns, quantization, and IO-aware algorithms. The key objectives are to achieve significant improvements in computational and memory efficiency while maintaining or improving model performance.\n\nOur investigation indicates that while there is considerable research on using structured matrices and hardware optimizations in attention mechanisms, the direct application of butterfly factorization to MHA for hardware efficiency appears to be relatively novel. Existing works have employed butterfly factorization in other contexts, such as efficient linear transforms and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, but not specifically within MHA for language models.\n\nThe proposal's integration of butterfly factorization with hardware-aware optimizations and quantization presents a unique combination that aligns with current research trends but seems to offer a new direction in improving attention mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**2.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIts effectiveness has been extensively validated. The approach involves using tiling strategies to minimize the amount of memory reads/writes between the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. ## 8. Conclusion and Limitations\n\nWe presented CHELA for robust and efficient modeling of long sequences. CHELA is an SSM-attention hybrid architecture that computes both structured and data-dependent patterns in linear time with respect to sequence length. Its superior performance is enabled by considering the global view of the Short-Long Convolutions and real linear\n\nHardware-Efficient Linear Attention with gating mechanisms. Compared to other hybrid linear models, we are currently the first to achieve performance improvement while maintaining linear complexity. Our large-scale and diverse experiments demonstrate that CHELA is an efficient and flexible long sequence model with excellent performance on image, text, logical reasoning, and speech data. However, CHELA also has some limitations. The optimal combinations of short convolutions are not explored in this paper, which should be a future research direction of designing dynamic short-convolutional components according to the input data. Moreover, the time-varying SSM is a different idea to achieve this goal. By embracing CHELA as a starting point in the integration of hardware-efficient implementation into hybrid models, we are taking the initial step towards achieving greater efficiency gains in the future. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (No. 2021YFA1301603), National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (No. U21A20427), Project (No. WU2022A009) from the Center of Synthetic Biology and Integrated Bioengineering of Westlake University and Project (No. WU2023C019) from the Westlake University Industries of the Future Research Funding.

We thank the AI Station of Westlake University for the support of GPUs. ## Impact Statement\n\nThe goal of this paper is to advance research in longsequence modeling by introducing an efficient model design CHELA. We have considered broader ethical impacts and do not foresee CHELA directly leading to negative societal consequences. All datasets and models used are existing public resources that do not contain private or sensitive information. Through discussing the hybrid design of linear attention and SSM models, we aim to make sequence mixers much more efficient by fully leveraging hardware and different model features. Besides, as the community proposes new methods, we encourage discussing any potential negative impacts early in the research process. Overall, we believe hardware-efficient style and the combination of structured and data-dependent patterns are the dominant trends of the future for efficient sequence modeling. ## References\n\nAinslie, J., Ontanon, S., Alberti, C., Cvicek, V., Fisher, Z., Pham, P., Ravula, A., Sanghai, S., Wang, Q., and Yang, L.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly Factorization Attention*\n\n*Weiyang Liu, Zeju Qiu, Yao Feng, Yuliang Xiu, Yuxuan Xue, Longhui Yu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Juyeon Heo, Songyou Peng, Yandong Wen, Michael J. Black, Adrian Weller, Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures is proposed, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT).\n\n**Abstract:** Large foundation models are becoming ubiquitous, but training them from scratch is prohibitively expensive. Thus, efficiently adapting these powerful models to downstream tasks is increasingly important. In this paper, we study a principled finetuning paradigm -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) -- for downstream task adaptation. Despite demonstrating good generalizability, OFT still uses a fairly large number of trainable parameters due to the high dimensionality of orthogonal matrices. To address this, we start by examining OFT from an information transmission perspective, and then identify a few key desiderata that enable better parameter-efficiency. Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, we propose an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures. We apply this parameterization to OFT, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT). By subsuming OFT as a special case, BOFT introduces a generalized orthogonal finetuning framework. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical study of adapting large vision transformers, large language models, and text-to-image diffusion models to various downstream tasks in vision and language.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Look Ma, No Hands! Agent-Environment Factorization of Egocentric Videos\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly Factorization Attention*\n\n*Matthew Chang, Aditya Prakash, Saurabh Gupta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to extract a factored representation of the scene that separates the agent (human hand) and the environment, which alleviates both occlusion and mismatch while preserving the signal, thereby easing the design of models for downstream robotics tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The analysis and use of egocentric videos for robotic tasks is made challenging by occlusion due to the hand and the visual mismatch between the human hand and a robot end-effector. In this sense, the human hand presents a nuisance. However, often hands also provide a valuable signal, e.g. the hand pose may suggest what kind of object is being held. In this work, we propose to extract a factored representation of the scene that separates the agent (human hand) and the environment. This alleviates both occlusion and mismatch while preserving the signal, thereby easing the design of models for downstream robotics tasks. At the heart of this factorization is our proposed Video Inpainting via Diffusion Model (VIDM) that leverages both a prior on real-world images (through a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model) and the appearance of the object in earlier frames of the video (through attention). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VIDM at improving inpainting quality on egocentric videos and the power of our factored representation for numerous tasks: object detection, 3D reconstruction of manipulated objects, and learning of reward functions, policies, and affordances from videos.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Orthogonal Non-negative Tensor Factorization based Multi-view Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly Factorization Attention*\n\n*Jing Li, Quanxue Gao, Qianqian Wang, Ming Yang, Wei Xia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents orthogonal non-negative tensor factorization (Orth-NTF) and develops a novel multi-view clustering based on Orth-NTF with one-side orthogonal constraint and proves mathematically that the algorithm always converges to the stationary KKT point.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-view clustering (MVC) based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and its variants have attracted much attention due to their advantages in clustering interpretability. However, existing NMF-based multi-view clustering methods perform NMF on each view respectively and ignore the impact of between-view. Thus, they can\u2019t well exploit the within-view spatial structure and between-view complementary information. To resolve this issue, we present orthogonal non-negative tensor factorization (Orth-NTF) and develop a novel multi-view clustering based on Orth-NTF with one-side orthogonal constraint. Our model directly performs Orth-NTF on the 3rd-order tensor which is composed of anchor graphs of views. Thus, our model directly considers the between-view relationship. Moreover, we use the tensor Schatten p -norm regularization as a rank approximation of the 3rd-order tensor which characterizes the cluster structure of multi-view data and exploits the between-view complementary information. In addition, we provide an optimization algorithm for the proposed method and prove mathematically that the algorithm always converges to the stationary KKT point. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets indicate that our proposed method is able to achieve satisfactory clustering performance.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Inspired by the position embeddings in transformers, we aim to simplify and reduce the memory footprint of the multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism.

MHE attention only requires a negligible fraction of additional parameters ($3nd$, where $n$ is the number of attention heads and $d$ the size of the head embeddings) compared to a single-head attention, while MHA requires $(3n^2-3n)d^2-3nd$ additional parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Finding the Pillars of Strength for Multi-Head Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware Efficient Multi-Head Attention*\n\n*Jinjie Ni, Rui Mao, Zonglin Yang, Han Lei, E. Cambria*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, it is assumed that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed some issues of Multi-Head Attention (MHA), e.g., redundancy and over-parameterization. Specifically, the heads of MHA were originally designed to attend to information from different representation subspaces, whereas prior studies found that some attention heads likely learn similar features and can be pruned without harming performance. Inspired by the minimum-redundancy feature selection, we assume that focusing on the most representative and distinctive features with minimum resources can mitigate the above issues and lead to more effective and efficient MHAs. In particular, we propose Grouped Head Attention, trained with a self-supervised group constraint that group attention heads, where each group focuses on an essential but distinctive feature subset. We additionally propose a Voting-to-Stay procedure to remove redundant heads, thus achieving a transformer with lighter weights. Extensive experiments are consistent with our hypothesis. Moreover, our method achieves significant performance gains on three well-established tasks while considerably compressing parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Matrices in Transformers*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

How to reduce the parameter scale of LLMs has become research hotspots. In this study, we make an important observation that the multi-head self-attention (MHA) sub-layer of Transformer exhibits noticeable low-rank structure, while the feed-forward network (FFN) sub-layer does not. With this regard, we design a mixed compression model, which organically combines Low-Rank matrix approximation And structured Pruning (LoRAP). For the MHA sub-layer, we propose an input activation weighted singular value decomposition method to strengthen the low-rank characteristic. Furthermore, we discover that the weight matrices in MHA sub-layer have different low-rank degrees. Thus, a novel parameter allocation scheme according to the discrepancy of low-rank degrees is devised. For the FFN sub-layer, we propose a gradient-free structured channel pruning method. During the pruning, we get an interesting finding that the least important 1% of parameter actually play a vital role in model performance. Extensive evaluations on zero-shot perplexity and zero-shot task classification indicate that our proposal is superior to previous structured compression rivals under multiple compression ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

While the former can be computed efficiently, global interactions are usually modeled via attention mechanisms, which are expensive for long input sequences. Here, we address this by extending HyperMixer, an efficient alternative to attention exhibiting linear complexity, to the Conformer architecture for speech recognition, leading to HyperConformer. In particular, multi-head HyperConformer achieves comparable or higher recognition performance while being more efficient than Conformer in terms of inference speed, memory, parameter count, and available training data. HyperConformer achieves a word error rate of 2.9% on Librispeech test-clean with less than 8M neural parameters and a peak memory during training of 5.7GB, hence trainable with accessible hardware. Encoder speed is between 38% on mid-length speech and 56% on long speech faster than an equivalent Conformer.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware Efficient Multi-Head Attention*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly Factorization in Multi-Head Attention*\n\n*Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods and can be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training and lower extra storage cost than the existing works.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Neural Layers\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly Factorization in Multi-Head Attention*\n\n*M. Khodak, Neil A. Tenenholtz, Lester W. Mackey, Nicol\u00f3 Fusi*\n\n**TL;DR:** Factorized layers--operations parameterized by products of two or more matrices--occur in a variety of deep learning contexts, including compressed model training, certain types of knowledge distillation, and multi-head self-attention architectures, and deep nets containing such layers are studied.\n\n**Abstract:** Factorized layers--operations parameterized by products of two or more matrices--occur in a variety of deep learning contexts, including compressed model training, certain types of knowledge distillation, and multi-head self-attention architectures. We study how to initialize and regularize deep nets containing such layers, examining two simple, understudied schemes, spectral initialization and Frobenius decay, for improving their performance. The guiding insight is to design optimization routines for these networks that are as close as possible to that of their well-tuned, non-decomposed counterparts; we back this intuition with an analysis of how the initialization and regularization schemes impact training with gradient descent, drawing on modern attempts to understand the interplay of weight-decay and batch-normalization. Empirically, we highlight the benefits of spectral initialization and Frobenius decay across a variety of settings. In model compression, we show that they enable low-rank methods to significantly outperform both unstructured sparsity and tensor methods on the task of training low-memory residual networks; analogs of the schemes also improve the performance of tensor decomposition techniques. For knowledge distillation, Frobenius decay enables a simple, overcomplete baseline that yields a compact model from over-parameterized training without requiring retraining with or pruning a teacher network. Finally, we show how both schemes applied to multi-head attention lead to improved performance on both translation and unsupervised pre-training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Optimizations in Transformers*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. PackQViT: Faster Sub-8-bit Vision Transformers via Full and Packed Quantization on the Mobile\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Optimizations in Transformers*\n\n*Peiyan Dong, Lei Lu, Chao Wu, Cheng Lyu, Geng Yuan, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making and develops a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT Acceleration on mobile phones.\n\n**Abstract:** While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have undoubtedly made impressive strides in computer vision (CV), their intricate network structures necessitate substantial computation and memory resources. A decision-making process for CV tasks typically entails performing computations with low latency, which is a tricky problem for ViT models. Model quantization is a widely-used technique to optimize the hardware ef\ufb01ciency of deep neural networks. Full quantization under Sub-8-bit precision, in particular, is a promising solution to reduce inference latency significantly. Unfortunately, current commodity hardware, such as CPUs and GPUs, still struggles to ef\ufb01ciently execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks, as their SIMD instructions only support a granularity of 8 bits or wider. Also, there is a scarcity of literature that presents a full quantization paradigm for ViTs. In this paper, we propose an activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making. Speci\ufb01cally, in revisiting data activation within the ViT data\ufb02ow, two characteristics are relevant to quantization strategy and precision: the long-tailed distribution and systematic channel-wise outliers. In response, we employ either log2 quantization or clipping to address the long-tailed distribution and incorporate outlier-aware training for residual link quantization to regulate the various channel-wise outliers more consistently. Notably, due to the systematic \ufb01xed pattern, outlier-aware training approach can predict the channel indices and regularized scales of outliers in advance, thus avoiding the runtime data-adaptive selection during inference. Furthermore, we employ Int-2 n -Softmax, Int-LayerNorm, and Integer GELU to enable integer-only computation \ufb02ow. Finally, we develop a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT acceleration on mobile phones. Compared to prior studies on ViT quantization using 8-bit precision, PackQViT surpasses other works by an improved accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 17.9% for various widely used ViTs on ImageNet dataset; under 4-bit precision, PackQViT demonstrates 0.4% \u21e0 2.8% higher accuracy. Compared to the baseline multiplier, our implementations on the Realme GT Android smartphone with Snapdragon 870 SoC CPU achieve 2 . 6 \u21e5\u21e0 3 . 7 \u21e5 speedup under 8-bit scenario and 3 . 8 \u21e5\u21e0 5 . 9 \u21e5 speedup under 4-bit which ensures practical real-time performance.

DevFormer: A Symmetric Transformer for Context-Aware Device Placement\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Optimizations in Transformers*\n\n*Haeyeon Kim, Minsu Kim, Federico Berto, Joungho Kim, Jinkyoo Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper applies DevFoemer to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while reducing the number of components by more than $30\\%$.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present DevFormer, a novel transformer-based architecture for addressing the complex and computationally demanding problem of hardware design optimization. Despite the demonstrated efficacy of transformers in domains including natural language processing and computer vision, their use in hardware design has been limited by the scarcity of offline data. Our approach addresses this limitation by introducing strong inductive biases such as relative positional embeddings and action-permutation symmetricity that effectively capture the hardware context and enable efficient design optimization with limited offline data. We apply DevFoemer to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while reducing the number of components by more than $30\\%$. Finally, we show that our approach achieves promising results in other offline contextual learning-based combinatorial optimization tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Optimizations in Transformers*\n\n*Song Han, Xingyu Dang, Guangxuan Xiao, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Chuang Gan, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Jiaming Tang, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Q8BERT: Quantized 8Bit BERT\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Optimizations in Transformers*\n\n*Peter Izsak, Ofir Zafrir, Moshe Wasserblat, Guy Boudoukh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, pre-trained Transformer based language models such as BERT and GPT, have shown great improvement in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, these models contain a large amount of parameters. The emergence of even larger and more accurate models such as GPT2 and Megatron, suggest a trend of large pre-trained Transformer models. However, using these large models in production environments is a complex task requiring a large amount of compute, memory and power resources. In this work we show how to perform quantization-aware training during the fine-tuning phase of BERT in order to compress BERT by $4\\times$ with minimal accuracy loss. Furthermore, the produced quantized model can accelerate inference speed if it is optimized for 8bit Integer supporting hardware.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding for Template-based Music Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Quantization Techniques for Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*L\u00e9opold Crestel, Ga\u00ebtan Hadjeres*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose a flexible method for generating variations of discrete sequences in which tokens can be grouped into basic units, like sentences in a text or bars in music. More precisely, given a template sequence, we aim at producing novel sequences sharing perceptible similarities with the original template without relying on any annotation; so our problem of generating variations is intimately linked to the problem of learning relevant high-level representations without supervision. Our contribution is two-fold: First, we propose a self-supervised encoding technique, named Vector Quantized Contrastive Predictive Coding which allows to learn a meaningful assignment of the basic units over a discrete set of codes, together with mechanisms allowing to control the information content of these learnt discrete representations. Secondly, we show how these compressed representations can be used to generate variations of a template sequence by using an appropriate attention pattern in the Transformer architecture. We illustrate our approach on the corpus of J.S. Bach chorales where we discuss the musical meaning of the learnt discrete codes and show that our proposed method allows to generate coherent and high-quality variations of a given template.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Context-aware Communication for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Quantization Techniques for Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Jun Zhang, Xinran Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Effective communication protocols in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) are critical to fostering cooperation and enhancing team performance. To leverage communication, many previous works have proposed to compress local information into a single message and broadcast it to all reachable agents. This simplistic messaging mechanism, however, may fail to provide adequate, critical, and relevant information to individual agents, especially in severely bandwidth-limited scenarios. This motivates us to develop context-aware communication schemes for MARL, aiming to deliver personalized messages to different agents. Our communication protocol, named CACOM, consists of two stages. In the first stage, agents exchange coarse representations in a broadcast fashion, providing context for the second stage. Following this, agents utilize attention mechanisms in the second stage to selectively generate messages personalized for the receivers. Furthermore, we employ the learned step size quantization (LSQ) technique for message quantization to reduce the communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness of CACOM, we integrate it with both actor-critic and value-based MARL algorithms. Empirical results on cooperative benchmark tasks demonstrate that CACOM provides evident performance gains over baselines under communication-constrained scenarios.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*R. Child, S. Gray, Alec Radford, I. Sutskever*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2019)\t**Cited by** 1488  (*Influential: 137*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n)$, and generates unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and shows it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are powerful sequence models, but require time and memory that grows quadratically with the sequence length. In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nWe tested whether such factorizations could match in performance the rich connectivity patterns of Figure 2. ### 4.1. Qualitative assessment of learned attention patterns\n\nWe visualized the attention patterns learned by a 128-layer self-attention network on CIFAR-10, and present several examples in Figure 2. Visual inspection showed that most layers had sparse attention patterns across most data points, suggesting that some form of sparsity could be introduced without significantly affecting performance. Several layers (Figure 2c) clearly exhibited global patterns, however, and others exhibited data-dependent sparsity (Figure 2d), both of which would be impacted by introducing a predetermined sparsity pattern into all of the attention matrices. In this paper, we restricted our investigation to a class of sparse attention patterns that have connectivity between all positions over several steps of attention. These methods can be more efficient than full attention while still providing global context to any given position. We aimed to empirically validate the performance of these factorized patterns on a range of tasks, given that they are unable to learn the exact same mappings as those in Figure 2. We present the formulation of factorized attention below. ### 4.2. Factorized self-attention\n\nA self-attention layer maps a matrix of input embeddings $X$ to an output matrix and is parameterized by a connectivity pattern $S=\\left\\{S_{1}, \\ldots, S_{n}\\right\\}$, where $S_{i}$ denotes the set of indices of the input vectors to which the $i$ th output vector attends. The output vector is a weighted sum of transformations of the input vectors:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Attend}(X, S)=\\left(a\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, S_{i}\\right)\\right)_{i \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}} \\\\\na\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{i}, S_{i}\\right)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\left(W_{q} \\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right) K_{S_{i}}^{T}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V_{S_{i}} \\\\\nK_{S_{i}}=\\left(W_{k} \\mathbf{x}_{j}\\right)_{j \\in S_{i}} \\quad V_{S_{i}}=\\left(W_{v} \\mathbf{x}_{j}\\right)_{j \\in S_{i}}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nHere $W_{q}, W_{k}$, and $W_{v}$ represent the weight matrices which transform a given $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$ into a query, key, or value, and $d$ is the inner dimension of the queries and keys. The output at each position is a sum of the values weighted by the scaled dot-product similarity of the keys and queries. Full self-attention for autoregressive models defines $S_{i}=$ $\\{j: j \\leq i\\}$, allowing every element to attend to all previous positions and its own position. Factorized self-attention instead has $p$ separate attention heads, where the $m$ th head defines a subset of the indices $A_{i}^{(m)} \\subset\\{j: j \\leq i\\}$ and lets $S_{i}=A_{i}^{(m)}$. We are chiefly interested in efficient choices for the subset $A$, where $\\left|A_{i}^{(m)}\\right| \\propto \\sqrt[p]{n}$. Additionally, for the time being we consider valid choices of $A$, where all input positions are connected to all future output positions across the $p$ steps of attention. For every $j \\leq i$ pair, we set every $A$ such that $i$ can attend to $j$ through a path of locations with maximum length $p+1$. Specifically, if $(j, a, b, c, \\ldots, i)$ is the path of indices, then $j \\in A_{a}^{(1)}, a \\in A_{b}^{(2)}, b \\in A_{c}^{(3)}$, and so forth. These two criteria allow us keep the ability of Transformers to propagate signals from arbitrary input positions to arbitrary output positions in a constant number of steps, while reducing the total effective computation to $O(n \\sqrt[p]{n})$. We also note that softening the validity criterion (for instance, having a series of only locally connected layers) may be a useful inductive bias for certain domains. In this work, we explore two factorizations for $p=2$, which we describe in the following section, though we note that the same techniques can be easily extended to higher dimensions. ### 4.3. Two-dimensional factorized attention\n\nA natural approach to defining a factorized attention pattern in two dimensions is to have one head attend to the previous $l$ locations, and the other head attend to every $l$ th location, where $l$ is the stride and chosen to be close to $\\sqrt{n}$, a method we call strided attention.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Score: 0.90)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

ToolAlpaca: Generalized Tool Learning for Language Models with 3000 Simulated Cases\n\n*Boxi Cao, Le Sun, Qiao Liang, Xianpei Han, Hongyu Lin, Ziliang Deng, Qiaoyu Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Enabling large language models to utilize real-world tools effectively is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Existing approaches to tool learning have either primarily relied on extremely large language models, such as GPT-4, to attain generalized tool-use abilities in a zero-shot manner, or utilized supervised learning to train limited scopes of tools on compact models. However, it remains uncertain whether smaller language models can achieve generalized tool-use abilities without tool-specific training. To address this question, this paper introduces ToolAlpaca, a novel framework designed to automatically generate a diverse tool-use corpus and learn generalized tool-use abilities on compact language models with minimal human intervention. Specifically, ToolAlpaca first automatically creates a highly diversified tool-use corpus by building a multi-agent simulation environment. The corpus contains 3938 tool-use instances from more than 400 real-world tool APIs spanning 50 distinct categories. Subsequently, the constructed corpus is employed to fine-tune compact language models, resulting in two models, namely ToolAlpaca-7B and ToolAlpaca-13B, respectively. Finally, we evaluate the ability of these models to utilize previously unseen tools without specific training. Experimental results demonstrate that ToolAlpaca achieves effective generalized tool-use capabilities comparable to those of extremely large language models like GPT-3.5, demonstrating that learning generalized tool-use ability is feasible for compact language models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hallo2: Long-Duration and High-Resolution Audio-Driven Portrait Image Animation\n\n*Jingdong Wang, Siyu Zhu, Hang Zhou, Kaihui Cheng, Hanlin Shang, Hao Zhu, Yao Yao, Hui Li, Jiahao Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in latent diffusion-based generative models for portrait image animation, such as Hallo, have achieved impressive results in short-duration video synthesis. In this paper, we present updates to Hallo, introducing several design enhancements to extend its capabilities. First, we extend the method to produce long-duration videos. To address substantial challenges such as appearance drift and temporal artifacts, we investigate augmentation strategies within the image space of conditional motion frames. Specifically, we introduce a patch-drop technique augmented with Gaussian noise to enhance visual consistency and temporal coherence over long duration. Second, we achieve 4K resolution portrait video generation. To accomplish this, we implement vector quantization of latent codes and apply temporal alignment techniques to maintain coherence across the temporal dimension. By integrating a high-quality decoder, we realize visual synthesis at 4K resolution. Third, we incorporate adjustable semantic textual labels for portrait expressions as conditional inputs. This extends beyond traditional audio cues to improve controllability and increase the diversity of the generated content. To the best of our knowledge, Hallo2, proposed in this paper, is the first method to achieve 4K resolution and generate hour-long, audio-driven portrait image animations enhanced with textual prompts. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on publicly available datasets, including HDTF, CelebV, and our introduced \"Wild\" dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-duration portrait video animation, successfully generating rich and controllable content at 4K resolution for duration extending up to tens of minutes.

PTQ4SAM: Post-Training Quantization for Segment Anything\n\n*From Search Query: Quantization of Attention Mechanisms AND Hardware Acceleration*\n\n*Xianglong Liu, Yifu Ding, Jinyang Guo, Hong Chen, Chengtao Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved impressive performance in many computer vision tasks. However, as a large-scale model, the immense memory and computation costs hinder its practical deployment. In this paper, we propose a post-training quantization (PTQ) framework for Segment Anything Model, namely PTQ4SAM. First, we investigate the inherent bottleneck of SAM quantization attributed to the bimodal distribution in post-Key-Linear activations. We analyze its characteristics from both per-tensor and per-channel perspectives, and propose a Bimodal Integration strategy, which utilizes a mathematically equivalent sign operation to transform the bimodal distribution into a relatively easy-quantized normal distribution offline. Second, SAM encompasses diverse attention mechanisms (i.e., self-attention and two-way cross-attention), resulting in substantial variations in the post-Softmax distributions. Therefore, we introduce an Adaptive Granularity Quantization for Softmax through searching the optimal power-of-two base, which is hardware-friendly. Extensive experimental results across various vision tasks (instance segmentation, semantic segmentation and object detection), datasets and model variants show the superiority of PTQ4SAM. For example, when quantizing SAM-L to 6-bit, we achieve lossless accuracy for instance segmentation, about 0.5\\% drop with theoretical 3.9$\\times$ acceleration. The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/PTQ4SAM}.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-06\n\n\n\n#### 4. Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Quantization of Attention Mechanisms AND Hardware Acceleration*\n\n*Lior Wolf, Yoni Choukroun, Matan Levy*\n\n**Abstract:** Error correction codes (ECC) are crucial for ensuring reliable information transmission in communication systems. Choukroun & Wolf (2022b) recently introduced the Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT), which has demonstrated promising performance across various transmission channels and families of codes. However, its high computational and memory demands limit its practical applications compared to traditional decoding algorithms. Achieving effective quantization of the ECCT presents significant challenges due to its inherently small architecture, since existing, very low-precision quantization techniques often lead to performance degradation in compact neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel acceleration method for transformer-based decoders. We first propose a ternary weight quantization method specifically designed for the ECCT, inducing a decoder with multiplication-free linear layers. We present an optimized self-attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity via codeaware multi-heads processing. Finally, we provide positional encoding via the Tanner graph eigendecomposition, enabling a richer representation of the graph connectivity. The approach not only matches or surpasses ECCT's performance but also significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and computational complexity. Our method brings transformer-based error correction closer to practical implementation in resource-constrained environments, achieving a 90% compression ratio and reducing arithmetic operation energy consumption by at least 224 times on modern hardware.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, particularly by applying butterfly factorization to Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and incorporating hardware-aware optimizations, here are the key points and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Novelty and Application of Butterfly Factorization\n\n- The proposal to apply butterfly factorization directly to MHA for hardware efficiency appears novel, as existing works have primarily used butterfly factorization in other contexts such as fast algorithms for linear transforms.\n- There is a need to confirm this novelty through a thorough literature review focusing on recent publications (2023 onwards) to ensure no similar work has been done.\n\n## Initialization and Regularization of Factorized Layers\n\n- The work by *Khodak et al.

While various approaches have attempted to address these issues through algorithmic innovations, the hardware aspects of efficiency are often overlooked. There is a critical need for attention mechanisms that are explicitly designed to leverage modern hardware capabilities while maintaining model quality.\n\n## Problem Analysis\nCurrent MHA implementations face several key challenges:\n1. Memory bandwidth bottlenecks due to inefficient data movement patterns\n2. Sub-optimal utilization of specialized matrix multiplication units\n3. High memory requirements for storing attention weights and intermediate results\n4. Inefficient computation patterns that don't match hardware capabilities\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\nThe core idea is to redesign the MHA mechanism with hardware efficiency as a primary consideration, incorporating:\n1. Structured matrix computations using butterfly factorization\n2. Hardware-aware memory access patterns\n3. Efficient quantization strategies\n4. IO-aware algorithm design\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Modified MHA Architecture\nThe HardwareEfficientMHA modifies the standard MHA structure with the following components:\n\n1.
