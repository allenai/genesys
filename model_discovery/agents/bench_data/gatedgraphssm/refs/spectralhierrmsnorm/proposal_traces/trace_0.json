Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Score: 0.22)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Integration of Spectral Filtering in Normalization:**\n  - **Purpose:** Embedding spectral filtering within normalization layers can allow the model to selectively emphasize or suppress certain frequency components of the input features. This enhances the model's ability to capture both high-frequency details and low-frequency contextual information, leading to more robust and discriminative feature representations.\n  - **Implementation Consideration:** Incorporating learnable spectral filters that operate alongside RMS normalization can provide the model with the flexibility to adaptively adjust feature representations based on the input data's spectral characteristics. This can be achieved by introducing spectral filtering parameters that are optimized during training to enhance relevant features.\n\n- **Adaptive Multi-Scale Normalization:**\n  - **Purpose:** Adaptive normalization adjusts normalization parameters in response to changing input statistics, which is particularly beneficial in handling diverse and complex data distributions. When combined with multi-scale approaches, it allows the model to maintain optimal feature distributions across different spatial or temporal scales, improving overall model performance and stability.\n  - **Implementation Consideration:** Introducing mechanisms that allow normalization parameters to be dynamically influenced by multi-scale feature aggregations can lead to more consistent and stable training, especially in deep hierarchical architectures. This can involve designing adaptive controllers or modulators that adjust normalization parameters based on aggregated multi-scale statistics.\n\n- **Advanced Hierarchical Normalization Techniques:**\n  - **Purpose:** Exploring multi-scale normalization strategies enables the model to capture both local and global contextual information effectively. This is crucial for autoregressive language models that need to understand complex dependencies across different parts of the input sequence.\n  - **Implementation Consideration:** Implementing hierarchical normalization at multiple levels of the network can ensure that feature distributions are consistently maintained, facilitating deeper network architectures without the risk of vanishing or exploding gradients. This can involve stacking multiple normalization layers with different scopes or integrating normalization parameters that vary across different hierarchical levels.\n\n- **Enhancing Stability and Efficiency:**\n  - **Purpose:** The current design aims to balance stability and adaptivity without incurring significant computational overhead. By leveraging spectral filtering and selective integration at multiple scales, it's possible to achieve enhanced feature representation while maintaining computational and memory efficiency.\n  - **Implementation Consideration:** Ensuring that the added spectral and multi-scale operations do not introduce prohibitive computational costs is crucial. Techniques such as parameter sharing, efficient convolution operations, and leveraging hardware accelerations can mitigate potential efficiency drawbacks. Additionally, careful architectural design can ensure that these enhancements are modular and do not disrupt the existing GAU functionalities.\n\n- **Compatibility with Existing GAUs:**\n  - **Purpose:** Any enhancements to **HierarchicalRMSNorm** should seamlessly integrate with existing GAUs like **RotaryPositionalEmbeddings** and **ScaleIntegration**.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN. We investigate key components of our proposed PRepBN, i.e., the progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN). Directly train-\nTable 7.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Here are the key insights and relevant information that can guide this research:\n\n### Hierarchical Normalization\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization Layers**: The concept of hierarchical normalization, as discussed in the context of transformers, is crucial. This involves normalizing feature distributions at multiple levels of the network hierarchy, ensuring stability and preventing issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n### Spectral Normalization\n\n- **Spectral Normalization for Stability**: Spectral normalization controls the Lipschitz constant of the network by normalizing weight matrices by their spectral norm. This technique stabilizes the training process and prevents mode collapse, ensuring robust feature representation.\n\n### Spectral Filtering\n\n- **Feature Enhancement through Spectral Filtering**: Incorporating spectral filtering within normalization layers allows the model to emphasize specific frequency components of the input features while suppressing noise. This can improve the model's ability to capture essential patterns and enhance feature representation.\n\n### Adaptive Multi-Scale Normalization\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Adaptive normalization mechanisms adjust normalization parameters based on input statistics, enabling the model to handle diverse data distributions and input complexities. This adaptability is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n- **Multi-Scale Feature Capture**: Integrating multi-scale normalization allows the model to capture both local and global dependencies within the input sequences. This hierarchical approach ensures that feature maps maintain consistency and enhance discriminative capabilities across different scales.\n\n### Computational Efficiency\n\n- **Optimization Techniques**: To maintain computational efficiency, techniques such as parameter sharing, efficient convolution operations, and leveraging hardware accelerations can be employed. This ensures that the additional computational overhead introduced by spectral and multi-scale normalization is minimized.\n\n### Compatibility and Scalability\n\n- **Modular Enhancements**: Ensuring that changes to the normalization layer are modular and encapsulated allows for seamless integration with other components of the LM block, such as attention mechanisms and positional embeddings. This maintains the coherence of the overall design and prevents unintended interference.\n\n- **Scalable Design**: A well-designed hierarchical normalization layer that incorporates spectral and adaptive multi-scale strategies enhances the scalability of the LM block, allowing it to handle larger models and more extensive datasets without degradation in performance or efficiency.\n\n### Future Search and Implementation Plan\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Spectral Filtering Mechanisms**:\n   - Investigate various spectral filtering techniques and their impact on feature representation and model stability. Understand how different spectral filters can be applied within normalization layers to enhance the model's performance.\n\n2. **Investigate Adaptive Normalization Controllers**:\n   - Research mechanisms for dynamically adjusting normalization parameters based on multi-scale feature statistics. Explore existing implementations and their performance in language model contexts to identify the most effective strategies.\n\n3. **Assess Computational Efficiency Strategies**:\n   - Look into optimization techniques such as low-rank approximations or efficient convolutional implementations to integrate spectral and multi-scale operations without significant computational overhead.\n\n4. **Identify Benchmark Studies**:\n   - Find studies that benchmark the performance of different normalization techniques in language models, focusing on metrics related to feature representation, training stability, and computational efficiency. This will help in evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements.\n\n5. **Plan for Empirical Validation**:\n   - Design experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed normalization enhancements.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Integration of Spectral Filtering in Hierarchical Normalization:**\n  - **Enhancement of Feature Representation:** Embedding spectral filtering within the normalization layers allows the model to selectively emphasize relevant frequency components of the input features while suppressing noise. This selective focus can lead to more discriminative and robust feature representations.\n  - **Stabilization of Training:** Spectral normalization, by controlling the spectral norm of weight matrices, helps in stabilizing the training process, preventing issues like mode collapse and ensuring consistent feature scaling across different network layers.\n\n- **Adaptive Multi-Scale Normalization:**\n  - **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:** Adaptive normalization mechanisms adjust normalization parameters based on input statistics, enabling the model to handle a wide range of data distributions and input complexities. This adaptability is crucial for autoregressive language models that process diverse and contextually rich data.\n  - **Capture of Local and Global Contexts:** By integrating multi-scale normalization, the model can effectively capture both local (short-range) and global (long-range) dependencies within the input sequences. This hierarchical approach ensures that feature maps maintain consistency and enhance discriminative capabilities across different scales.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency and Model Stability:**\n  - **Optimizing Computational Load:** Techniques such as parameter sharing and efficient convolution operations can mitigate the additional computational overhead introduced by spectral and multi-scale normalization. Leveraging hardware accelerations and optimized implementations ensures that efficiency gains are realized without compromising performance.\n  - **Maintaining Training Stability:** Hierarchical normalization, especially when augmented with spectral filtering and adaptive mechanisms, contributes to overall model stability. The controlled scaling of features and dynamic parameter adjustments prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, facilitating the training of deeper and more complex architectures.\n\n- **Compatibility with Existing GAUs:**\n  - **Modular Enhancements:** Ensuring that changes to **HierarchicalRMSNorm** are modular and encapsulated allows for seamless integration with sibling GAUs such as **RotaryPositionalEmbeddings** and **ScaleIntegration**.

MEGALODON: Efficient LLM Pretraining and Inference with Unlimited Context Length (Avg. Score: 0.48)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiaomeng Yang, Wenhan Xiong, Beidi Chen, Lili Yu, Hao Zhang, Jonathan May, Luke Zettlemoyer, Omer Levy, Chunting Zhou*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity and weak length extrapolation of Transformers limits their ability to scale to long sequences, and while sub-quadratic solutions like linear attention and state space models exist, they empirically underperform Transformers in pretraining efficiency and downstream task accuracy. We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).

For classification task, we replace the timestep normalization with the standard group normalization method. Top-1 accuracy on the validation set is reported in Table 4 to assess various models. MEGALODON obtains about $1.3 \\%$ accuracy improvement over DeiT-B (Touvron et al., 2021), and 0.8\\%. improvement over MEGA (Ma et al., 2023). Auto-regressive Language Modeling on PG-19 We also evaluate MEgALODON on auto-regressive language modeling on the medium-scale PG19 (Rae et al., 2019) datasets. We use the same vocabulary from Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and adopt most of its hyper-parameters to train a MEgAlodon model with 1.3B parameters. Table 5 illustrate the word-level perplexity (PPL) of MEGALODON on PG-19, together with previous state-of-the-art models, including Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020), Perceiver AR (Hawthorne et al., 2022), Block-Recurrent Transformer (Hutchins et al., 2022) and MEGAB yte (Yu et al., 2024). MEgAlODON significantly outperforms all the baselines. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced MEgALODON, an improved MEGA architecture with multiple novel technical components, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), the timestep normalization layer, normalized attention and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration, to improve its capability, efficiency and scalability. Through a direct comparison with Llama2, MEGAlODON achieves impressive improvements on both training perplexity and across downstream benchmarks. Importantly, experimental results on long-context modeling demonstrate MEGALODON's ability to model sequences of unlimited length. Additional experiments on small/medium-scale benchmarks across different data modalities illustrate the robust improvements of MEGALODON, which lead to a potential direction of future work to apply MEGALODON for large-scale multi-modality pretraining. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Sadhika Malladi, Zihao Ye, Dacheng Li and Rulin Shao for their helpful feedback and discussion during this work. ## References\n\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.07)\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4. Ablation Studies\n\nIn this section, we conduct extensive ablation studies to demonstrate the impact of our key designs. The impact of SLA and PRepBN. We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory. ## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a core problem in sequence prediction/modelling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Hop82, RHW ${ }^{+}$85, Elm90] are a natural choice, but are notoriously hard to train; they often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients [BSF94, PMB13] and despite techniques to mitigate the issue [HS97, $\\mathrm{CVMG}^{+}$14, ASB16], they are also hard to scale given the inherently sequential nature of their computation. In recent years, transformer models $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17 have become the staple of sequence modelling, achieving remarkable success across multiple domains $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+}\\right.$20, $\\mathrm{DBK}^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{JEP}^{+}$21]. Transformer models are naturally parallelizable and hence scale significantly better than RNNs. However, attention layers have memory/computation requirements that scale quadratically with context length. Many approximations have been proposed (see [TDBM22] for a recent survey). RNNs have seen a recent resurgence in the form of state space models (SSM) which have shown promise in modelling long sequences across varied modalities GGR21, $\\mathrm{DFS}^{+}$22, GGB22, $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23$, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23, GD23]. SSMs use linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the sequence-to sequence transform by evolving the internal state of a dynamical system according to the dynamics equations\n\n$$\nx_{t}=A x_{t-1}+B u_{t} \\quad y_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the hidden state of the dynamical system, $u_{t}$ is the input to the system, and $y_{t}$ are observations. The matrices $A, B, C, D$ govern the evolution of the system and are called system matrices. Despite its simplicity, this linear model can capture a rich set of natural dynamical systems\nin engineering and the physical sciences due to the potentially large number of hidden dimensions. Linear dynamical systems are also attractive as a sequence model because their structure is amenable to both fast inference and fast training via parallel scans [Ble89, SWL23] or convolutions [GGR21]. A rich literature stemming from control theory and recent machine learning interest has given rise to efficient techniques for system identification, filtering, and prediction for linear dynamical systems. For a survey of recent literature see [HS22]. These techniques make SSMs attractive for sequence tasks which inherently depend on long contexts that scale poorly for transformers. Examples include large language models [DFS ${ }^{+}$22], modelling time series [ZSP ${ }^{+}$23], and audio generation [GGDR22]. To understand the factors affecting the memory in an SSM or simply a linear dynamical system, we now proceed to delineate how past states and inputs affect the future. Geometric decay in LDS. The linear equations governing the dynamics are recursive in nature, and imply that in a noiseless environment, the $t$ 'th output can be written as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}=C\\left(A x_{t-1}+B u_{t}\\right)+D u_{t}=\\ldots=\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nThe matrix $A$ is asymmetric in general, and can have complex eigenvalues. If the amplitude of these eigenvalues is $>1$, then the output $y_{t}$ can grow without bounds. This is called an \"explosive\" system. In a well-behaved system, the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitude $<1$. If the magnitudes are bounded away from 1 , say $\\left|\\lambda_{i}(A)\\right|<1-\\delta$, for some $\\delta>0$ (referred to as spectral gap), then we can write\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+\\omega_{k},\\left\\|\\omega_{k}\\right\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor $k=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This mathematical fact implies that the effective memory of the system is on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$. In general, the parameter $\\delta$ is unknown apriori and can get arbitrarily small as we approach systems with have long range dependencies leading to instability in training linear dynamical systems with a long context. This issue is specifically highlighted in the work of [ $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+}$23] who observe that on long range tasks learning an LDS directly does not succeed and requires interventions such as stable exponential parameterizations and specific normalization which have been repeatedly used either implicitly or explicitly in the SSM literature [GGR21]. Unfortunately these reparametrizations and normalizations come with no theoretical guarantees. In fact this limitation is generally known to be fundamental to the use of linear dynamical systems, and can only be circumvented via a significant increase in sample complexity $\\left[\\mathrm{GLS}^{+}\\right.$20] or via control over the input sequence [SMT ${ }^{+}$18]. Spectral filtering for linear dynamical systems. A notable deviation from the standard theory of linear dynamical systems that allows efficient learning in the presence of arbitrarily long memory is the technique of spectral filtering [HSZ17]. The idea is to project the sequence of inputs to a small subspace that is constructed using special structure of discrete LDS where successive powers of the system matrix appear in the impulse response function. The basic idea is to represent the output as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} M_{j}\\left(\\sum_{i} \\phi_{j}(i) \\cdot u_{t-i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{j}$ are spectral filters which are sequence-length sized vectors that given the target sequence length can be computed offline, and $M_{j}$ are matrices parameterizing the model. These spectral-filters are the eigenvectors of the matrix constructed as the average of outer products of the discrete impulseresponse functions, viz $Z=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]^{\\top} d \\alpha$. It is shown that this matrix is inherently low-dimensional and for all $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, vectors of the form $\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]$ are well approximated by the top-eigenspace of Z. Figure 1 depicts these filters. For the details of how these filters are derived and their computation, see Section 2\n\nWhy is spectral filtering important? The main advantage of spectral filtering is that for certain types of linear dynamical systems, in particular those with symmetric matrices $A$, the effective memory(measured by the number of filters) required to represent an observation at any point in the sequence in the spectral basis is independent of the spectral gap parameter $\\delta!$. This guarantee indicates that if we featurize the input into the spectral basis, we can potentially design models that\nare capable of efficiently and stably representing systems with extremely long memory even with $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. This striking fact motivates our derivation of the recurrent spectral architecture, and is the underlying justification for the performance and training stability gains we see in experiments. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_28085b3c06af8ebfb6a7g-03.jpg?height=524&width=816&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=641)\n\nFigure 1: Spectral Filters used by the Spectral Filtering Algorithm. The x-axis is the time domain. ### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nWe start by proposing state space models with learned components that apply spectral filtering for their featurization. We consider two types of spectral filters, which augment the original spectral filters proposed in HSZ17] with negative eigenvalues in two different ways. Our main contribution is a neural architecture that is based on these spectral state space models. This neural architecture can be applied recursively in layers, resulting in an expressive architecture for modeling sequential data. Finally we implement this neural architecture and apply it towards synthetically generated data as well as the Long Range Arena benchmark [TDA ${ }^{+21]}$. We demonstrate that spectral state space models can stably and more efficiently learn on sequence modelling tasks with long range dependencies without the need for exponential parameterizations, particular initializations and normalizations. Main Advantages of Spectral SSM. Previously proposed convolutional models for sequence modeling, surveyed in the related work section, learn the kernels from the data. The kernels used in Spectral SSM are theoretically-founded and fixed and thus parameter-free. In addition, our models are provably as expressive as an LDS. In particular, their expressiveness neither depends on the spectra gap nor on the dimension of the system, which are necessary in all other methods. ### 1.2 Related work\n\nDue to limited space, we provide a short overview of the most related work to us below and provide a detailed report on the related work in the appendix (Section A). State space models. SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years starting with the works [GDE $\\left.{ }^{+} 20\\right],\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ which propose and develop the HiPPO theory. [GGR21] develop the S4 parameterization to address the bottlenecks of training efficiency, performance and numberical stability. The $S 4$ parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization. The S 4 model was further streamlined in later works, viz. using diagonal system matrices without a loss in performance [GGB22] and the S5 model [SWL23] which uses a MIMO diagonal system and associative scans for computational efficiency. [OSG $\\left.{ }^{+} 23\\right]$ investigate whether simpler deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer under the crucial caveat that specific modifications on linear RNNs, namely the stable exponential parameterization, $\\gamma$ - normalization and ring initialization, are necessary to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/31 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nIn our experiments we search over two values of $k_{y}=\\{2,32\\}$. For non-image tasks, ListOps, Text and Retrieval, we find that setting $k_{y}=2$ is sufficient to get optimal results. For the image tasks, CIFAR, Pathfinder and PathX, we found that $k_{y}=32$ led to significant performance gains. A performance ablation over this parameter can be found in the appendix (Table 2]. Overall we find that the STU model provides improvements over baselines such as S4 and LRU on 4 out of the 6 tasks and performs comparably to the best baseline on the others. Remarkably, the STU layers come with provable guarantees and thus performs well out of the box without the need for specific initializations, discretizations or normalizations. We initialize all parameters $M_{i}^{y}, M_{i}^{u}, M_{k}^{\\phi+}, M_{k}^{\\phi-}$ with 0 . We provide details of the experimental setup, including hyperparameter tuning in the appendix (Section E). ## 6 Conclusion\n\nInsprired by the success of SSMs, we present a new theoretically-founded deep neural network architecture, Spectral SSM, for sequence modelling based on the Spectral Filtering algorithm for\nlearning Linear Dynamical Systems. The SSM performs a reparameterization of the LDS and is guaranteed to learn even marginally stable symmetric LDS stably and efficiently. We demonstrate the core advantages of the Spectal SSM, viz. robustness to long memory through experiments on a synthetic LDS and the Long Range Arena benchmark. We find that the Spectral SSM is able to learn even in the presence of large context lengths/memory without the need for designing specific initializations, discretizations or normalizations which were necessary for existing SSMs to learn in such settings. While spectral SSMs only model symmetric A, our presented set of experiments on the LRA benchmark suggest that the gap between symmetric and general A is potentially small in real world tasks. Indeed more recent SSM models like [GD23, $\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}$24] work with real diagonals (i.e. symmetric case) as they do not find evidence that adding complex eigenvalues help. Spectral filtering has been extended in certain settings to asymmetric A [HLS ${ }^{+}$18] and a similar extension to our proposal is straightforward but comes with efficiency losses and we leave it to future work. ## References\n\n[ASB16] Martin Arjovsky, Amar Shah, and Yoshua Bengio.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization language models state space*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 2.

Lim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Distribution Normalization (DN) is proposed, where the mean representation of a batch of test samples is approximate and used to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss, which requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Advances in the field of vision-language contrastive learning have made it possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently known as CLIP has garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This paper reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should also be in alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative samples information during inference in a computationally efficient way. To this end, we propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear advantage of DN over the dot product on top of other existing test-time augmentation methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization language models state space*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Recurrent Neural Language Models as Probabilistic Finite-state Automata\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization language models state space*\n\n*Anej Svete, Ryan Cotterell*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that simple RNNs are equivalent to a subclass of probabilistic finite-state automata, and can thus model a strict subset of probability distributions expressible by finite-state models, and study the space complexity of representing finite-state LMs with RNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Studying language models (LMs) in terms of well-understood formalisms allows us to precisely characterize their abilities and limitations. Previous work has investigated the representational capacity of recurrent neural network (RNN) LMs in terms of their capacity to recognize unweighted formal languages. However, LMs do not describe unweighted formal languages -- rather, they define \\emph{probability distributions} over strings. In this work, we study what classes of such probability distributions RNN LMs can represent, which allows us to make more direct statements about their capabilities. We show that simple RNNs are equivalent to a subclass of probabilistic finite-state automata, and can thus model a strict subset of probability distributions expressible by finite-state models. Furthermore, we study the space complexity of representing finite-state LMs with RNNs. We show that, to represent an arbitrary deterministic finite-state LM with $N$ states over an alphabet $\\alphabet$, an RNN requires $\\Omega\\left(N |\\Sigma|\\right)$ neurons. These results present a first step towards characterizing the classes of distributions RNN LMs can represent and thus help us understand their capabilities and limitations.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Continuous-time identification of dynamic state-space models by deep subspace encoding\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization language models state space*\n\n*G. Beintema, M. Schoukens, R. T'oth*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and it is shown that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Abstract:** Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using the keywords \"spectral normalization,\" \"language models,\" and \"state space,\" here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Applications of Spectral Normalization in Language Models\n\nSpectral normalization is a technique that can enhance the stability and generalization of neural networks, including language models. Here are some relevant points:\n\n- **Spectral Regularization**: This method is less sensitive to hyperparameters and demonstrates better training performance in individual tasks, sustaining trainability as new tasks arrive. It controls the deviation of the singular values of the parameter matrices, keeping the maximum singular value close to one. This approach has been shown to improve generalization and maintain trainability in continual learning settings, which could be beneficial for language models.\n\n- **Regularization Techniques**: In the context of LLM graph transformers, spectral normalization can be used alongside other regularization techniques such as dropout, graph diffusion, and graph spectral normalization to mitigate overfitting and over-smoothing. These techniques help in maintaining the model's performance and preventing it from becoming too specialized to the training data.\n\n## Integration of Spectral Methods with State Space Models\n\nThe integration of spectral methods with state space models can offer several advantages:\n\n- **Convolutional State Space Models**: These models can benefit from spectral processing techniques. For instance, using parallel scans and convolutional recurrences can achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. This integration can enhance the efficiency and scalability of state space models in language processing tasks[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Spectral state space models can be designed with hierarchical structures, which offer provable robustness properties and efficient implementation strategies. This hierarchical approach can be optimized for modern hardware, leveraging techniques like matrix decomposition and kernel fusion to reduce computational overhead[Analysis Note].\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Adjustment in Spectral Operations\n\nAdaptive parameter adjustment is crucial for optimizing the performance of spectral operations in language models:\n\n- **Adaptive Parameterization**: Models like NVAE use residual parameterization of Normal distributions, and their training is stabilized by spectral regularization. This adaptive approach helps in adjusting the parameters dynamically, ensuring that the model remains stable and performs well across different tasks[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Efficient Algorithms**: Using efficient and adaptive algorithms such as SGD, Adam, or AdaGrad, along with techniques like Bayesian optimization, grid search, or random search, can help in fine-tuning the model's parameters and hyperparameters. This adaptability is essential for optimizing the model's performance in various tasks and datasets.\n\n## Performance Benchmarks and Comparisons with Traditional Approaches\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of spectral normalization and state space models in language models, it is important to consider performance benchmarks:\n\n- **Performance Insights**: LLM graph transformers that integrate spectral normalization and other regularization techniques have shown enhanced accuracy in text classification tasks and improved handling of complex queries compared to conventional models. These models outperform traditional methods in various NLP tasks, indicating their potential in real-world applications.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The use of spectral methods and state space models can lead to significant efficiency gains. For example, techniques like L-Mul, which approximates floating-point multiplication using integer addition, can reduce computational resources and energy consumption, making the models more scalable and efficient for large-scale deployments.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of spectral normalization and state space models. This approach can lead to improved performance in various NLP tasks, better adaptability to new data, and enhanced efficiency in both training and inference.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/64 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n7462-7473 (cit. on p. 3).

Why Spectral Normalization Stabilizes GANs: Analysis and Improvements\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization neural networks*\n\n*Zinan Lin, Vyas Sekar, G. Fanti*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients, and proposes Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral normalization (SN) is a widely-used technique for improving the stability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by forcing each layer of the discriminator to have unit spectral norm. This approach controls the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator, and is empirically known to improve sample quality in many GAN architectures. However, there is currently little understanding of why SN is so effective. In this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization technique, proposed over two decades ago to control gradients in the training of deep neural networks. This connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs requires no hyperparameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, we show that SN tends to preserve this property throughout training. Finally, building on this theoretical understanding, we propose Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSN gives better gradient control than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that BSN outperforms SN in sample quality on several benchmark datasets, while also exhibiting better training stability.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Generalizable Adversarial Training via Spectral Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization neural networks*\n\n*Farzan Farnia, Jesse M. Zhang, David Tse*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the notion of margin loss to adversarial settings and bound the generalization error for DNNs trained under several well-known gradient-based attack schemes, motivating an effective regularization scheme based on spectral normalization of the DNN's weight matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have set benchmarks on a wide array of supervised learning tasks. Trained DNNs, however, often lack robustness to minor adversarial perturbations to the input, which undermines their true practicality. Recent works have increased the robustness of DNNs by fitting networks using adversarially-perturbed training samples, but the improved performance can still be far below the performance seen in non-adversarial settings. A significant portion of this gap can be attributed to the decrease in generalization performance due to adversarial training. In this work, we extend the notion of margin loss to adversarial settings and bound the generalization error for DNNs trained under several well-known gradient-based attack schemes, motivating an effective regularization scheme based on spectral normalization of the DNN's weight matrices. We also provide a computationally-efficient method for normalizing the spectral norm of convolutional layers with arbitrary stride and padding schemes in deep convolutional networks. We evaluate the power of spectral normalization extensively on combinations of datasets, network architectures, and adversarial training schemes.

Souza, Vikas Garg*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes the first generalization bound for EGNNs, and introduces a spectral norm regularizer tailored to EGNNs, demonstrating a high correlation between theoretical and empirical generalization gaps and the effectiveness of the proposed regularization scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** E ( n ) -Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EG-NNs) are among the most widely used and successful models for representation learning on geometric graphs (e.g., 3D molecules). However, while the expressivity of EGNNs has been explored in terms of geometric variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman isomorphism test, characterizing their generalization capability remains open. In this work, we establish the first generalization bound for EGNNs. Our bound depicts a dependence on the weighted sum of logarithms of the spectral norms of the weight matrices (EGNN parameters). In addition, our main result reveals interesting novel insights: i ) the spectral norms of the initial layers may impact generalization more than the final ones; ii ) \u03b5 -normalization is beneficial to generalization \u2014 confirming prior empirical evidence. We leverage these insights to introduce a spectral norm regularizer tailored to EGNNs.

Multi-Scale Adaptive Network for Single Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Yuanbiao Gou, Peng Hu, Jiancheng Lv, Xiaocui Peng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper reveals the missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and proposes a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising, which simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale architectures have shown effectiveness in a variety of tasks thanks to appealing cross-scale complementarity. However, existing architectures treat different scale features equally without considering the scale-specific characteristics, \\textit{i.e.}, the within-scale characteristics are ignored in the architecture design. In this paper, we reveal this missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. Specifically, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, \\textit{i.e.}, adaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive fusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively preserve image details and filter noises, which is highly expected for the features with mixed details and noises. AMB could enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information, which meets the need of contextually informative features. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features from one scale to another scale, which fuses the multi-scale features with varying characteristics from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on both three real and six synthetic noisy image datasets show the superiority of MSANet compared with 12 methods.

Pathformer: Multi-scale Transformers with Adaptive Pathways for Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Peng Chen, Yingying Zhang, Yunyao Cheng, Yang Shu, Yihang Wang, Qingsong Wen, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling and exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers for time series forecasting mainly model time series from limited or fixed scales, making it challenging to capture different characteristics spanning various scales. We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Tailin Wu, T. Maruyama, Qingqing Zhao, Gordon Wetzstein, J. Leskovec*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions.\n\n**Abstract:** Simulating the time evolution of physical systems is pivotal in many scientific and engineering problems. An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

Mean Spectral Normalization of Deep Neural Networks for Embedded Automation\n\n*From Search Query: spectral normalization neural networks*\n\n*Nak Young Chong, Anand Krishnamoorthy Subramanian*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have begun to thrive in the field of automation systems, owing to the recent advancements in standardising various aspects such as architecture, optimization techniques, and regularization. In this paper, we take a step towards a better understanding of Spectral Normalization (SN) and its potential for standardizing regularization of a wider range of Deep Learning models, following an empirical approach. We conduct several experiments to study their training dynamics, in comparison with the ubiquitous Batch Normalization (BN) and show that SN increases the gradient sparsity and controls the gradient variance. Furthermore, we show that SN suffers from a phenomenon, we call the mean-drift effect, which mitigates its performance. We, then, propose a weight reparameterization called as the Mean Spectral Normalization (MSN) to resolve the mean drift, thereby significantly improving the network's performance. Our model performs ~16% faster as compared to BN in practice, and has fewer trainable parameters. We also show the performance of our MSN for small, medium, and large CNNs - 3-layer CNN, VGG7 and DenseNet-BC, respectively - and unsupervised image generation tasks using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to evaluate its applicability for a broad range of embedded automation tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-09\n\n\n\n#### 2.

SNIPER: Efficient Multi-Scale Training\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Mahyar Najibi, Larry S. Davis, Bharat Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SNIPER, an algorithm for performing efficient multi-scale training\nin instance level visual recognition tasks. Instead of processing every pixel\nin an image pyramid, SNIPER processes context regions around ground-truth\ninstances (referred to as chips) at the appropriate scale. For background\nsampling, these context-regions are generated using proposals extracted from a\nregion proposal network trained with a short learning schedule. Hence, the\nnumber of chips generated per image during training adaptively changes based on\nthe scene complexity. SNIPER only processes 30% more pixels compared to the\ncommonly used single scale training at 800x1333 pixels on the COCO dataset.\nBut, it also observes samples from extreme resolutions of the image pyramid,\nlike 1400x2000 pixels. As SNIPER operates on resampled low resolution chips\n(512x512 pixels), it can have a batch size as large as 20 on a single GPU even\nwith a ResNet-101 backbone. Therefore it can benefit from batch-normalization\nduring training without the need for synchronizing batch-normalization\nstatistics across GPUs. SNIPER brings training of instance level recognition\ntasks like object detection closer to the protocol for image classification and\nsuggests that the commonly accepted guideline that it is important to train on\nhigh resolution images for instance level visual recognition tasks might not be\ncorrect. Our implementation based on Faster-RCNN with a ResNet-101 backbone\nobtains an mAP of 47.6% on the COCO dataset for bounding box detection and can\nprocess 5 images per second during inference with a single GPU.

PCPNET: Learning Local Shape Properties from Raw Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Maks Ovsjanikov, Yanir Kleiman, Paul Guerrero, Niloy J. Mitra*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose PCPNet, a deep-learning based approach for\nestimating local 3D shape properties in point clouds. In contrast to the\nmajority of prior techniques that concentrate on global or mid-level\nattributes, e.g., for shape classification or semantic labeling, we suggest a\npatch-based learning method, in which a series of local patches at multiple\nscales around each point is encoded in a structured manner. Our approach is\nespecially well-adapted for estimating local shape properties such as normals\n(both unoriented and oriented) and curvature from raw point clouds in the\npresence of strong noise and multi-scale features. Our main contributions\ninclude both a novel multi-scale variant of the recently proposed PointNet\narchitecture with emphasis on local shape information, and a series of novel\napplications in which we demonstrate how learning from training data arising\nfrom well-structured triangle meshes, and applying the trained model to noisy\npoint clouds can produce superior results compared to specialized\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our\napproach in the context of shape reconstruction, by showing how it can be used\nto extract normal orientation information from point clouds.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the concepts of spectral normalization, adaptive multi-scale normalization, and efficient implementation strategies, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Spectral Normalization in Neural Networks\n\n- **Spectral normalization** is a technique that rescales the weights of a layer by its spectral norm, which is the maximum singular value of the weight matrix. This method is commonly used to stabilize the training of neural networks, particularly in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other deep learning models.\n- In the context of continual learning, spectral regularization can maintain the trainability of neural networks by keeping the maximum singular value of each layer close to one, thus ensuring gradient diversity and promoting continual trainability.\n- This technique can be adapted to normalization layers in autoregressive language models to stabilize the training process and improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n## Integration of Spectral Filtering\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of spectral filtering with RMS normalization, the concept of spectral normalization can be extended to include spectral filtering. Spectral filtering involves manipulating the frequency-domain representation of the data, which can be achieved using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations.\n- The idea of combining spectral filtering with RMS normalization would involve applying spectral filtering to the input or intermediate representations in the neural network, potentially enhancing the model's ability to capture frequency-domain patterns. However, this would require careful analysis of the computational complexity and memory requirements, as well as its impact on gradient flow and training stability.\n\n## Adaptive Multi-Scale Normalization\n\n- **Adaptive multi-scale normalization** involves dynamically adjusting the normalization parameters based on the input data. This can be achieved through hierarchical normalization methods that aggregate features at multiple scales.\n- The concept of adaptive parameter adjustment can be seen in the learnable input normalization method proposed in one of the sources, where the transformation is parameterized as a curve and optimized alongside the neural network training. This approach uses B-splines to model the transformations, allowing for flexible and adaptive normalization.\n- For autoregressive language models, an adaptive multi-scale normalization approach could involve dynamically adjusting the normalization parameters based on the context and scale of the input sequence, potentially improving model stability and convergence.\n\n## Efficient Implementation of Spectral Operations\n\n- **Efficient FFT operations** are crucial for implementing spectral filtering in neural networks. Modern hardware, such as GPUs, can significantly speed up FFT operations through parallel processing and optimized memory access patterns.\n- The use of local spectral normalization, as opposed to global spectral normalization, can also reduce computational overhead by applying the normalization only to the output layer or specific layers of the network.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n- **Hardware-aware implementation** involves optimizing the model for the specific hardware it will run on. This includes optimizing memory access patterns, cache utilization, and leveraging parallel processing capabilities.\n- For FFT operations, using libraries optimized for the target hardware (e.g., PyTorch's implementation of spectral normalization) can significantly improve efficiency.\n\n### Recommendations for the Researcher\n\n1. **Spectral Filtering Integration**:\n   - Investigate how spectral filtering can be integrated with RMS normalization to enhance the capture of frequency-domain patterns in autoregressive language models.\n   - Analyze the computational complexity and memory requirements of this integration and its impact on training stability.\n\n2. **Adaptive Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n   - Develop a dynamic parameter adjustment mechanism for multi-scale feature aggregation, similar to the learnable input normalization approach.\n   - Study the impact of this approach on model stability, convergence, and memory-computation trade-offs.\n\n3. **Efficient Implementation**:\n   - Optimize FFT operations for modern hardware, leveraging parallel processing and optimized memory access.\n   - Implement local spectral normalization to reduce computational overhead.\n\n4. **Hardware-Aware Implementation**:\n   - Optimize the model for the target hardware, focusing on memory optimization, cache utilization, and parallel processing strategies.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researcher can potentially improve the autoregressive language model's performance, stability, and efficiency, especially in handling complex and varying data distributions.\n",

These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory. ## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a core problem in sequence prediction/modelling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Hop82, RHW ${ }^{+}$85, Elm90] are a natural choice, but are notoriously hard to train; they often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients [BSF94, PMB13] and despite techniques to mitigate the issue [HS97, $\\mathrm{CVMG}^{+}$14, ASB16], they are also hard to scale given the inherently sequential nature of their computation. In recent years, transformer models $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17 have become the staple of sequence modelling, achieving remarkable success across multiple domains $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+}\\right.$20, $\\mathrm{DBK}^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{JEP}^{+}$21]. Transformer models are naturally parallelizable and hence scale significantly better than RNNs. However, attention layers have memory/computation requirements that scale quadratically with context length. Many approximations have been proposed (see [TDBM22] for a recent survey). RNNs have seen a recent resurgence in the form of state space models (SSM) which have shown promise in modelling long sequences across varied modalities GGR21, $\\mathrm{DFS}^{+}$22, GGB22, $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23$, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23, GD23]. SSMs use linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the sequence-to sequence transform by evolving the internal state of a dynamical system according to the dynamics equations\n\n$$\nx_{t}=A x_{t-1}+B u_{t} \\quad y_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the hidden state of the dynamical system, $u_{t}$ is the input to the system, and $y_{t}$ are observations. The matrices $A, B, C, D$ govern the evolution of the system and are called system matrices. Despite its simplicity, this linear model can capture a rich set of natural dynamical systems\nin engineering and the physical sciences due to the potentially large number of hidden dimensions. Linear dynamical systems are also attractive as a sequence model because their structure is amenable to both fast inference and fast training via parallel scans [Ble89, SWL23] or convolutions [GGR21]. A rich literature stemming from control theory and recent machine learning interest has given rise to efficient techniques for system identification, filtering, and prediction for linear dynamical systems. For a survey of recent literature see [HS22]. These techniques make SSMs attractive for sequence tasks which inherently depend on long contexts that scale poorly for transformers. Examples include large language models [DFS ${ }^{+}$22], modelling time series [ZSP ${ }^{+}$23], and audio generation [GGDR22]. To understand the factors affecting the memory in an SSM or simply a linear dynamical system, we now proceed to delineate how past states and inputs affect the future. Geometric decay in LDS. The linear equations governing the dynamics are recursive in nature, and imply that in a noiseless environment, the $t$ 'th output can be written as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}=C\\left(A x_{t-1}+B u_{t}\\right)+D u_{t}=\\ldots=\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nThe matrix $A$ is asymmetric in general, and can have complex eigenvalues. If the amplitude of these eigenvalues is $>1$, then the output $y_{t}$ can grow without bounds. This is called an \"explosive\" system. In a well-behaved system, the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitude $<1$. If the magnitudes are bounded away from 1 , say $\\left|\\lambda_{i}(A)\\right|<1-\\delta$, for some $\\delta>0$ (referred to as spectral gap), then we can write\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+\\omega_{k},\\left\\|\\omega_{k}\\right\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor $k=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This mathematical fact implies that the effective memory of the system is on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$. In general, the parameter $\\delta$ is unknown apriori and can get arbitrarily small as we approach systems with have long range dependencies leading to instability in training linear dynamical systems with a long context. This issue is specifically highlighted in the work of [ $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+}$23] who observe that on long range tasks learning an LDS directly does not succeed and requires interventions such as stable exponential parameterizations and specific normalization which have been repeatedly used either implicitly or explicitly in the SSM literature [GGR21]. Unfortunately these reparametrizations and normalizations come with no theoretical guarantees. In fact this limitation is generally known to be fundamental to the use of linear dynamical systems, and can only be circumvented via a significant increase in sample complexity $\\left[\\mathrm{GLS}^{+}\\right.$20] or via control over the input sequence [SMT ${ }^{+}$18]. Spectral filtering for linear dynamical systems. A notable deviation from the standard theory of linear dynamical systems that allows efficient learning in the presence of arbitrarily long memory is the technique of spectral filtering [HSZ17]. The idea is to project the sequence of inputs to a small subspace that is constructed using special structure of discrete LDS where successive powers of the system matrix appear in the impulse response function. The basic idea is to represent the output as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} M_{j}\\left(\\sum_{i} \\phi_{j}(i) \\cdot u_{t-i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{j}$ are spectral filters which are sequence-length sized vectors that given the target sequence length can be computed offline, and $M_{j}$ are matrices parameterizing the model. These spectral-filters are the eigenvectors of the matrix constructed as the average of outer products of the discrete impulseresponse functions, viz $Z=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]^{\\top} d \\alpha$. It is shown that this matrix is inherently low-dimensional and for all $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, vectors of the form $\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]$ are well approximated by the top-eigenspace of Z. Figure 1 depicts these filters. For the details of how these filters are derived and their computation, see Section 2\n\nWhy is spectral filtering important? The main advantage of spectral filtering is that for certain types of linear dynamical systems, in particular those with symmetric matrices $A$, the effective memory(measured by the number of filters) required to represent an observation at any point in the sequence in the spectral basis is independent of the spectral gap parameter $\\delta!$. This guarantee indicates that if we featurize the input into the spectral basis, we can potentially design models that\nare capable of efficiently and stably representing systems with extremely long memory even with $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. This striking fact motivates our derivation of the recurrent spectral architecture, and is the underlying justification for the performance and training stability gains we see in experiments. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_28085b3c06af8ebfb6a7g-03.jpg?height=524&width=816&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=641)\n\nFigure 1: Spectral Filters used by the Spectral Filtering Algorithm. The x-axis is the time domain. ### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nWe start by proposing state space models with learned components that apply spectral filtering for their featurization. We consider two types of spectral filters, which augment the original spectral filters proposed in HSZ17] with negative eigenvalues in two different ways. Our main contribution is a neural architecture that is based on these spectral state space models. This neural architecture can be applied recursively in layers, resulting in an expressive architecture for modeling sequential data. Finally we implement this neural architecture and apply it towards synthetically generated data as well as the Long Range Arena benchmark [TDA ${ }^{+21]}$. We demonstrate that spectral state space models can stably and more efficiently learn on sequence modelling tasks with long range dependencies without the need for exponential parameterizations, particular initializations and normalizations. Main Advantages of Spectral SSM. Previously proposed convolutional models for sequence modeling, surveyed in the related work section, learn the kernels from the data. The kernels used in Spectral SSM are theoretically-founded and fixed and thus parameter-free. In addition, our models are provably as expressive as an LDS. In particular, their expressiveness neither depends on the spectra gap nor on the dimension of the system, which are necessary in all other methods. ### 1.2 Related work\n\nDue to limited space, we provide a short overview of the most related work to us below and provide a detailed report on the related work in the appendix (Section A). State space models. SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years starting with the works [GDE $\\left.{ }^{+} 20\\right],\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ which propose and develop the HiPPO theory. [GGR21] develop the S4 parameterization to address the bottlenecks of training efficiency, performance and numberical stability. The $S 4$ parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization. The S 4 model was further streamlined in later works, viz. using diagonal system matrices without a loss in performance [GGB22] and the S5 model [SWL23] which uses a MIMO diagonal system and associative scans for computational efficiency. [OSG $\\left.{ }^{+} 23\\right]$ investigate whether simpler deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer under the crucial caveat that specific modifications on linear RNNs, namely the stable exponential parameterization, $\\gamma$ - normalization and ring initialization, are necessary to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2. State-space models with layer-wise nonlinearity are universal approximators with exponential decaying memory (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/20 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nSiivola and A. Honkela. A state-space method for language modeling.

Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Hilbert Space Embeddings of Hidden Markov Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Le Song, Byron Boots, S. Siddiqi, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Alex Smola*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a nonparametric HMM that extends traditional HMMs to structured and non-Gaussian continuous distributions, and derives a local-minimum-free kernel spectral algorithm for learning these HMMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are important tools for modeling sequence data. However, they are restricted to discrete latent states, and are largely restricted to Gaussian and discrete observations. And, learning algorithms for HMMs have predominantly relied on local search heuristics, with the exception of spectral methods such as those described below. We propose a nonparametric HMM that extends traditional HMMs to structured and non-Gaussian continuous distributions. Furthermore, we derive a local-minimum-free kernel spectral algorithm for learning these HMMs. We apply our method to robot vision data, slot car inertial sensor data and audio event classification data, and show that in these applications, embedded HMMs exceed the previous state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2010\n\n**Citations:** 234  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 2. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Free-Form Variational Inference for Gaussian Process State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Xuhui Fan, Edwin V. Bonilla, T. O\u2019Kane, S. Sisson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new method for inference in Bayesian GPSSMs based on free-form variational inference via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within the inducing-variable formalism, and shows that it can learn transition dynamics and latent states more accurately than competing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Gaussian process state-space models (GPSSMs) provide a principled and flexible approach to modeling the dynamics of a latent state, which is observed at discrete-time points via a likelihood model. However, inference in GPSSMs is computationally and statistically challenging due to the large number of latent variables in the model and the strong temporal dependencies between them. In this paper, we propose a new method for inference in Bayesian GPSSMs, which overcomes the drawbacks of previous approaches, namely over-simplified assumptions, and high computational requirements. Our method is based on free-form variational inference via stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within the inducing-variable formalism. Furthermore, by exploiting our proposed variational distribution, we provide a collapsed extension of our method where the inducing variables are marginalized analytically. We also showcase results when combining our framework with particle MCMC methods. We show that, on six real-world datasets, our approach can learn transition dynamics and latent states more accurately than competing methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Latent State Space Models for Time-Series Generation\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Linqi Zhou, Michael Poli, Winnie Xu, Stefano Massaroli, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**TL;DR:** LS4 is proposed, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity, and sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Methods based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to build generative models of time-series. In addition to high computational overhead due to explicitly computing hidden states recurrence, existing ODE-based models fall short in learning sequence data with sharp transitions - common in many real-world systems - due to numerical challenges during optimization. In this work, we propose LS4, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity. Inspired by recent deep state space models (S4), we achieve speedups by leveraging a convolutional representation of LS4 which bypasses the explicit evaluation of hidden states. We show that LS4 significantly outperforms previous continuous-time generative models in terms of marginal distribution, classification, and prediction scores on real-world datasets in the Monash Forecasting Repository, and is capable of modeling highly stochastic data with sharp temporal transitions. LS4 sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets, while also being x100 faster than other baselines on long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. HSI-CNN: A Novel Convolution Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Chengfei Yao, Tao Li, Jie Zou, Gang Bai, Yanan Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** With the development of deep learning, the performance of hyperspectral image\n(HSI) classification has been greatly improved in recent years. The shortage of\ntraining samples has become a bottleneck for further improvement of\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network\nframework for the characteristics of hyperspectral image data, called HSI-CNN.\nFirstly, the spectral-spatial feature is extracted from a target pixel and its\nneighbors. Then, a number of one-dimensional feature maps, obtained by\nconvolution operation on spectral-spatial features, are stacked into a\ntwo-dimensional matrix. Finally, the two-dimensional matrix considered as an\nimage is fed into standard CNN. This is why we call it HSI-CNN. In addition, we\nalso implements two depth network classification models, called HSI-CNN+XGBoost\nand HSI-CapsNet, in order to compare the performance of our framework.\nExperiments show that the performance of hyperspectral image classification is\nimproved efficiently with HSI-CNN framework. We evaluate the model's\nperformance using four popular HSI datasets, which are the Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University scene (PU) and Salinas scene (SA).\nAs far as we concerned, HSI-CNN has got the state-of-art accuracy among all\nmethods we have known on these datasets of 99.28%, 99.09%, 99.42%, 98.95%\nseparately.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. A spectral synthesis code for rapid modelling of supernovae\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We present TARDIS - an open-source code for rapid spectral modelling of supernovae (SNe). Our goal is to develop a tool that is sufficiently fast to allow exploration of the complex parameter spaces of models for SN ejecta. This can be used to analyse the growing number of high-quality SN spectra being obtained by transient surveys. The code uses Monte Carlo methods to obtain a self-consistent description of the plasma state and to compute a synthetic spectrum. It has a modular design to facilitate the implementation of a range of physical approximations that can be compared to asses both accuracy and computational expediency. This will allow users to choose a level of sophistication appropriate for their application. Here, we describe the operation of the code and make comparisons with alternative radiative transfer codes of differing levels of complexity (SYN++, PYTHON, and ARTIS). We then explore the consequence of adopting simple prescriptions for the calculation of atomic excitation, focussing on four species of relevance to Type Ia supernova spectra - Si II, S II, Mg II, and Ca II. We also investigate the influence of three methods for treating line interactions on our synthetic spectra and the need for accurate radiative rate estimates in our scheme.\n\n**Published:** 2014-01-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multiresolution Graph Transformers and Wavelet Positional Encoding for Learning Hierarchical Structures\n\n*From Search Query: state space models spectral methods*\n\n*Risi Kondor, Truong Son Hy, Nhat Khang Ngo*\n\n**Abstract:** Contemporary graph learning algorithms are not well-defined for large molecules since they do not consider the hierarchical interactions among the atoms, which are essential to determine the molecular properties of macromolecules. In this work, we propose Multiresolution Graph Transformers (MGT), the first graph transformer architecture that can learn to represent large molecules at multiple scales. MGT can learn to produce representations for the atoms and group them into meaningful functional groups or repeating units. We also introduce Wavelet Positional Encoding (WavePE), a new positional encoding method that can guarantee localization in both spectral and spatial domains. Our proposed model achieves competitive results on two macromolecule datasets consisting of polymers and peptides, and one drug-like molecule dataset. Importantly, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves chemical accuracy in estimating molecular properties (e.g., GAP, HOMO and LUMO) calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the polymers dataset. Furthermore, the visualizations, including clustering results on macromolecules and low-dimensional spaces of their representations, demonstrate the capability of our methodology in learning to represent long-range and hierarchical structures.

It highlights the potential of using state space models to capture temporal dynamics, which can be extended to incorporate spectral methods. For instance, the state space formulation can include spectral components to model the correlations of graph signals at different frequencies, similar to the approach in graph neural networks.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Spectral Operations\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly address memory-efficient spectral operations in state space models, the concept of efficient spectral processing can be inferred from other contexts. For example, the \"FlashFFTConv\" approach mentioned in your analysis demonstrates efficient FFT convolutions, which could be adapted for spectral operations within state space models. This involves optimizing hardware utilization, memory access patterns, and cache efficiency.\n\n## Applications of Spectral Methods in Language Modeling\n\n- There is no direct mention of spectral methods in language modeling within the provided sources. However, the integration of spectral methods into state space models for language modeling can be conceptualized by drawing parallels from other domains. For instance, the use of spectral normalization in stabilizing training and preventing exploding/vanishing gradients, as mentioned in your analysis, could be extended to state space models in language modeling. This would involve incorporating spectral normalization layers within the state space model architecture to enhance stability and generalization.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Spectral State Space Models\n\n- The paper \"What Can We Learn from State Space Models for Machine Learning\" provides a theoretical foundation for state space models and their application in machine learning. It discusses how state space models can capture the temporal dynamics of systems, which can be theoretically extended to include spectral components. This approach aligns with the internal workings of neural networks, where hidden representations can be viewed as state variables. Theoretical analysis would involve exploring how spectral methods can enhance the expressive power and stability of state space models in the context of language modeling.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **IGroupSS-Mamba Framework**: While not directly focused on language models, the \"IGroupSS-Mamba\" framework demonstrates how selective state space models can be used for long-range sequence modeling in hyperspectral image classification. This framework's approach to partitioning high-dimensional features into groups and integrating spectral-spatial information could inspire similar strategies for language models, particularly in handling long-range dependencies and multi-scale processing.\n\n- **Graph Neural Networks**: The application of state space models in graph neural networks shows promise in modeling complex, time-evolving relationships. This can be a valuable analogy for language models, where the sequential nature of text data can be modeled using state space formulations that incorporate spectral methods to capture different frequency components of the input data.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that leverage state space models with spectral components, ensuring memory-efficient implementations, stability, and improved performance in handling complex sequential data.\n",

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/46 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2023.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\\times$256 pixels.

Evaluating hierarchical generalization in neural networks trained on child-directed speech\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Aditya Yedetore, Tal Linzen, R. Frank, R. Thomas McCoy*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is suggested that human-like generalization from text alone requires stronger biases than the general sequence-processing biases of standard neural network architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** When acquiring syntax, children consistently choose hierarchical rules over competing non-hierarchical possibilities. Is this preference due to a learning bias for hierarchical structure, or due to more general biases that interact with hierarchical cues in children\u2019s linguistic input? We explore these possibilities by training LSTMs and Transformers - two types of neural networks without a hierarchical bias - on data similar in quantity and content to children\u2019s linguistic input: text from the CHILDES corpus. We then evaluate what these models have learned about English yes/no questions, a phenomenon for which hierarchical structure is crucial. We find that, though they perform well at capturing the surface statistics of child-directed speech (as measured by perplexity), both model types generalize in a way more consistent with an incorrect linear rule than the correct hierarchical rule. These results suggest that human-like generalization from text alone requires stronger biases than the general sequence-processing biases of standard neural network architectures.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Differentiable hierarchical and surrogate gradient search for spiking neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Kaiwei Che, Luziwei Leng, Kaixuan Zhang, Jianguo Zhang, Qinghu Meng, Jie Cheng, Qinghai Guo, Jianxing Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike- based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space, which finds effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost and exceeds the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural network (SNN) has been viewed as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are achieving competitive performances in benchmark tasks such as image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not necessary ideal for SNN and when tasks become more diverse effective architectural variations could be critical. To this end, we develop a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based computation is realized on both the cell and the layer level search space. Based on this framework, we find effective SNN architectures under limited computation cost. During the training of SNN, a suboptimal surrogate gradient function could lead to poor approximations of true gradients, making the network enter certain local minima. To address this problem, we extend the differential approach to surrogate gradient search where the SG function is efficiently optimized locally. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performances on classification of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracy of 95.50%, 76.25% and 68.64%. On event-based deep stereo, our method finds optimal layer variation and surpasses the accuracy of specially designed ANNs meanwhile with 26 \u00d7 lower energy cost ( 6 . 7mJ ), demonstrating the advantage of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.

Provable Guarantees for Nonlinear Feature Learning in Three-Layer Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Eshaan Nichani, Alexandru Damian, Jason D. Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work analyzes the features learned by a three-layer network trained with layer-wise gradient descent, and presents a general purpose theorem which upper bounds the sample complexity and width needed to achieve low test error when the target has specific hierarchical structure.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the central questions in the theory of deep learning is to understand how neural networks learn hierarchical features. The ability of deep networks to extract salient features is crucial to both their outstanding generalization ability and the modern deep learning paradigm of pretraining and finetuneing. However, this feature learning process remains poorly understood from a theoretical perspective, with existing analyses largely restricted to two-layer networks. In this work we show that three-layer neural networks have provably richer feature learning capabilities than two-layer networks. We analyze the features learned by a three-layer network trained with layer-wise gradient descent, and present a general purpose theorem which upper bounds the sample complexity and width needed to achieve low test error when the target has specific hierarchical structure. We instantiate our framework in specific statistical learning settings -- single-index models and functions of quadratic features -- and show that in the latter setting three-layer networks obtain a sample complexity improvement over all existing guarantees for two-layer networks. Crucially, this sample complexity improvement relies on the ability of three-layer networks to efficiently learn nonlinear features. We then establish a concrete optimization-based depth separation by constructing a function which is efficiently learnable via gradient descent on a three-layer network, yet cannot be learned efficiently by a two-layer network. Our work makes progress towards understanding the provable benefit of three-layer neural networks over two-layer networks in the feature learning regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Representation Learning in Graph Neural Networks with Node Decimation Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Cesare Alippi, Filippo Maria Bianchi, Lorenzo Livi, Daniele Grattarola*\n\n**Abstract:** In graph neural networks (GNNs), pooling operators compute local summaries of input graphs to capture their global properties, and they are fundamental for building deep GNNs that learn hierarchical representations. In this work, we propose the Node Decimation Pooling (NDP), a pooling operator for GNNs that generates coarser graphs while preserving the overall graph topology. During training, the GNN learns new node representations and fits them to a pyramid of coarsened graphs, which is computed offline in a pre-processing stage. NDP consists of three steps. First, a node decimation procedure selects the nodes belonging to one side of the partition identified by a spectral algorithm that approximates the \\maxcut{} solution. Afterwards, the selected nodes are connected with Kron reduction to form the coarsened graph. Finally, since the resulting graph is very dense, we apply a sparsification procedure that prunes the adjacency matrix of the coarsened graph to reduce the computational cost in the GNN. Notably, we show that it is possible to remove many edges without significantly altering the graph structure. Experimental results show that NDP is more efficient compared to state-of-the-art graph pooling operators while reaching, at the same time, competitive performance on a significant variety of graph classification tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. RawNeXt: Speaker verification system for variable-duration utterances with deep layer aggregation and extended dynamic scaling policies\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Ha-Jin Yu, Jungwoo Heo, Hye-jin Shim, Ju-ho Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite achieving satisfactory performance in speaker verification using deep neural networks, variable-duration utterances remain a challenge that threatens the robustness of systems. To deal with this issue, we propose a speaker verification system called RawNeXt that can handle input raw waveforms of arbitrary length by employing the following two components: (1) A deep layer aggregation strategy enhances speaker information by iteratively and hierarchically aggregating features of various time scales and spectral channels output from blocks. (2) An extended dynamic scaling policy flexibly processes features according to the length of the utterance by selectively merging the activations of different resolution branches in each block. Owing to these two components, our proposed model can extract speaker embeddings rich in time-spectral information and operate dynamically on length variations. Experimental results on the VoxCeleb1 test set consisting of various duration utterances demonstrate that RawNeXt achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the recently proposed systems.

RDFNet: Regional Dynamic FISTA-Net for Spectral Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical spectral processing neural networks*\n\n*Jianan Li, Shaocong Dong, Tingfa Xu, Shiyun Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks have recently shown promising results in compressive spectral reconstruction. Previous methods, however, usually adopt a single mapping function for sparse representation. Considering that different regions have distinct characteristics, it is desirable to apply various mapping functions to adjust different regions' transformations dynamically. With this in mind, we first introduce a regional dynamic way of using Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) to exploit regional characteristics and derive dynamic sparse representations. Then, we propose to unfold the process into a hierarchical dynamic deep network, dubbed RDFNet. The network comprises multiple regional dynamic blocks and corresponding pixel-wise adaptive soft-thresholding modules, respectively in charge of region-based dynamic mapping and pixel-wise soft-thresholding selection. The regional dynamic block guides the network to adjust the transformation domain for different regions. Equipped with the adaptive soft-thresholding, our proposed regional dynamic architecture can also learn appropriate shrinkage scale in a pixel-wise manner. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that our method outperforms prior state-of-the-arts.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the keywords and details provided, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Hierarchical and Multi-scale Processing in Spectral Domain\n\n- **Spectral State Space Models**: These models combine spectral filtering with state space models, which can be beneficial for handling long-range dependencies in sequential data. They have provable robustness properties and do not require learning the convolutional filters, making them efficient for hierarchical processing.\n- **Recursive Neural Networks**: While not specifically focused on spectral processing, recursive neural networks can handle hierarchical relationships in data, which is relevant for multi-scale processing. They can capture complex dependencies and interactions within structured data, such as natural language processing tasks.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Spectral Operations in Neural Networks\n\n- **Efficient FFT Operations**: For spectral state space models, efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations are crucial. Implementations that optimize FFT can significantly reduce computational and memory costs. This can be achieved through parallel processing and optimized algorithms for FFT.\n- **Memory-Computation Trade-offs**: In models like the HSI retentive network (HSIRN), memory usage is managed independently of the token's size, which can be a useful strategy for memory-efficient spectral operations in neural networks. This approach ensures that memory usage does not scale linearly with the input size.\n\n## Integration of Spectral Methods with Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization**: Combining spectral methods with hierarchical normalization techniques can enhance the robustness and performance of the model. This integration can help in multi-scale feature representation and adaptive parameter adjustment, which are crucial for handling diverse data inputs.\n- **State Space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity**: These models can be universal approximators with exponential decaying memory, which suggests that integrating spectral methods with layer-wise normalization could improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and handle complex data structures.\n\n## Hardware Optimization for Spectral Operations in Deep Learning\n\n- **Parallel Processing Opportunities**: Spectral state space models and convolutional state space models can benefit from parallel scans and subquadratic parallelization, which can significantly speed up autoregressive generation and other spectral operations. This is particularly important for hardware optimization to leverage multi-core processors and GPUs.\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Optimizing spectral operations for specific hardware architectures, such as using GPU-accelerated FFT libraries, can further enhance the efficiency and scalability of the model. This involves tailoring the implementation to take advantage of the hardware's capabilities, such as parallel processing and memory management.\n\nIn summary, the integration of spectral methods with hierarchical and multi-scale processing, efficient FFT operations, memory-efficient normalization techniques, and hardware optimization strategies can significantly improve the design and performance of autoregressive language models. These approaches can enhance robustness, reduce dependency on spectrum properties, and enable efficient processing of long sequences, all of which are critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance in language modeling.\n",

Motivation\n\nAutoregressive language models have achieved significant success in natural language processing tasks. However, as these models scale up, they encounter challenges related to feature representation, training stability, and computational efficiency. Traditional hierarchical normalization methods, while effective in maintaining normalized feature distributions across network layers, often lack the ability to selectively emphasize important frequency components and adapt to varying data distributions. Spectral filtering and adaptive normalization techniques offer promising avenues to enhance these aspects. By integrating spectral filtering and adaptive multi-scale normalization into hierarchical RMS normalization, we aim to create a more robust and efficient normalization layer that can better capture both local and global dependencies, stabilize training, and optimize computational resources.\n\n### 2.
