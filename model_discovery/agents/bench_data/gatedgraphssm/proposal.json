State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

(2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

However, typically the retriever is not trained jointly as a native component of the LM, but added post-hoc to an already-pretrained LM, which limits the ability of the LM and the retriever to adapt to one another. In this work, we propose the Retrieval-Pretrained Transformer (RPT), an architecture and training procedure for jointly training a retrieval-augmented LM from scratch and apply it to the task of modeling long texts. Given a recently generated text chunk in a long document, the LM computes query representations, which are then used to retrieve earlier chunks in the document, located potentially tens of thousands of tokens before. Information from retrieved chunks is fused into the LM representations to predict the next target chunk. We train the retriever component with a semantic objective, where the goal is to retrieve chunks that increase the probability of the next chunk, according to a reference LM. We evaluate RPT on four long-range language modeling tasks, spanning books, code, and mathematical writing, and demonstrate that RPT improves retrieval quality and subsequently perplexity across the board compared to strong baselines.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/34 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of $A C L$.

Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated convolution language models\"*\n\n*Sheng Shen, Z. Yao, Chunyuan Li, Trevor Darrell, K. Keutzer, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** The effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models is explored, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

We redefine the task as text promptable, thereby enabling a more nuanced comprehension of surgical instruments and adaptability to new instrument types. Inspired by recent advancements in vision-language models, we leverage pretrained image and text encoders as our model backbone and design a text promptable mask decoder consisting of attention- and convolution-based prompting schemes for surgical instrument segmentation prediction. Our model leverages multiple text prompts for each surgical instrument through a new mixture of prompts mechanism, resulting in enhanced segmentation performance. Additionally, we introduce a hard instrument area reinforcement module to improve image feature comprehension and segmentation precision. Extensive experiments on several surgical instrument segmentation datasets demonstrate our model's superior performance and promising generalization capability. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a promptable approach to surgical instrument segmentation, offering significant potential for practical application in the field of robotic-assisted surgery.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Current approaches to VLP heavily rely on image feature extraction processes, most of which involve region supervision (e.g., object detection) and the convolutional architecture (e.g., ResNet). Although disregarded in the literature, we find it problematic in terms of both (1) efficiency/speed, that simply extracting input features requires much more computation than the multimodal interaction steps; and (2) expressive power, as it is upper bounded to the expressive power of the visual embedder and its predefined visual vocabulary. In this paper, we present a minimal VLP model, Vision-and-Language Transformer (ViLT), monolithic in the sense that the processing of visual inputs is drastically simplified to just the same convolution-free manner that we process textual inputs. We show that ViLT is up to tens of times faster than previous VLP models, yet with competitive or better downstream task performance.

A structure-enhanced graph convolutional network for sentiment analysis\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Fanyu Meng, Feng Junlan, Danping Yin, Si Chen, Min Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel weighted graph convolutional network (WGCN) which can exploit rich syntactic information based on the feature combination and utilize BERT instead of Bi-LSTM to generate contextualized representations as inputs for GCN and present an alignment method to keep word-level dependencies consistent with wordpiece unit of BERT.\n\n**Abstract:** Syntactic information is essential for both sentiment analysis(SA) and aspect-based sentiment analysis(ABSA). Previous work has already achieved great progress utilizing Graph Convolutional Network(GCN) over dependency tree of a sentence. However, these models do not fully exploit the syntactic information obtained from dependency parsing such as the diversified types of dependency relations. The message passing process of GCN should be distinguished based on these syntactic information.To tackle this problem, we design a novel weighted graph convolutional network(WGCN) which can exploit rich syntactic information based on the feature combination. Furthermore, we utilize BERT instead of Bi-LSTM to generate contextualized representations as inputs for GCN and present an alignment method to keep word-level dependencies consistent with wordpiece unit of BERT. With our proposal, we are able to improve the state-of-the-art on four ABSA tasks out of six and two SA tasks out of three.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. AutoGO: Automated Computation Graph Optimization for Neural Network Evolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Mohammad Salameh, Keith G.

Han, Shuting Zhang, Wei Lu, Shangling Jui, Chunhua Zhou, Fengyu Sun, Di Niu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness, is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to obtain high-quality models for efficient real-world deployment has posed multi-faceted challenges to machine learning engineers. Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

Non-local and non-sequential context is, however, a valuable source of information to improve predictions. In this paper, we introduce GraphIE, a framework that operates over a graph representing a broad set of dependencies between textual units (i.e. words or sentences). The algorithm propagates information between connected nodes through graph convolutions, generating a richer representation that can be exploited to improve word-level predictions. Evaluation on three different tasks \u2014 namely textual, social media and visual information extraction \u2014 shows that GraphIE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence tagging model by a significant margin.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 7. Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Yaofo Chen, S. Zheng, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An active sample selection criterion is proposed to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation, and a Fisher regularizer is introduced to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 226  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 8. Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Super-Resolution with Second-Order Degradation and Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Zeshuai Deng, Zhuokun Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Thomas H. Li, Bohan Zhuang, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR is presented, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types, and designs a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier.\n\n**Abstract:** Image super-resolution (SR) aims to learn a mapping from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) using paired HR-LR training images. Conventional SR methods typically gather the paired training data by synthesizing LR images from HR images using a predetermined degradation model, e.g., Bicubic down-sampling. However, the realistic degradation type of test images may mismatch with the training-time degradation type due to the dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios, resulting in inferior-quality SR images. To address this, existing methods attempt to estimate the degradation model and train an image-specific model, which, however, is quite time-consuming and impracticable to handle rapidly changing domain shifts. Moreover, these methods largely concentrate on the estimation of one degradation type (e.g., blur degradation), overlooking other degradation types like noise and JPEG in real-world test-time scenarios, thus limiting their practicality. To tackle these problems, we present an efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types. Specifically, we design a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, which is predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier. Then, we adapt the SR model by implementing feature-level reconstruction learning from the initial test image to its second-order degraded counterparts, which helps the SR model generate plausible HR images. Extensive experiments are conducted on newly synthesized corrupted DIV2K datasets with 8 different degradations and several real-world datasets, demonstrating that our SRTTA framework achieves an impressive improvement over existing methods with satisfying speed.

Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated convolution language models\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling.

An Attention-Gated Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence\n  Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated convolution language models\"*\n\n*Yang Liu, Lixin Ji, Ruiyang Huang, Tuosiyu Ming, Chao Gao, Jianpeng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The classification of sentences is very challenging, since sentences contain\nthe limited contextual information. In this paper, we proposed an\nAttention-Gated Convolutional Neural Network (AGCNN) for sentence\nclassification, which generates attention weights from the feature's context\nwindows of different sizes by using specialized convolution encoders. It makes\nfull use of limited contextual information to extract and enhance the influence\nof important features in predicting the sentence's category. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that our model can achieve up to 3.1% higher accuracy than\nstandard CNN models, and gain competitive results over the baselines on four\nout of the six tasks. Besides, we designed an activation function, namely,\nNatural Logarithm rescaled Rectified Linear Unit (NLReLU).

Geometry-Aware Supertagging with Heterogeneous Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Michael Moortgat*\n\n**Abstract:** The syntactic categories of categorial grammar formalisms are structured\nunits made of smaller, indivisible primitives, bound together by the underlying\ngrammar's category formation rules. In the trending approach of constructive\nsupertagging, neural models are increasingly made aware of the internal\ncategory structure, which in turn enables them to more reliably predict rare\nand out-of-vocabulary categories, with significant implications for grammars\npreviously deemed too complex to find practical use. In this work, we revisit\nconstructive supertagging from a graph-theoretic perspective, and propose a\nframework based on heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutions aimed at exploiting\nthe distinctive structure of a supertagger's output space. We test our approach\non a number of categorial grammar datasets spanning different languages and\ngrammar formalisms, achieving substantial improvements over previous state of\nthe art scores.

Recursive Non-Autoregressive Graph-to-Graph Transformer for Dependency\n  Parsing with Iterative Refinement\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Alireza Mohammadshahi, James Henderson*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Recursive Non-autoregressive Graph-to-Graph Transformer\narchitecture (RNGTr) for the iterative refinement of arbitrary graphs through\nthe recursive application of a non-autoregressive Graph-to-Graph Transformer\nand apply it to syntactic dependency parsing. We demonstrate the power and\neffectiveness of RNGTr on several dependency corpora, using a refinement model\npre-trained with BERT. We also introduce Syntactic Transformer (SynTr), a\nnon-recursive parser similar to our refinement model. RNGTr can improve the\naccuracy of a variety of initial parsers on 13 languages from the Universal\nDependencies Treebanks, English and Chinese Penn Treebanks, and the German\nCoNLL2009 corpus, even improving over the new state-of-the-art results achieved\nby SynTr, significantly improving the state-of-the-art for all corpora tested.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-29T19:25:32Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-10T17:05:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Investigating Uncertainty Calibration of Aligned Language Models under\n  the Multiple-Choice Setting\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Guande He, Peng Cui, Jianfei Chen, Wenbo Hu, Jun Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the significant progress made in practical applications of aligned\nlanguage models (LMs), they tend to be overconfident in output answers compared\nto the corresponding pre-trained LMs. In this work, we systematically evaluate\nthe impact of the alignment process on logit-based uncertainty calibration of\nLMs under the multiple-choice setting. We first conduct a thoughtful empirical\nstudy on how aligned LMs differ in calibration from their pre-trained\ncounterparts. Experimental results reveal that there are two distinct\nuncertainties in LMs under the multiple-choice setting, which are responsible\nfor the answer decision and the format preference of the LMs, respectively.\nThen, we investigate the role of these two uncertainties on aligned LM's\ncalibration through fine-tuning in simple synthetic alignment schemes and\nconclude that one reason for aligned LMs' overconfidence is the conflation of\nthese two types of uncertainty. Furthermore, we examine the utility of common\npost-hoc calibration methods for aligned LMs and propose an easy-to-implement\nand sample-efficient method to calibrate aligned LMs. We hope our findings\ncould provide insights into the design of more reliable alignment processes for\nLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18T06:07:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-19T12:40:41Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. On the Effect of (Near) Duplicate Subwords in Language Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Anton Sch\u00e4fer, Thomas Hofmann, Imanol Schlag, Tiago Pimentel*\n\n**Abstract:** Tokenisation is a core part of language models (LMs). It involves splitting a\ncharacter sequence into subwords which are assigned arbitrary indices before\nbeing served to the LM. While typically lossless, however, this process may\nlead to less sample efficient LM training: as it removes character-level\ninformation, it could make it harder for LMs to generalise across similar\nsubwords, such as now and Now. We refer to such subwords as near duplicates. In\nthis paper, we study the impact of near duplicate subwords on LM training\nefficiency. First, we design an experiment that gives us an upper bound to how\nmuch we should expect a model to improve if we could perfectly generalise\nacross near duplicates. We do this by duplicating each subword in our LM's\nvocabulary, creating perfectly equivalent classes of subwords. Experimentally,\nwe find that LMs need roughly 17% more data when trained in a fully duplicated\nsetting. Second, we investigate the impact of naturally occurring near\nduplicates on LMs. Here, we see that merging them considerably hurts LM\nperformance. Therefore, although subword duplication negatively impacts LM\ntraining efficiency, naturally occurring near duplicates may not be as similar\nas anticipated, limiting the potential for performance improvements.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-09T17:57:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-17T17:39:39Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated convolution language models\"*\n\n*Michael Auli, David Grangier, Angela Fan, Yann N. Dauphin*\n\n**Abstract:** The pre-dominant approach to language modeling to date is based on recurrent\nneural networks. Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to\ncapture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach\nthrough stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow\nparallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating\nmechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key\narchitectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the\nWikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well\nas competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated convolution language models\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Irregular Traffic Time Series Forecasting Based on Asynchronous Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Yanjie Fu, Hui Xiong, Yu Mei, Jingbo Zhou, Hao liu, Jindong Han, Le Zhang, Weijia Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate traffic forecasting is crucial for the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), playing a pivotal role in modern urban traffic management. Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Editing Factual Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Ivan Titov, Wilker Aziz, Nicola De Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** The factual knowledge acquired during pre-training and stored in the parameters of Language Models (LMs) can be useful in downstream tasks (e.g., question answering or textual inference). However, some facts can be incorrectly induced or become obsolete over time. We present KnowledgeEditor, a method which can be used to edit this knowledge and, thus, fix 'bugs' or unexpected predictions without the need for expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Besides being computationally efficient, KnowledgeEditordoes not require any modifications in LM pre-training (e.g., the use of meta-learning). In our approach, we train a hyper-network with constrained optimization to modify a fact without affecting the rest of the knowledge; the trained hyper-network is then used to predict the weight update at test time. We show KnowledgeEditor's efficacy with two popular architectures and knowledge-intensive tasks: i) a BERT model fine-tuned for fact-checking, and ii) a sequence-to-sequence BART model for question answering. With our method, changing a prediction on the specific wording of a query tends to result in a consistent change in predictions also for its paraphrases. We show that this can be further encouraged by exploiting (e.g., automatically-generated) paraphrases during training. Interestingly, our hyper-network can be regarded as a 'probe' revealing which components need to be changed to manipulate factual knowledge; our analysis shows that the updates tend to be concentrated on a small subset of components.

TDD Without Tears: Towards Test Case Generation from Requirements through Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Efficient test-time training in LMs\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Test-driven development (TDD) is a widely-employed software development practice that mandates writing test cases based on requirements before writing the actual code. While writing test cases is the centerpiece of TDD, it is time-consuming, expensive, and often shunned by developers. To address these issues associated with TDD, automated test case generation approaches have recently been investigated. Such approaches take source code as input, but not the requirements. Therefore, existing work does not fully support true TDD, as actual code is required to generate test cases. In addition, current deep learning-based test case generation approaches are trained with one learning objective, i.e., to generate test cases that are exactly matched with the ground-truth test cases. However, such approaches may limit the model's ability to generate different yet correct test cases. In this paper, we introduce PyTester, a Text-to-Testcase generation approach that can automatically generate syntactically correct, executable, complete, and effective test cases while being aligned with a given natural language requirement. We evaluate PyTester on the public APPS benchmark dataset, and the results show that our Deep RL approach enables PyTester, a small language model, to outperform much larger language models like GPT3.5, StarCoder, and InCoder. Our findings suggest that future research could consider improving small over large LMs for better resource efficiency by integrating the SE domain knowledge into the design of reinforcement learning architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates gating mechanisms and graph convolutional operations, here are some key insights and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Gating Mechanisms\n- **Gated Linear Units (GLUs):** GLUs combine linear and gating mechanisms to control the flow of information. They are particularly useful in sequential data tasks and have been shown to improve performance in language modeling by adaptively selecting the information passed through the network. This is detailed in the work by Dauphin et al. (2017) and further explored in variations such as SwiGLU, which replaces the sigmoid function with the Swish activation function.\n\n### Graph Convolutional Operations\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss graph convolutional operations within the context of autoregressive LMs, the concept of using convolutional layers to capture local contextual features is relevant. For example, the Convolutional with Attention Gated Recurrent Network (CAGRN) model uses CNN layers to extract local contextual features, which could be a starting point for integrating graph convolutions to capture more complex relational dependencies.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- **Transformer Architectures:** The Transformer architecture, which relies heavily on self-attention mechanisms, has shown great scalability and efficiency in large language models. Integrating gating mechanisms within Transformer blocks, such as the Gated Transformer Blocks proposed in the \\modelname architecture, could offer a balanced approach to capturing both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n- **Optimization Techniques:** To ensure computational efficiency, techniques such as those used in the Transformer models (e.g., multi-head attention, feed-forward networks) can be adapted. Additionally, optimizing the gating mechanisms and graph convolutions to minimize computational overhead is crucial. The use of variants like SwiGLU, which do not introduce significant computational drawbacks, can be beneficial.\n\n### Test-Time Training Adaptability\n- **Prompt Engineering and Attention Mechanisms:** The use of attention mechanisms and prompt engineering in large language models has shown significant improvements in adaptability during test-time.

For instance, the use of GLU variants in Transformer models has shown improvements without introducing significant computational drawbacks.\n\n#### Empirical Studies\n- Seek out empirical studies that evaluate the impact of gating and graph convolutions on model performance, efficiency, and scalability. This could include studies on the CAGRN model and other similar architectures that integrate convolutional and recurrent components.\n\n### Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms in Transformers:** The integration of GLUs within Transformer blocks can enhance the model's ability to capture complex dependencies. This is demonstrated in the \\modelname architecture, where gated transformer blocks are used to capture spatiotemporal dynamics, which can be adapted for language modeling.\n\n- **Graph Convolutional Operations:** While not directly addressed in the provided sources, the concept of using convolutional layers to capture local features can be extended to graph convolutions. This would allow the model to capture hierarchical and relational dependencies in language data more effectively.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:** Balancing the integration of these mechanisms with computational efficiency is crucial.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.75)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 57/74 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\n2019.

In: arXiv preprint arXiv:2212.08136 (2022). ## A Discussion: Selection Mechanism\n\nOur selection mechanism is inspired by and related to concepts such as gating, hypernetworks, and data-dependence. It can also be viewed as related to \"fast weights\" (J. Ba et al. 2016; Schmidhuber 1992), which connects classical RNNs with the mechanism of linear attention (Schlag, Irie, and Schmidhuber 2021). However, we believe that it is a distinct concept that is worth clarifying. Gating. Gating originally referred to the gating mechanisms of RNNs such as the LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber 1997) and GRU (J. Chung et al. 2014), or the gated equation (5) in Theorem 1. This was interpreted as a particular mechanism for controlling whether to let an input into the hidden state of an RNN. In particular, this affects the propagation of signal through time and causes inputs to interact along the sequence length dimension. However, the concept of gating has since been relaxed in popular usage to simply mean any multiplicative interaction (often with an activation function). For example, elementwise multiplicative components of neural network architectures (that do not interact along sequence length) are now commonly referred to as gated architectures (Hua et al. 2022; Mehta et al. 2023), despite a very different meaning than the original RNN sense. Thus we believe the original concept of $R N N$ gating versus the popular usage of multiplicative gating actually have a very different semantic meaning. Hypernetworks. Hypernetworks refer to neural networks whose parameters are themselves generated by smaller neural networks. The original idea (Ha, Dai, and Quoc V. Le 2017) used it in a narrow sense to define a large RNN whose recurrent parameters are generated by a smaller RNN, and other variants have been around for a long time (Schmidhuber 1992). Data-dependence. Similar to hypernetworks, data-dependence can refer to any notion where some parameters of the model depend on the data (Poli et al. 2023). Example: GLU Activation. To illustrate the issues with these concepts, consider a simple diagonal linear layer $y=D x$, where $D$ is a diagonal weight parameter. Now suppose that $D$ is itself generated from a linear transformation of $x$, with an optional nonlinearity: $D=\\sigma(\\boldsymbol{W} x)$. Since it is diagonal, the multiplication becomes an elementwise product: $y=\\sigma(W x) \\circ x$. This is a rather trivial transformation, yet it technically satisfies the common meanings of gating (since it has a multiplicative \"branch\"), hypernetworks (since the parameter $\\boldsymbol{D}$ is generated by another layer), and data-dependent (since $\\boldsymbol{D}$ depends on the data $x$ ). However, this in fact simply defines a GLU function, which is so simple that it is often considered just an activation function (Dauphin et al. 2017; Shazeer 2020) instead of a meaningful layer. Selection. Thus, while selection mechanisms could be considered a special case of ideas such as architectural gating, hypernetworks, or data-dependence, so can an enormous range of other constructions-essentially anything with a multiplication, including standard attention mechanisms (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) as well-and we find it uninformative to think of them as such. Instead, we view it as most closely related to the gating mechanism of traditional RNNs, which is a special case (Theorem 1) and also has a deeper history of connections to SSMs through variable (input-dependent) discretization of $\\Delta$ (Funahashi and Nakamura 1993; Gu, Dao, et al. 2020; Tallec and Ollivier 2018). We also eschew the term \"gating\" in favor of selection to clarify the overloaded use of former. More narrowly, we use selection to refer to the mechanistic action of a model to select or ignore inputs and facilitate data interaction along the sequence length (Section 3.1). Beyond selective SSMs and gated RNNs, other examples may include input-dependent convolutions (Kosma, Nikolentzos, and Vazirgiannis 2023; Lioutas and Guo 2020; Lutati, Zimerman, and Wolf 2023; Yang et al. 2019) and even attention. ## B Related Work\n\nWe overview several prior works related to our methods. We mention that some of the most closely related models include recurrent layers such as S4, S5, and quasi-RNNs; as well as end-to-end architectures such as H3, RetNet, and RWKV. ## B. 1 S4 Variants and Derivatives\n\nWe describe a brief overview of some structured SSMs from past work, particularly those that have a relation to our method. - S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) introduced the first structured SSM, describing diagonal structure and diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR). It focused on efficient convolutional algorithms for DPLR SSMs due to a connection to continuous-time online memorization (HIPPO) (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). - DSS (Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022) first discovered the empirical effectiveness of diagonal structured SSMs by approximating the HIPPO initialization. This was expanded on theoretically in S4D (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022). - S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) independently discovered the diagonal SSM approximation, and is the first S4 model to be computed recurrently with the parallel scan. However, this required lowering the effective state dimension, which they accomplished by switching the SSM dimensions from a SISO (single-input single-output) to MIMO (multi-input multi-output) formulation. Our proposed S6 shares the scan, but differs by (i) keeping the SISO dimensions, which provides a larger effective recurrent state, (ii) using a hardware-aware algorithm to overcome the computation issue, (iii) adding the selection mechanism. Lu et al. (2023) applied S5 to meta-RL in order to handle resetting the SSM state between episode trajectories. Their mechanism can be viewed as a particular hard-coded instance of a selection mechanism, where $\\bar{A}$ is manually set to 0 , instead of our learnable mechanism that depends on the input. It would be interesting to apply selective SSMs generically to this setting and probe if the model has learned to automatically reset its state on episode boundaries. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) introduced a simplification of S4 to be real- instead of complex- valued, giving it an interpretation of being an exponential moving average (EMA). They additionally make an interesting connection of the discretization step of SSMs to an EMA damping term. Contrary to findings in the original S4 papers, this was the first model to show that real-valued SSMs are empirically effective in certain settings or when combined with different architectural components. - Liquid S4 (Hasani et al. 2023) is also motivated by augmenting S4 with an input-dependent state transition. From this perspective it shares similarity to selection mechanisms, although in a limited form which is still computed convolutionally and close to LTI. - SGConv (Y. Li et al. 2023), Hyena (Poli et al. 2023), LongConv (Fu et al. 2023), MultiresConv (J. Shi, K. A. Wang, and Fox 2023), and Toeplitz Neural Network (Qin, Han, W. Sun, B. He, et al. 2023) all focus on the convolutional representation of S4 and create global or long convolution kernels with different parameterizations. However, these methods cannot do fast autoregressive inference directly. Notably, all of these methods, and all other structured SSMs that we are aware of, have been non-selective and usually strictly LTI (linear time invariant). ## B. 2 SSM Architectures\n\nWe use SSM architectures or state space neural networks (SSNN) to refer to deep neural network architectures incorporating one of the previous SSMs as a black box layer. - GSS (Mehta et al. 2023) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs. It is motivated by the gated attention unit (GAU) of Hua et al. (2022) and looks quite similar to our block, except with additional projections. Most importantly, its projection contracts the model dimension to reduce the state size of the SSM, while ours expands the model dimension in order to increase the state size, based on the motivation in Section 3.1. - Mega (Ma et al. 2023) combined the EMA simplification of S4 described above into a hybrid architecture using an efficient attention approximation. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) is motivated by combining S4 with linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). It is the first to generalize this formulation of linear attention to more general recurrences, which is also the basis of later architectures. - Selective S4 (J. Wang et al. 2023) incorporates S4 as a black box to generate a binary mask which is multiplied on the input. While sharing the \"selection\" name, we consider this an architectural modification that is closer to architectural gating than a selection mechanism (Appendix A). For example, we hypothesize that it would not solve the Selective\n\nCopying task because simply masking out the irrelevant inputs does not affect the spacing between the relevant ones (indeed, the Selective Copying task can even be viewed as coming pre-masked if the noise tokens are embedded to 0 ).\n```\n\n#### 2. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 4. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Despite their empirical success, there is a lack of theoretical explorations such as generalization properties. In this paper, we take a first step towards establishing a generalization guarantee for GCN-based recommendation models under inductive and transductive learning. We mainly investigate the roles of graph normalization and non-linear activation, providing some theoretical understanding, and construct extensive experiments to further verify these findings empirically. Furthermore, based on the proven generalization bound and the challenge of existing models in discrete data learning, we propose Item Mixture (IMix) to enhance recommendation. It models discrete spaces in a continuous manner by mixing the embeddings of positive-negative item pairs, and its effectiveness can be strictly guaranteed from empirical and theoretical aspects.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Our analysis reveals that the present models often violate AMR structural constraints. To address this issue, we develop a validation method, and show how ensemble models can exploit SMATCH metric weaknesses to obtain higher scores, but sometimes result in corrupted graphs. Additionally, we highlight the demanding need to compute the SMATCH score among all possible predictions.

A Semi-Autoregressive Graph Generative Model for Dependency Graph Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: \"Graph convolution enhancements for autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Ye Ma, Mingming Sun, P. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Semi-Autoregressive Dependency Parser to generate dependency graphs via adding node groups and edge groups autoregressively while pouring out all group elements in parallel, and outperforms strong baselines on Enhanced Universal Dependencies of multiple languages, especially achieving $4\\%$ average promotion at graph-level accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed the impressive progress in Neural Dependency Parsing. According to the different factorization approaches to the graph joint probabilities, existing parsers can be roughly divided into autoregressive and non-autoregressive patterns. The former means that the graph should be factorized into multiple sequentially dependent components, then it can be built up component by component. And the latter assumes these components to be independent so that they can be outputted in a one-shot manner. However, when treating the directed edge as an explicit dependency relationship, we discover that there is a mixture of independent and interdependent components in the dependency graph, signifying that both aforementioned models fail to precisely capture the explicit dependencies among nodes and edges. Based on this property, we design a Semi-Autoregressive Dependency Parser to generate dependency graphs via adding node groups and edge groups autoregressively while pouring out all group elements in parallel. The model gains a trade-off between non-autoregression and autoregression, which respectively suffer from the lack of target inter-dependencies and the uncertainty of graph generation orders. The experiments show the proposed parser outperforms strong baselines on Enhanced Universal Dependencies of multiple languages, especially achieving $4\\%$ average promotion at graph-level accuracy. Also, the performances of model variations show the importance of specific parts.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Dynamic gating mechanisms in GAUs\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Inspired by recent advances in powerful large language models, we adopt a sequence-based approach to autoregressively generate triangle meshes as sequences of triangles. We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings, using graph convolutions, which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology. These embeddings are sequenced and decoded into triangles by a decoder, ensuring that they can effectively reconstruct the mesh. A transformer is then trained on this learned vocabulary to predict the index of the next embedding given previous embeddings. Once trained, our model can be autoregressively sampled to generate new triangle meshes, directly generating compact meshes with sharp edges, more closely imitating the efficient triangulation patterns of human-crafted meshes. MeshGPT demonstrates a notable improvement over state of the art mesh generation methods, with a 9% increase in shape coverage and a 30-point enhancement in FID scores across various categories.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) that integrates advanced gating mechanisms, graph convolutional techniques, and efficient state integration to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of language models.

Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat. ## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advance on efficient sequence modeling with State Space Models (SSMs) [GGR21; GDE ${ }^{+}$20; GGGR22; GB22; SWL23] has shown impressive performance for a wide range of tasks across modalities, such as text classification, image recognition and speech recognition. SSMs, as firstorder linear models, defined by a set of input, output, and state variables connected by first-order differential equations, can efficiently capture the recurrent structure in sequential data with carefully designed state matrices and the application of convolutional parallelism [GGR21]. However, they still significantly underperform the self-attention [BCB14; $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17] based model in both language modeling and machine translation [VPSP23] tasks. A recent work [FDS ${ }^{+}$23] reveals that this is due to its deficiency of modeling the second-order pairwise comparisons between the input tokens, and shows that the augmentation of an additional shifted SSM layer can improve SSM's associative recalling\n\n[^0]ability. Furthermore, better quality-efficiency trade-off can be achieved by directly introducing extra self-attention modules to form a hybrid model (e.g. MEGA [MZK ${ }^{+}$23] and Hybrid H3 [FDS ${ }^{+}$23]) that utilizes both the first and the second order inductive biases, i.e., SSM and self-attention. However, the current hybrid models apply the attention modules statically and uniformly to each of the input token regardless the property of the task itself. This can lead to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs since not all input tokens require second-order modeling and this computation need can vary substantially depending on both its context and the task difficulty. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions for efficiently combining attention with SSMs:\n\n- RQ1: Can neural networks learn to activate their attention modules on demand to achieve better quality-efficiency trade-off? - RQ2: How much extra attention is needed for the SSMs on a task-by-task basis? To answer these questions, we develop a new general mechanism, Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), that allows a neural network to sparsely and dynamically activate its sub-modules for each of the input token in a fully differentiable manner. Specifically, we assume a neural model can be composed of multiple heterogeneous sub-modules. For the input sequence, a latent configurator sparsely maps tokens to multiple compressed sequences corresponding to sub-modules. Each sub-module is then only applied on its mapped shorter sequence. Compared with activating all sub-modules on the whole input, Sparse Modular Activation can reduce computation and memory consumption for both the training and inference stages. Notably, SMA is proved to have a full coverage of the combinatorial search space of module activation, which is further explained in Section 3.2. Efficient learning of dynamic sparsity is notoriously difficult under the constraint of the current parallel hardware [LQC ${ }^{+} 22$; GZYE20; XM22]. To enable the practical efficiency gains from our module-level sparsity, we provide a simple yet efficient parallel implementation of SMA without any custom fused GPU kernels. Specifically, when compressing a batch of sequences in SMA, our implementation conducts both token selection and the sequence re-padding simultaneously using a single scatter operation that is widely optimized and present in modern deep learning frameworks. To address RQ1, we apply SMA to construct a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, that sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) [HDLL22] based on the state representation learned from an SSM. Both the GAU and the SSM representations are then aggregated through simple addition and activation to form a layer-level representation. Multiple same-sized SeqBoat layers are stacked sequentially to form a full neural model. Inspired by the working memory mechanism [AS68] used in human cognition, we further restrict the GAU to only apply local attention on the compressed sequence, which allows our model to have linear sequence inference complexity but theoretically infinite attention span. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SeqBoat has significantly better qualityefficiency trade-off than state-of-the-art hybrid models on a wide range of tasks, including Long Range Arena (LRA) [TDA ${ }^{+}$20], speech classification [War18] and language modeling [Hut06]. On the competitive LRA benchmark, SeqBoat achieves 1.96 higher average accuracy than MEGA-chunk $\\left[\\mathrm{MZK}^{+} 23\\right]$, the previous best hybrid model, with a $10.4 \\times$ training speed up and a $95 \\%$ memory reduction compared to the Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17] on the Text task with 4,096 input length. Thanks to the intrinsic modular sparsity brought by SMA, SeqBoat directly reveals the amount of attention needed for each data sample of each task through its sparse activation patterns of GAU, addressing RQ2. We demonstrate that our working memory mechanism provides substantially better computation-accuracy trade-off than chunking based models, and analyze the relationship between the working memory size and the effective attention span on various long sequence modeling tasks. ## 2 Background\n\nTo motivate and clarify our proposed techniques, we first present a mathematical formulation of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism and show how it encompasses and generalizes previous attempts that aimed for module-level dynamic sparsity. A dedicated section for detailed comparisons between our approach with the related works is also included in Appendix F. We begin by reviewing how the standard sequence modeling is formalized to establish the common ground for our discussion. ### 2.1 Time-Invariant Sequence Modeling\n\nGiven a discrete sequence, $\\mathbf{x}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, consisting of $n$ tokens, a time-invariant sequence model $P_{\\theta}$ is optimized to maximize the likelihood of the observed sequences by factorizing them as follows:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{<t}, \\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t-1}\\right\\}$ is the sequence history at time step $t$, and the parameter $\\theta$ is independent of the time step $t$. This formulation implies that the full model parameters $\\theta$ and the full history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$ are both essential for the conditional prediction of each token $x_{t}$. However, one potential issue is as the prediction difficulty of each token may differ depending on the context and the position, this static model $P_{\\theta}$ can lead to sub-optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off by wasting computation on either unimportant context $\\left[\\mathrm{SJP}^{+} 21\\right]$ or easy-to-predict tokens [Gra16]. ## 3 Learning Sparse Modular Activation\n\nTo cover a larger search space that may contain more efficient sequence models, we propose to formulate sequence modeling as a problem of finding an optimal time-variant model that can dynamically activate a subset of modules from a pre-defined function space for each time step. ### 3.1 Time-Variant Sequence Modeling\n\nFormally, a time-variant sequence model is defined on a compact function space $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$, where $V$ is the size of the vocabulary and $\\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}: \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t} \\in \\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}$, contains all possible sub-sequences of the sequence history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$. Then for each of the token prediction at the time step $t$, the model learns to apply a function $f_{t} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with the parameters $\\theta_{t}$ that maximizes the sequence probability, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\max _{f_{t}, \\theta_{t}, \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}} P_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P_{f_{t}}\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}, \\theta_{t}\\right) \\quad \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t}\n$$\n\nThis formulation generalizes the previous works in pursuing a dynamic and sparse model for sequence modeling, where the connections are further explained in Appendix F. In this work, we assume the function space $\\mathcal{F}$ is chain-structured, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{H} \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{N} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{1} \\circ \\mathcal{E}$, where $\\mathcal{H}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$ is the classification function, $\\mathcal{E}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the embedding function, $N$ is the number of intermediate layers, $d_{m}$ is the model size and $\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the function space of the intermediate mappings. We further assume that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the spanning set of a finite number of the function $f_{i}^{l}$ with its parameters $\\theta_{i}^{l}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{f_{1}^{l}, \\ldots, f_{M}^{l}\\right\\}$, where $M$ is the number of pre-defined functions. These assumptions justify the design of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism, which is further explained in the following section. ### 3.2 Sparse Modular Activation\n\nSparse Modular Activation (SMA) introduces a latent configurator at each time step $t$ and each layer of a neural sequence model.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 3.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 4.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Recent attempts to remedy this sub-sample the graph that reduces compute but introduce additional variance and may offer suboptimal performance. This paper develops the IGLU method that caches intermediate computations at various GCN layers thus enabling lazy updates that significantly reduce the compute cost of descent. IGLU introduces bounded bias into the gradients but nevertheless converges to a first-order saddle point under standard assumptions such as objective smoothness. Benchmark experiments show that IGLU offers up to 1.2% better accuracy despite requiring up to 88% less compute.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

When data are sensitive, it is desirable to provide privacy guarantees for linear sketches to preserve private information while delivering useful results with theoretical bounds. We show that linear sketches can ensure privacy and maintain their unique properties with a small amount of noise added at initialization. From the differentially private linear sketches, we showcase that the state-of-the-art quantile sketch in the turnstile model can also be private and maintain high performance. Experiments further demonstrate that our proposed differentially private sketches are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to noise-free sketches with high utilization on synthetic and real datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Implementations*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 4. Have LLMs Advanced Enough? A Challenging Problem Solving Benchmark For Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Daman Arora, H. Singh, Mausam*\n\n**TL;DR:** JEEBench is presented, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs, and a post-hoc confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency is developed, which enables effective response selection.\n\n**Abstract:** The performance of large language models (LLMs) on existing reasoning benchmarks has significantly improved over the past years. In response, we present JEEBench, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs. We curate 515 challenging pre-engineering mathematics, physics and chemistry problems from the highly competitive IIT JEE-Advanced exam. Long-horizon reasoning on top of deep in-domain knowledge is essential for solving problems in this benchmark. Our evaluation on various open-source and proprietary models reveals that the highest performance, even after using techniques like self-consistency, self-refinement and chain-of-thought prompting, is less than 40%. The typical failure modes of GPT-4, the best model, are errors in algebraic manipulation, difficulty in grounding abstract concepts into mathematical equations accurately and failure in retrieving relevant domain-specific concepts. We also observe that by mere prompting, GPT-4 is unable to assess risk introduced by negative marking for incorrect answers. For this, we develop a post-hoc confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency, which enables effective response selection. We hope that our challenging benchmark will guide future re-search in problem-solving using LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. HIFA: High-fidelity Text-to-3D Generation with Advanced Diffusion Guidance\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Junzhe Zhu, Peiye Zhuang, Oluwasanmi Koyejo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization, and introduces a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse- to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions.\n\n**Abstract:** The advancements in automatic text-to-3D generation have been remarkable. Most existing methods use pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) via latent-space denoising score matching. Yet, these methods often result in artifacts and inconsistencies across different views due to their suboptimal optimization approaches and limited understanding of 3D geometry. Moreover, the inherent constraints of NeRFs in rendering crisp geometry and stable textures usually lead to a two-stage optimization to attain high-resolution details. This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization. We compute denoising scores in the text-to-image diffusion model's latent and image spaces. Instead of randomly sampling timesteps (also referred to as noise levels in denoising score matching), we introduce a novel timestep annealing approach that progressively reduces the sampled timestep throughout optimization. To generate high-quality renderings in a single-stage optimization, we propose regularization for the variance of z-coordinates along NeRF rays. To address texture flickering issues in NeRFs, we introduce a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse-to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches, enabling the generation of highly detailed and view-consistent 3D assets through a single-stage training process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Advanced Markov Logic Techniques for Scalable Joint Inference in NLP\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*D. Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate, Vincent Ng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This tutorial introduces the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user).\n\n**Abstract:** In the early days of the statistical NLP era, many language processing tasks were tackled using the so-called pipeline architecture: the given task is broken into a series of sub-tasks such that the output of one sub-task is an input to the next sub-task in the sequence. The pipeline architecture is appealing for various reasons, including modularity, modeling convenience, and manageable computational complexity. However, it suffers from the error propagation problem: errors made in one sub-task are propagated to the next sub-task in the sequence, leading to poor accuracy on that sub-task, which in turn leads to more errors downstream. Another disadvantage associated with it is lack of feedback: errors made in a sub-task are often not corrected using knowledge uncovered while solving another sub-task down the pipeline.Realizing these weaknesses, researchers have turned to joint inference approaches in recent years. One such approach involves the use of Markov logic, which is defined as a set of weighted first-order logic formulas and, at a high level, unifies first-order logic with probabilistic graphical models. It is an ideal modeling language (knowledge representation) for compactly representing relational and uncertain knowledge in NLP. In a typical use case of MLNs in NLP, the application designer describes the background knowledge using a few first-order logic sentences and then uses software packages such as Alchemy, Tuffy, and Markov the beast to perform learning and inference (prediction) over the MLN. However, despite its obvious advantages, over the years, researchers and practitioners have found it difficult to use MLNs effectively in many NLP applications. The main reason for this is that it is hard to scale inference and learning algorithms for MLNs to large datasets and complex models, that are typical in NLP.In this tutorial, we will introduce the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user). Specifically, we will introduce attendees to a key idea that has emerged in the MLN research community over the last few years, lifted inference , which refers to inference techniques that take advantage of symmetries (e.g., synonyms), both exact and approximate, in the MLN . We will describe how these next-generation inference techniques can be used to perform effective joint inference. We will also present our new software package for inference and learning in MLNs, Alchemy 2.0, which is based on lifted inference, focusing primarily on how it can be used to scale up inference and learning in large models and datasets for applications such as semantic similarity determination, information extraction and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Self-Instantiated Recurrent Units with Dynamic Soft Recursion\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Aston Zhang, Yi Tay, Yikang Shen, Alvin Chan, Shuai Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) is proposed with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Abstract:** While standard recurrent neural networks explicitly impose a chain structure on different forms of data, they do not have an explicit bias towards recursive self-instantiation where the extent of recursion is dynamic. Given diverse and even growing data modalities (e.g., logic, algorithmic input and output, music, code, images, and language) that can be expressed in sequences and may bene\ufb01t from more architectural \ufb02exibility, we propose the self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion. On one hand, the Self-IRU is characterized by recursive self-instantiation via its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of the Self-IRU are controlled by instances of the Self-IRU itself, which are repeatedly invoked in a recursive fashion. On the other hand, the extent of the Self-IRU recursion is controlled by gates whose values are between 0 and 1 and may vary across the temporal dimension of sequences, enabling dynamic soft recursion depth at each time step. The architectural \ufb02exibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach are demonstrated across multiple data modalities. For example, the Self-IRU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset [Bowman et al., 2014] even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Reliability-aware Dynamic Feature Composition for Name Tagging\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Ying Lin, Liyuan Liu, Heng Ji, Dong Yu, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel reliability-aware name tagging model that is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms and improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Abstract:** Word embeddings are widely used on a variety of tasks and can substantially improve the performance. However, their quality is not consistent throughout the vocabulary due to the long-tail distribution of word frequency. Without sufficient contexts, rare word embeddings are usually less reliable than those of common words. However, current models typically trust all word embeddings equally regardless of their reliability and thus may introduce noise and hurt the performance. Since names often contain rare and uncommon words, this problem is particularly critical for name tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel reliability-aware name tagging model to tackle this issue. We design a set of word frequency-based reliability signals to indicate the quality of each word embedding. Guided by the reliability signals, the model is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms. For example, if an input word is rare, the model relies less on its word embedding and assigns higher weights to its character and contextual features. Experiments on OntoNotes 5.0 show that our model outperforms the baseline model by 2.7% absolute gain in F-score. In cross-genre experiments on five genres in OntoNotes, our model improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Logiformer: A Two-Branch Graph Transformer Network for Interpretable\n  Logical Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Fangzhi Xu, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Yudai Pan, Lingling Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine reading comprehension has aroused wide concerns, since it explores\nthe potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine\nwith the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is\nproposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to\nextract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains\na challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.\nAlso, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further\nfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch\ngraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce\ndifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical\nunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The\nlogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the\nsyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.\nSecondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each\ngraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two\nadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer\nlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text\nembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware\nself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the\nfeatures. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the\nlogical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental\nresults show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-02T08:34:59Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-08T06:28:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Echotune: A Modular Extractor Leveraging the Variable-Length Nature of\n  Speech in ASR Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Sizhou Chen, Songyang Gao, Sen Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective for Automatic\nSpeech Recognition (ASR) tasks, becoming a foundational component for a\nplethora of research in the domain. Historically, many approaches have leaned\non fixed-length attention windows, which becomes problematic for varied speech\nsamples in duration and complexity, leading to data over-smoothing and neglect\nof essential long-term connectivity. Addressing this limitation, we introduce\nEcho-MSA, a nimble module equipped with a variable-length attention mechanism\nthat accommodates a range of speech sample complexities and durations. This\nmodule offers the flexibility to extract speech features across various\ngranularities, spanning from frames and phonemes to words and discourse. The\nproposed design captures the variable length feature of speech and addresses\nthe limitations of fixed-length attention. Our evaluation leverages a parallel\nattention architecture complemented by a dynamic gating mechanism that\namalgamates traditional attention with the Echo-MSA module output. Empirical\nevidence from our study reveals that integrating Echo-MSA into the primary\nmodel's training regime significantly enhances the word error rate (WER)\nperformance, all while preserving the intrinsic stability of the original\nmodel.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-14T14:51:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-08T03:30:34Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCN Implementations*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Wei-Lin Chiang, Yang Li, Si Si, Samy Bengio, Xuanqing Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

We also provide an original GCN-based skeleton action recognition model named ST-GCN++, which achieves competitive recognition performance without any complicated attention schemes, serving as a strong baseline. Meanwhile, PYSKL supports the training and testing of nine skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art recognition performance on eight of them. To facilitate future research on skeleton action recognition, we also provide a large number of trained models and detailed benchmark results to give some insights.

Mamba YOLO: SSMs-Based YOLO For Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Xinzhong Zhu, Huiying Xu, Chen Li, Zeyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Propelled by the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Researchers have continuously explored innovative applications of reparameterization, efficient layer aggregation networks, and anchor-free techniques on the foundation of YOLO. To further enhance detection performance, Transformer-based structures have been introduced, significantly expanding the model's receptive field and achieving notable performance gains. However, such improvements come at a cost, as the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. Fortunately, the emergence of State Space Models (SSM) as an innovative technology has effectively mitigated the issues caused by quadratic complexity. In light of these advancements, we introduce Mamba-YOLO a novel object detection model based on SSM. Mamba-YOLO not only optimizes the SSM foundation but also adapts specifically for object detection tasks. Given the potential limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive field and weak image locality, we have designed the LSBlock and RGBlock. These modules enable more precise capture of local image dependencies and significantly enhance the robustness of the model.

However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed \\emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Xin Lu, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Thomas Huang, Jimei Yang, Jiahui Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a generative image inpainting system to complete images with free-form mask and guidance. The system is based on gated convolutions learned from millions of images without additional labelling efforts. The proposed gated convolution solves the issue of vanilla convolution that treats all input pixels as valid ones, generalizes partial convolution by providing a learnable dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. Moreover, as free-form masks may appear anywhere in images with any shape, global and local GANs designed for a single rectangular mask are not applicable. Thus, we also present a patch-based GAN loss, named SN-PatchGAN, by applying spectral-normalized discriminator on dense image patches. SN-PatchGAN is simple in formulation, fast and stable in training. Results on automatic image inpainting and user-guided extension demonstrate that our system generates higher-quality and more flexible results than previous methods. Our system helps user quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks and edit faces. Code, demo and models are available at: https://github.com/JiahuiYu/generative_inpainting\n\n**Conference:** free-form-image-inpainting-with-gated-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient implementations of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), advanced State Space Models (SSMs) techniques, and dynamic gating mechanisms, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Efficient GCN Implementations\n\n### Pipelined Feature Communication\nThe \"PipeGCN\" approach is particularly relevant, as it introduces a method to enhance the scalability and efficiency of GCNs by pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. This technique can significantly reduce the communication overhead, making full-graph training of GCNs more efficient.\n\n### Sampling and Aggregation Techniques\nGraphSage, mentioned in another context, uses sampling techniques to learn the latent features of nodes efficiently. This involves uniformly selecting neighboring nodes from different edge distances, which reduces computational overhead compared to calculating the node feature vectors based on the entire neighborhood.\n\n### End-to-End Training with GNNs\nThe integration of GCNs with language models can be optimized through end-to-end training, which helps in leveraging the unique advantages of GNN message passing techniques. However, this requires addressing computation redundancy issues, such as encoding redundancy in LMs and propagation redundancy in GNNs. Techniques like neighbor decoupling and implicit graph modeling can help alleviate these issues.\n\n## Advanced SSM Techniques\n\n### Dense Hidden Connections\nThe \"DenseMamba\" approach enhances SSMs by introducing dense hidden connections, which improve the flow of hidden information between layers. This method retains fine-grained information crucial for output, making it a valuable technique for efficient state integration in language models[Analysis Note].\n\n### Convolutional State Space Models\nConvolutional State Space Models (ConvSSMs) combine tensor modeling with state space methods, providing a framework for modeling long-range dependencies. This can be particularly useful in language models where capturing long-range contextual information is essential[Analysis Note].\n\n## Dynamic Gating Mechanisms\n\n### Adaptive Gate Control\nDynamic gating mechanisms can optimize computational resources by controlling information flow based on input complexity. This can be achieved through adaptive gate control and sparse activation, similar to methods used in Graph Attention Networks (GATs). Such mechanisms can help in reducing unnecessary computations and improving model efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n### Contextual Gating\nIn the context of language models, dynamic gating can be integrated to adaptively control the flow of information based on the context. This can be inspired by models that use attention mechanisms to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, thereby optimizing computational resources.\n\n## Integration and Scalability\n\n### Combining GCNs and SSMs\nTo integrate GCNs and SSMs effectively, it is crucial to address the scalability and computational efficiency challenges. Techniques such as localized graph operations, attention-based methods, and efficient state tracking in SSMs can be combined to create a scalable and efficient autoregressive language model[Analysis Note].\n\n### End-to-End Training\nEnd-to-end training of GCNs and language models can be crucial for achieving data efficiency and computational scalability. This involves optimizing the training process to minimize redundancy and leverage the strengths of both GCNs and SSMs.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is not only efficient in terms of computation but also scalable, allowing for better performance with larger models and more data.\n",

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

Score: 0.83)\n\n*William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Analysis of state-space models reveals that SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill&Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the\"state\"in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/39 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv:2312.00752.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/56 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nY. N. Dauphin, A. Fan, M.

ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Simple and Deep Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutional Networks*\n\n*Ming Chen, Zhewei Wei, Zengfeng Huang, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** The GCNII is proposed, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\\em Initial residual} and {\\em Identity mapping} that effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach for graph-structured data. Recently, GCNs and subsequent variants have shown superior performance in various application areas on real-world datasets. Despite their success, most of the current GCN models are shallow, due to the {\\em over-smoothing} problem. In this paper, we study the problem of designing and analyzing deep graph convolutional networks. We propose the GCNII, an extension of the vanilla GCN model with two simple yet effective techniques: {\\em Initial residual} and {\\em Identity mapping}. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the two techniques effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing. Our experiments show that the deep GCNII model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various semi- and full-supervised tasks.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 216  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 6. Jointly-Learned Exit and Inference for a Dynamic Neural Network : JEI-DNN\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating*\n\n*Florence Regol, Joud Chataoui, Mark Coates*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel architecture that connects the gating mechanism and the intermediate inference modules of early-exiting dynamic neural networks, which leads to significant performance improvements on classification datasets and enables better uncertainty characterization capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained models, coupled with fine-tuning, are slowly becoming established as the dominant architecture in machine learning. Even though these models offer impressive performance, their practical application is often limited by the prohibitive amount of resources required for every inference. Early-exiting dynamic neural networks (EDNN) circumvent this issue by allowing a model to make some of its predictions from intermediate layers (i.e., early-exit). Training an EDNN architecture is challenging as it consists of two intertwined components: the gating mechanism (GM) that controls early-exiting decisions and the intermediate inference modules (IMs) that perform inference from intermediate representations. As a result, most existing approaches rely on thresholding confidence metrics for the gating mechanism and strive to improve the underlying backbone network and the inference modules. Although successful, this approach has two fundamental shortcomings: 1) the GMs and the IMs are decoupled during training, leading to a train-test mismatch; and 2) the thresholding gating mechanism introduces a positive bias into the predictive probabilities, making it difficult to readily extract uncertainty information. We propose a novel architecture that connects these two modules. This leads to significant performance improvements on classification datasets and enables better uncertainty characterization capabilities.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Channel Gating Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating*\n\n*Weizhe Hua, Christopher De Sa, Zhiru Zhang, G. Suh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An accelerator is designed for channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces channel gating, a dynamic, fine-grained, and hardware-efficient pruning scheme to reduce the computation cost for convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Channel gating identifies regions in the features that contribute less to the classification result, and skips the computation on a subset of the input channels for these ineffective regions. Unlike static network pruning, channel gating optimizes CNN inference at run-time by exploiting input-specific characteristics, which allows substantially reducing the compute cost with almost no accuracy loss. We experimentally show that applying channel gating in state-of-the-art networks achieves 2.7-8.0$\\times$ reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and 2.0-4.4$\\times$ reduction in off-chip memory accesses with a minimal accuracy loss on CIFAR-10. Combining our method with knowledge distillation reduces the compute cost of ResNet-18 by 2.6$\\times$ without accuracy drop on ImageNet. We further demonstrate that channel gating can be realized in hardware efficiently. Our approach exhibits sparsity patterns that are well-suited to dense systolic arrays with minimal additional hardware. We have designed an accelerator for channel gating networks, which can be implemented using either FPGAs or ASICs. Running a quantized ResNet-18 model for ImageNet, our accelerator achieves an encouraging speedup of 2.4$\\times$ on average, with a theoretical FLOP reduction of 2.8$\\times$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Learning Syntactic and Dynamic Selective Encoding for Document\n  Summarization\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating*\n\n*Haiyang Xu, Yahao He, Kun Han, Junwen Chen, Xiangang Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Text summarization aims to generate a headline or a short summary consisting\nof the major information of the source text. Recent studies employ the\nsequence-to-sequence framework to encode the input with a neural network and\ngenerate abstractive summary. However, most studies feed the encoder with the\nsemantic word embedding but ignore the syntactic information of the text.\nFurther, although previous studies proposed the selective gate to control the\ninformation flow from the encoder to the decoder, it is static during the\ndecoding and cannot differentiate the information based on the decoder states.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture for document\nsummarization. Our approach has the following contributions: first, we\nincorporate syntactic information such as constituency parsing trees into the\nencoding sequence to learn both the semantic and syntactic information from the\ndocument, resulting in more accurate summary; second, we propose a dynamic gate\nnetwork to select the salient information based on the context of the decoder\nstate, which is essential to document summarization.

Towards MoE Deployment: Mitigating Inefficiencies in Mixture-of-Expert\n  (MoE) Inference\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating*\n\n*Haiyang Huang, Newsha Ardalani, Anna Sun, Liu Ke, Hsien-Hsin S. Lee, Anjali Sridhar, Shruti Bhosale, Carole-Jean Wu, Benjamin Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have gained popularity in achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance in a wide range of tasks in computer vision and\nnatural language processing. They effectively expand the model capacity while\nincurring a minimal increase in computation cost during training.

In this work, we provide a characterization of\ntwo MoE workloads, namely Language Modeling (LM) and Machine Translation (MT)\nand identify their sources of inefficiencies at deployment.

Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutional Networks*\n\n*Amauri Holanda de Souza Jr., Kilian Q. Weinberger, Tianyi Zhang, Tao Yu, Felix Wu, Christopher Fifty*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and their variants have experienced significant attention and have become the de facto methods for learning graph representations. GCNs derive inspiration primarily from recent deep learning approaches, and as a result, may inherit unnecessary complexity and redundant computation. In this paper, we reduce this excess complexity through successively removing nonlinearities and collapsing weight matrices between consecutive layers. We theoretically analyze the resulting linear model and show that it corresponds to a fixed low-pass filter followed by a linear classifier. Notably, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that these simplifications do not negatively impact accuracy in many downstream applications. Moreover, the resulting model scales to larger datasets, is naturally interpretable, and yields up to two orders of magnitude speedup over FastGCN.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Graph Convolutional Networks*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Wei-Lin Chiang, Yang Li, Si Si, Samy Bengio, Xuanqing Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than 5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit). For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore, Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16].

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Dynamic Slate Recommendation with Gated Recurrent Units and Thompson Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating*\n\n*Arnoldo Frigessi, David S. Leslie, Simen Eide*\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of recommending relevant content to users of an internet platform in the form of lists of items, called slates. We introduce a variational Bayesian Recurrent Neural Net recommender system that acts on time series of interactions between the internet platform and the user, and which scales to real world industrial situations. The recommender system is tested both online on real users, and on an offline dataset collected from a Norwegian web-based marketplace, FINN.no, that is made public for research. This is one of the first publicly available datasets which includes all the slates that are presented to users as well as which items (if any) in the slates were clicked on. Such a data set allows us to move beyond the common assumption that implicitly assumes that users are considering all possible items at each interaction. Instead we build our likelihood using the items that are actually in the slate, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches theoretically and in experiments. We also introduce a hierarchical prior for the item parameters based on group memberships. Both item parameters and user preferences are learned probabilistically. Furthermore, we combine our model with bandit strategies to ensure learning, and introduce `in-slate Thompson Sampling' which makes use of the slates to maximise explorative opportunities. We show experimentally that explorative recommender strategies perform on par or above their greedy counterparts. Even without making use of exploration to learn more effectively, click rates increase simply because of improved diversity in the recommended slates.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating graph convolutional operations, state space models (SSMs), and dynamic gating mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Integration of Graph Convolutional Operations\n\n- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can be integrated into language models to capture global relational dependencies. This can be done by treating natural language sequences as graph-structured data, where tokens are nodes and their sequential relationships form edges. The Transformer can be seen as a special case of attention-based GNNs, where global self-attention replaces the need for explicit adjacency matrices.\n- For more complex graph structures, models like the Temporal Graph Attention Network (Temporal GAT) combine GCNs and Graph Attention Networks (GATs) to capture both structural and temporal dynamics. This approach can be adapted to language models to enhance their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n## Enhancement with State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- State Space Models can be used to manage and update intermediate state variables efficiently. In the context of sequence modeling, SSMs can help in capturing temporal dependencies and maintaining a consistent state across the sequence. However, there is limited direct literature on integrating SSMs into language models. Instead, researchers can draw inspiration from how SSMs are used in other domains, such as traffic flow forecasting, where adaptive graph convolutional modules and temporal attention layers are used to capture complex spatial-temporal dependencies.\n- The concept of using SSMs in language models might involve designing a system where the state variables are updated based on the input sequence, similar to how recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks operate, but with the added structure of SSMs.\n\n## Optimized Dynamic Gating Mechanisms\n\n- Dynamic gating mechanisms can be optimized using adaptive gate control and sparse activation. This is similar to the gating mechanisms used in RNNs and LSTMs, but with the added complexity of graph-structured data. The use of attention mechanisms, as seen in Graph Attention Networks (GATs), can help in assigning varying importance to different nodes (or tokens) in the graph, optimizing the computational resources.\n- The integration of dynamic gating can also be inspired by models that use local-global temporal attention, where the importance of different temporal patterns is automatically captured and promoted at different time levels.\n\n## Computational Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- To ensure computational efficiency, the integration of graph convolutions and SSMs must be done with careful consideration of the computational overhead. This can involve optimizing the architecture to use efficient memory access patterns and streamlined computations. For example, using positional embeddings in Transformers to handle sequential relationships can be more efficient than explicit adjacency matrices.\n- Scalability can be enhanced by designing the model to handle longer sequences and larger datasets efficiently. This might involve using techniques such as layer-wise propagation rules in GCNs and adaptive graph convolutional modules to capture complex dependencies without significant computational overhead.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Work\n\n- The proposal to integrate graph convolutional operations, SSMs, and dynamic gating mechanisms into autoregressive language models appears novel. However, it is essential to compare this with existing research on GAUs, graph convolutions, and SSMs. For instance, models like the TEA-GCN, which combines graph convolutional networks with Transformer architectures to capture spatial-temporal dependencies, can provide insights into how such integrations can be done efficiently.\n- Reviewing related works on generative pretrained foundation models, such as GPT, which use autoregressive techniques and attention mechanisms, can also provide valuable insights into how to design scalable and efficient language models.\n\nBy combining these elements, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of graph convolutional operations, state space models, and dynamic gating mechanisms, leading to improved performance in terms of scalability, efficiency, and robustness.\n",

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Lane*\n\n**TL;DR:** BRP-NAS is proposed, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN) that outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS- Bench-201 and DARTS.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) enables researchers to automatically explore broad design spaces in order to improve efficiency of neural networks. This efficiency is especially important in the case of on-device deployment, where improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data selection strategy. We show that our proposed method outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. Finally, to raise awareness of the fact that accurate latency estimation is not a trivial task, we release LatBench -- a latency dataset of NAS-Bench-201 models running on a broad range of devices.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 183  (*Influential: 35*)\n\n#### 2. PipeGCN: Efficient Full-Graph Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Pipelined Feature Communication\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Cheng Wan, Youjie Li, Cameron R. Wolfe, Anastasios Kyrillidis, Namjae Kim, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness, and develops a smoothing method to further improve Pipe GCN's convergence.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is the state-of-the-art method for learning graph-structured data, and training large-scale GCNs requires distributed training across multiple accelerators such that each accelerator is able to hold a partitioned subgraph. However, distributed GCN training incurs prohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among partitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the achievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose PipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It is non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node features/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence, negating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the convergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature gradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a smoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive experiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput (1.7x~28.5x) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and existing full-graph training methods.

A typical GCN layer consists of a linear feature propagation step and a nonlinear transformation step. Recent works show that a linear GCN can achieve comparable performance to the original non-linear GCN while being much more computationally efficient. In this paper, we dissect the feature propagation steps of linear GCNs from a perspective of continuous graph diffusion, and analyze why linear GCNs fail to benefit from more propagation steps. Following that, we propose Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) that decouples the terminal time and the feature propagation steps, making it more flexible and capable of exploiting a very large number of feature propagation steps. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DGC improves linear GCNs by a large margin and makes them competitive with many modern variants of non-linear GCNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. Have LLMs Advanced Enough? A Challenging Problem Solving Benchmark For Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Daman Arora, H. Singh, Mausam*\n\n**TL;DR:** JEEBench is presented, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs, and a post-hoc confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency is developed, which enables effective response selection.\n\n**Abstract:** The performance of large language models (LLMs) on existing reasoning benchmarks has significantly improved over the past years. In response, we present JEEBench, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs. We curate 515 challenging pre-engineering mathematics, physics and chemistry problems from the highly competitive IIT JEE-Advanced exam. Long-horizon reasoning on top of deep in-domain knowledge is essential for solving problems in this benchmark. Our evaluation on various open-source and proprietary models reveals that the highest performance, even after using techniques like self-consistency, self-refinement and chain-of-thought prompting, is less than 40%. The typical failure modes of GPT-4, the best model, are errors in algebraic manipulation, difficulty in grounding abstract concepts into mathematical equations accurately and failure in retrieving relevant domain-specific concepts. We also observe that by mere prompting, GPT-4 is unable to assess risk introduced by negative marking for incorrect answers. For this, we develop a post-hoc confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency, which enables effective response selection. We hope that our challenging benchmark will guide future re-search in problem-solving using LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. HIFA: High-fidelity Text-to-3D Generation with Advanced Diffusion Guidance\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Junzhe Zhu, Peiye Zhuang, Oluwasanmi Koyejo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization, and introduces a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse- to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions.\n\n**Abstract:** The advancements in automatic text-to-3D generation have been remarkable. Most existing methods use pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) via latent-space denoising score matching. Yet, these methods often result in artifacts and inconsistencies across different views due to their suboptimal optimization approaches and limited understanding of 3D geometry. Moreover, the inherent constraints of NeRFs in rendering crisp geometry and stable textures usually lead to a two-stage optimization to attain high-resolution details. This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization. We compute denoising scores in the text-to-image diffusion model's latent and image spaces. Instead of randomly sampling timesteps (also referred to as noise levels in denoising score matching), we introduce a novel timestep annealing approach that progressively reduces the sampled timestep throughout optimization. To generate high-quality renderings in a single-stage optimization, we propose regularization for the variance of z-coordinates along NeRF rays. To address texture flickering issues in NeRFs, we introduce a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse-to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches, enabling the generation of highly detailed and view-consistent 3D assets through a single-stage training process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Advanced Markov Logic Techniques for Scalable Joint Inference in NLP\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*D. Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate, Vincent Ng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This tutorial introduces the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user).\n\n**Abstract:** In the early days of the statistical NLP era, many language processing tasks were tackled using the so-called pipeline architecture: the given task is broken into a series of sub-tasks such that the output of one sub-task is an input to the next sub-task in the sequence. The pipeline architecture is appealing for various reasons, including modularity, modeling convenience, and manageable computational complexity. However, it suffers from the error propagation problem: errors made in one sub-task are propagated to the next sub-task in the sequence, leading to poor accuracy on that sub-task, which in turn leads to more errors downstream. Another disadvantage associated with it is lack of feedback: errors made in a sub-task are often not corrected using knowledge uncovered while solving another sub-task down the pipeline.Realizing these weaknesses, researchers have turned to joint inference approaches in recent years. One such approach involves the use of Markov logic, which is defined as a set of weighted first-order logic formulas and, at a high level, unifies first-order logic with probabilistic graphical models. It is an ideal modeling language (knowledge representation) for compactly representing relational and uncertain knowledge in NLP. In a typical use case of MLNs in NLP, the application designer describes the background knowledge using a few first-order logic sentences and then uses software packages such as Alchemy, Tuffy, and Markov the beast to perform learning and inference (prediction) over the MLN. However, despite its obvious advantages, over the years, researchers and practitioners have found it difficult to use MLNs effectively in many NLP applications. The main reason for this is that it is hard to scale inference and learning algorithms for MLNs to large datasets and complex models, that are typical in NLP.In this tutorial, we will introduce the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user). Specifically, we will introduce attendees to a key idea that has emerged in the MLN research community over the last few years, lifted inference , which refers to inference techniques that take advantage of symmetries (e.g., synonyms), both exact and approximate, in the MLN . We will describe how these next-generation inference techniques can be used to perform effective joint inference. We will also present our new software package for inference and learning in MLNs, Alchemy 2.0, which is based on lifted inference, focusing primarily on how it can be used to scale up inference and learning in large models and datasets for applications such as semantic similarity determination, information extraction and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Self-Instantiated Recurrent Units with Dynamic Soft Recursion\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Aston Zhang, Yi Tay, Yikang Shen, Alvin Chan, Shuai Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) is proposed with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Abstract:** While standard recurrent neural networks explicitly impose a chain structure on different forms of data, they do not have an explicit bias towards recursive self-instantiation where the extent of recursion is dynamic. Given diverse and even growing data modalities (e.g., logic, algorithmic input and output, music, code, images, and language) that can be expressed in sequences and may bene\ufb01t from more architectural \ufb02exibility, we propose the self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion. On one hand, the Self-IRU is characterized by recursive self-instantiation via its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of the Self-IRU are controlled by instances of the Self-IRU itself, which are repeatedly invoked in a recursive fashion. On the other hand, the extent of the Self-IRU recursion is controlled by gates whose values are between 0 and 1 and may vary across the temporal dimension of sequences, enabling dynamic soft recursion depth at each time step. The architectural \ufb02exibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach are demonstrated across multiple data modalities. For example, the Self-IRU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset [Bowman et al., 2014] even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Reliability-aware Dynamic Feature Composition for Name Tagging\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Ying Lin, Liyuan Liu, Heng Ji, Dong Yu, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel reliability-aware name tagging model that is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms and improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Abstract:** Word embeddings are widely used on a variety of tasks and can substantially improve the performance. However, their quality is not consistent throughout the vocabulary due to the long-tail distribution of word frequency. Without sufficient contexts, rare word embeddings are usually less reliable than those of common words. However, current models typically trust all word embeddings equally regardless of their reliability and thus may introduce noise and hurt the performance. Since names often contain rare and uncommon words, this problem is particularly critical for name tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel reliability-aware name tagging model to tackle this issue. We design a set of word frequency-based reliability signals to indicate the quality of each word embedding. Guided by the reliability signals, the model is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms. For example, if an input word is rare, the model relies less on its word embedding and assigns higher weights to its character and contextual features. Experiments on OntoNotes 5.0 show that our model outperforms the baseline model by 2.7% absolute gain in F-score. In cross-genre experiments on five genres in OntoNotes, our model improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Logiformer: A Two-Branch Graph Transformer Network for Interpretable\n  Logical Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Fangzhi Xu, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Yudai Pan, Lingling Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine reading comprehension has aroused wide concerns, since it explores\nthe potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine\nwith the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is\nproposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to\nextract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains\na challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.\nAlso, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further\nfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch\ngraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce\ndifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical\nunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The\nlogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the\nsyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.\nSecondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each\ngraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two\nadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer\nlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text\nembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware\nself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the\nfeatures. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the\nlogical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental\nresults show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-02T08:34:59Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-08T06:28:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Echotune: A Modular Extractor Leveraging the Variable-Length Nature of\n  Speech in ASR Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Sizhou Chen, Songyang Gao, Sen Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective for Automatic\nSpeech Recognition (ASR) tasks, becoming a foundational component for a\nplethora of research in the domain. Historically, many approaches have leaned\non fixed-length attention windows, which becomes problematic for varied speech\nsamples in duration and complexity, leading to data over-smoothing and neglect\nof essential long-term connectivity. Addressing this limitation, we introduce\nEcho-MSA, a nimble module equipped with a variable-length attention mechanism\nthat accommodates a range of speech sample complexities and durations. This\nmodule offers the flexibility to extract speech features across various\ngranularities, spanning from frames and phonemes to words and discourse. The\nproposed design captures the variable length feature of speech and addresses\nthe limitations of fixed-length attention. Our evaluation leverages a parallel\nattention architecture complemented by a dynamic gating mechanism that\namalgamates traditional attention with the Echo-MSA module output. Empirical\nevidence from our study reveals that integrating Echo-MSA into the primary\nmodel's training regime significantly enhances the word error rate (WER)\nperformance, all while preserving the intrinsic stability of the original\nmodel.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-14T14:51:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-08T03:30:34Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. IGLU: Efficient GCN Training via Lazy Updates\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Sundararajan Sellamanickam, Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain, Aditya Sinha, S Deepak Narayanan*\n\n**Abstract:** Training multi-layer Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) using standard SGD techniques scales poorly as each descent step ends up updating node embeddings for a large portion of the graph. Recent attempts to remedy this sub-sample the graph that reduces compute but introduce additional variance and may offer suboptimal performance. This paper develops the IGLU method that caches intermediate computations at various GCN layers thus enabling lazy updates that significantly reduce the compute cost of descent. IGLU introduces bounded bias into the gradients but nevertheless converges to a first-order saddle point under standard assumptions such as objective smoothness. Benchmark experiments show that IGLU offers up to 1.2% better accuracy despite requiring up to 88% less compute.\n\n**Conference:** iglu-efficient-gcn-training-via-lazy-updates-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Ajitesh Srivastava, Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful models for learning representations of attributed graphs. To scale GCNs to large graphs, state-of-the-art methods use various layer sampling techniques to alleviate the \"neighbor explosion\" problem during minibatch training. We propose GraphSAINT, a graph sampling based inductive learning method that improves training efficiency and accuracy in a fundamentally different way. By changing perspective, GraphSAINT constructs minibatches by sampling the training graph, rather than the nodes or edges across GCN layers. Each iteration, a complete GCN is built from the properly sampled subgraph. Thus, we ensure fixed number of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction. Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation, and extend GraphSAINT with many architecture variants (e.g., graph attention, jumping connection). GraphSAINT demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and training time on five large graphs, and achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores for PPI (0.995) and Reddit (0.970).\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Mamba YOLO: SSMs-Based YOLO For Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Xinzhong Zhu, Huiying Xu, Chen Li, Zeyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Propelled by the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Researchers have continuously explored innovative applications of reparameterization, efficient layer aggregation networks, and anchor-free techniques on the foundation of YOLO. To further enhance detection performance, Transformer-based structures have been introduced, significantly expanding the model's receptive field and achieving notable performance gains. However, such improvements come at a cost, as the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. Fortunately, the emergence of State Space Models (SSM) as an innovative technology has effectively mitigated the issues caused by quadratic complexity. In light of these advancements, we introduce Mamba-YOLO a novel object detection model based on SSM. Mamba-YOLO not only optimizes the SSM foundation but also adapts specifically for object detection tasks. Given the potential limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive field and weak image locality, we have designed the LSBlock and RGBlock. These modules enable more precise capture of local image dependencies and significantly enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results on the publicly available benchmark datasets COCO and VOC demonstrate that Mamba-YOLO surpasses the existing YOLO series models in both performance and competitiveness, showcasing its substantial potential and competitive edge.The PyTorch code is available at:\\url{https://github.com/HZAI-ZJNU/Mamba-YOLO}\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 5. RobustScanner: Dynamically Enhancing Positional Clues for Robust Text Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Hongbin Sun, Chenhao Lin, Wayne Zhang, Zhanghui Kuang, Xiaoyu Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention-based encoder-decoder framework has recently achieved impressive results for scene text recognition, and many variants have emerged with improvements in recognition quality. However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed \\emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Xin Lu, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Thomas Huang, Jimei Yang, Jiahui Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a generative image inpainting system to complete images with free-form mask and guidance. The system is based on gated convolutions learned from millions of images without additional labelling efforts. The proposed gated convolution solves the issue of vanilla convolution that treats all input pixels as valid ones, generalizes partial convolution by providing a learnable dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. Moreover, as free-form masks may appear anywhere in images with any shape, global and local GANs designed for a single rectangular mask are not applicable. Thus, we also present a patch-based GAN loss, named SN-PatchGAN, by applying spectral-normalized discriminator on dense image patches. SN-PatchGAN is simple in formulation, fast and stable in training. Results on automatic image inpainting and user-guided extension demonstrate that our system generates higher-quality and more flexible results than previous methods. Our system helps user quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks and edit faces.

To address this, techniques such as localized graph operations or attention-based methods can be employed. For instance, using adaptive attention mechanisms, as mentioned in the context of graph transformers, can help in managing computational complexity.\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Combining GCNs with other architectures, like transformers, can leverage the strengths of both. This approach allows GCNs to capture local structural properties while transformers handle long-range dependencies. Such hybrid models can be more efficient and scalable for node-level tasks.\n\n## Advanced SSM Techniques\n\n- **Convolutional State Space Models**: Integrating convolutional techniques into SSMs can enhance their ability to model long-range dependencies. Convolutional state space models (ConvSSMs) combine tensor modeling with state space methods, providing a framework for effective parameterization and initialization. This can be particularly useful for capturing complex dependencies in language models[Analysis Note, 3].\n\n- **Dense Connections**: Enhancing SSMs with dense hidden connections, as in DenseMamba, can improve the flow of hidden information between layers. This approach retains fine-grained information crucial for output, addressing some of the limitations in expressive power of traditional SSMs[Analysis Note, 4].\n\n## Dynamic Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Adaptive Gate Control**: Dynamic gating mechanisms can optimize computational resources by controlling information flow based on input complexity. Techniques like adaptive gate control and sparse activation, inspired by models such as Graph Attention Networks (GATs), can be integrated to make the model more efficient and scalable[Analysis Note, 3].\n\n- **Efficient Information Flow**: Implementing dynamic gating can help in selectively passing information through the network, reducing unnecessary computations and improving overall efficiency. This is particularly important in autoregressive models where sequential processing can be computationally intensive.\n\n## Integration and Scalability\n\n- **Neural Additive Tensor Decomposition (NeAT)**: While not directly related to GCNs or SSMs, NeAT's approach to applying neural networks to each latent component in an additive fashion can provide insights into how to capture diverse patterns and complex structures efficiently. This method could be adapted to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of integrated GCN and SSM models.\n\n- **Geometric Graph Networks**: The use of geometric graph networks (GGNs) to capture fine atomic-level geometric structural features can inspire similar approaches in language models. Techniques like geometric vector perceptrons and graph attention pooling can be adapted to improve the capture of complex dependencies and enhance model interpretability.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Exploring Novel Architectures**: Investigating novel GNN architectures and their combination with emerging techniques, such as reinforcement learning or meta-learning, can provide new avenues for improving scalability and efficiency. This includes exploring adaptive attention mechanisms, domain adaptation, and meta-learning techniques to enhance generalization and robustness.\n\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Methods like Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in the spectral domain, as seen in point cloud models, can be a promising approach for reducing training costs and improving efficiency in language models. This involves freezing pre-trained models and introducing lightweight, trainable adapters to fine-tune parameters efficiently.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of GCNs, advanced SSM techniques, and dynamic gating mechanisms. This approach can help in capturing both local and global dependencies effectively while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Lane*\n\n**TL;DR:** BRP-NAS is proposed, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN) that outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS- Bench-201 and DARTS.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural architecture search (NAS) enables researchers to automatically explore broad design spaces in order to improve efficiency of neural networks. This efficiency is especially important in the case of on-device deployment, where improvements in accuracy should be balanced out with computational demands of a model. In practice, performance metrics of model are computationally expensive to obtain. Previous work uses a proxy (e.g., number of operations) or a layer-wise measurement of neural network layers to estimate end-to-end hardware performance but the imprecise prediction diminishes the quality of NAS. To address this problem, we propose BRP-NAS, an efficient hardware-aware NAS enabled by an accurate performance predictor-based on graph convolutional network (GCN). What is more, we investigate prediction quality on different metrics and show that sample efficiency of the predictor-based NAS can be improved by considering binary relations of models and an iterative data selection strategy. We show that our proposed method outperforms all prior methods on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and DARTS. Finally, to raise awareness of the fact that accurate latency estimation is not a trivial task, we release LatBench -- a latency dataset of NAS-Bench-201 models running on a broad range of devices.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 183  (*Influential: 35*)\n\n#### 2. PipeGCN: Efficient Full-Graph Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Pipelined Feature Communication\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Cheng Wan, Youjie Li, Cameron R. Wolfe, Anastasios Kyrillidis, Namjae Kim, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness, and develops a smoothing method to further improve Pipe GCN's convergence.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is the state-of-the-art method for learning graph-structured data, and training large-scale GCNs requires distributed training across multiple accelerators such that each accelerator is able to hold a partitioned subgraph. However, distributed GCN training incurs prohibitive overhead of communicating node features and feature gradients among partitions for every GCN layer during each training iteration, limiting the achievable training efficiency and model scalability. To this end, we propose PipeGCN, a simple yet effective scheme that hides the communication overhead by pipelining inter-partition communication with intra-partition computation. It is non-trivial to pipeline for efficient GCN training, as communicated node features/gradients will become stale and thus can harm the convergence, negating the pipeline benefit. Notably, little is known regarding the convergence rate of GCN training with both stale features and stale feature gradients. This work not only provides a theoretical convergence analysis but also finds the convergence rate of PipeGCN to be close to that of the vanilla distributed GCN training without any staleness. Furthermore, we develop a smoothing method to further improve PipeGCN's convergence. Extensive experiments show that PipeGCN can largely boost the training throughput (1.7x~28.5x) while achieving the same accuracy as its vanilla counterpart and existing full-graph training methods.

A typical GCN layer consists of a linear feature propagation step and a nonlinear transformation step. Recent works show that a linear GCN can achieve comparable performance to the original non-linear GCN while being much more computationally efficient. In this paper, we dissect the feature propagation steps of linear GCNs from a perspective of continuous graph diffusion, and analyze why linear GCNs fail to benefit from more propagation steps. Following that, we propose Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) that decouples the terminal time and the feature propagation steps, making it more flexible and capable of exploiting a very large number of feature propagation steps. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DGC improves linear GCNs by a large margin and makes them competitive with many modern variants of non-linear GCNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4.

In response, we present JEEBench, a considerably more challenging benchmark dataset for evaluating the problem solving abilities of LLMs. We curate 515 challenging pre-engineering mathematics, physics and chemistry problems from the highly competitive IIT JEE-Advanced exam. Long-horizon reasoning on top of deep in-domain knowledge is essential for solving problems in this benchmark. Our evaluation on various open-source and proprietary models reveals that the highest performance, even after using techniques like self-consistency, self-refinement and chain-of-thought prompting, is less than 40%. The typical failure modes of GPT-4, the best model, are errors in algebraic manipulation, difficulty in grounding abstract concepts into mathematical equations accurately and failure in retrieving relevant domain-specific concepts. We also observe that by mere prompting, GPT-4 is unable to assess risk introduced by negative marking for incorrect answers. For this, we develop a post-hoc confidence-thresholding method over self-consistency, which enables effective response selection. We hope that our challenging benchmark will guide future re-search in problem-solving using LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. HIFA: High-fidelity Text-to-3D Generation with Advanced Diffusion Guidance\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Junzhe Zhu, Peiye Zhuang, Oluwasanmi Koyejo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization, and introduces a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse- to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions.\n\n**Abstract:** The advancements in automatic text-to-3D generation have been remarkable. Most existing methods use pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to optimize 3D representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) via latent-space denoising score matching. Yet, these methods often result in artifacts and inconsistencies across different views due to their suboptimal optimization approaches and limited understanding of 3D geometry. Moreover, the inherent constraints of NeRFs in rendering crisp geometry and stable textures usually lead to a two-stage optimization to attain high-resolution details. This work proposes holistic sampling and smoothing approaches to achieve high-quality text-to-3D generation, all in a single-stage optimization. We compute denoising scores in the text-to-image diffusion model's latent and image spaces. Instead of randomly sampling timesteps (also referred to as noise levels in denoising score matching), we introduce a novel timestep annealing approach that progressively reduces the sampled timestep throughout optimization. To generate high-quality renderings in a single-stage optimization, we propose regularization for the variance of z-coordinates along NeRF rays. To address texture flickering issues in NeRFs, we introduce a kernel smoothing technique that refines importance sampling weights coarse-to-fine, ensuring accurate and thorough sampling in high-density regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches, enabling the generation of highly detailed and view-consistent 3D assets through a single-stage training process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Advanced Markov Logic Techniques for Scalable Joint Inference in NLP\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*D. Venugopal, Vibhav Gogate, Vincent Ng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This tutorial introduces the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user).\n\n**Abstract:** In the early days of the statistical NLP era, many language processing tasks were tackled using the so-called pipeline architecture: the given task is broken into a series of sub-tasks such that the output of one sub-task is an input to the next sub-task in the sequence. The pipeline architecture is appealing for various reasons, including modularity, modeling convenience, and manageable computational complexity. However, it suffers from the error propagation problem: errors made in one sub-task are propagated to the next sub-task in the sequence, leading to poor accuracy on that sub-task, which in turn leads to more errors downstream. Another disadvantage associated with it is lack of feedback: errors made in a sub-task are often not corrected using knowledge uncovered while solving another sub-task down the pipeline.Realizing these weaknesses, researchers have turned to joint inference approaches in recent years. One such approach involves the use of Markov logic, which is defined as a set of weighted first-order logic formulas and, at a high level, unifies first-order logic with probabilistic graphical models. It is an ideal modeling language (knowledge representation) for compactly representing relational and uncertain knowledge in NLP. In a typical use case of MLNs in NLP, the application designer describes the background knowledge using a few first-order logic sentences and then uses software packages such as Alchemy, Tuffy, and Markov the beast to perform learning and inference (prediction) over the MLN. However, despite its obvious advantages, over the years, researchers and practitioners have found it difficult to use MLNs effectively in many NLP applications. The main reason for this is that it is hard to scale inference and learning algorithms for MLNs to large datasets and complex models, that are typical in NLP.In this tutorial, we will introduce the audience to recent advances in scaling up inference and learning in MLNs as well as new approaches to make MLNs a \"black-box\" for NLP applications (with only minor tuning required on the part of the user). Specifically, we will introduce attendees to a key idea that has emerged in the MLN research community over the last few years, lifted inference , which refers to inference techniques that take advantage of symmetries (e.g., synonyms), both exact and approximate, in the MLN . We will describe how these next-generation inference techniques can be used to perform effective joint inference. We will also present our new software package for inference and learning in MLNs, Alchemy 2.0, which is based on lifted inference, focusing primarily on how it can be used to scale up inference and learning in large models and datasets for applications such as semantic similarity determination, information extraction and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Self-Instantiated Recurrent Units with Dynamic Soft Recursion\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Aston Zhang, Yi Tay, Yikang Shen, Alvin Chan, Shuai Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) is proposed with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Abstract:** While standard recurrent neural networks explicitly impose a chain structure on different forms of data, they do not have an explicit bias towards recursive self-instantiation where the extent of recursion is dynamic. Given diverse and even growing data modalities (e.g., logic, algorithmic input and output, music, code, images, and language) that can be expressed in sequences and may bene\ufb01t from more architectural \ufb02exibility, we propose the self-instantiated recurrent unit (Self-IRU) with a novel inductive bias towards dynamic soft recursion. On one hand, the Self-IRU is characterized by recursive self-instantiation via its gating functions, i.e., gating mechanisms of the Self-IRU are controlled by instances of the Self-IRU itself, which are repeatedly invoked in a recursive fashion. On the other hand, the extent of the Self-IRU recursion is controlled by gates whose values are between 0 and 1 and may vary across the temporal dimension of sequences, enabling dynamic soft recursion depth at each time step. The architectural \ufb02exibility and effectiveness of our proposed approach are demonstrated across multiple data modalities. For example, the Self-IRU achieves state-of-the-art performance on the logical inference dataset [Bowman et al., 2014] even when comparing with competitive models that have access to ground-truth syntactic information.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Reliability-aware Dynamic Feature Composition for Name Tagging\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Ying Lin, Liyuan Liu, Heng Ji, Dong Yu, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel reliability-aware name tagging model that is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms and improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Abstract:** Word embeddings are widely used on a variety of tasks and can substantially improve the performance. However, their quality is not consistent throughout the vocabulary due to the long-tail distribution of word frequency. Without sufficient contexts, rare word embeddings are usually less reliable than those of common words. However, current models typically trust all word embeddings equally regardless of their reliability and thus may introduce noise and hurt the performance. Since names often contain rare and uncommon words, this problem is particularly critical for name tagging. In this paper, we propose a novel reliability-aware name tagging model to tackle this issue. We design a set of word frequency-based reliability signals to indicate the quality of each word embedding. Guided by the reliability signals, the model is able to dynamically select and compose features such as word embedding and character-level representation using gating mechanisms. For example, if an input word is rare, the model relies less on its word embedding and assigns higher weights to its character and contextual features. Experiments on OntoNotes 5.0 show that our model outperforms the baseline model by 2.7% absolute gain in F-score. In cross-genre experiments on five genres in OntoNotes, our model improves the performance for most genre pairs and obtains up to 5% absolute F-score gain.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Logiformer: A Two-Branch Graph Transformer Network for Interpretable\n  Logical Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Fangzhi Xu, Jun Liu, Qika Lin, Yudai Pan, Lingling Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine reading comprehension has aroused wide concerns, since it explores\nthe potential of model for text understanding. To further equip the machine\nwith the reasoning capability, the challenging task of logical reasoning is\nproposed. Previous works on logical reasoning have proposed some strategies to\nextract the logical units from different aspects. However, there still remains\na challenge to model the long distance dependency among the logical units.\nAlso, it is demanding to uncover the logical structures of the text and further\nfuse the discrete logic to the continuous text embedding. To tackle the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end model Logiformer which utilizes a two-branch\ngraph transformer network for logical reasoning of text. Firstly, we introduce\ndifferent extraction strategies to split the text into two sets of logical\nunits, and construct the logical graph and the syntax graph respectively. The\nlogical graph models the causal relations for the logical branch while the\nsyntax graph captures the co-occurrence relations for the syntax branch.\nSecondly, to model the long distance dependency, the node sequence from each\ngraph is fed into the fully connected graph transformer structures. The two\nadjacent matrices are viewed as the attention biases for the graph transformer\nlayers, which map the discrete logical structures to the continuous text\nembedding space. Thirdly, a dynamic gate mechanism and a question-aware\nself-attention module are introduced before the answer prediction to update the\nfeatures. The reasoning process provides the interpretability by employing the\nlogical units, which are consistent with human cognition. The experimental\nresults show the superiority of our model, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art single model on two logical reasoning benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-02T08:34:59Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-08T06:28:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Echotune: A Modular Extractor Leveraging the Variable-Length Nature of\n  Speech in ASR Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Sizhou Chen, Songyang Gao, Sen Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has proven to be highly effective for Automatic\nSpeech Recognition (ASR) tasks, becoming a foundational component for a\nplethora of research in the domain. Historically, many approaches have leaned\non fixed-length attention windows, which becomes problematic for varied speech\nsamples in duration and complexity, leading to data over-smoothing and neglect\nof essential long-term connectivity. Addressing this limitation, we introduce\nEcho-MSA, a nimble module equipped with a variable-length attention mechanism\nthat accommodates a range of speech sample complexities and durations. This\nmodule offers the flexibility to extract speech features across various\ngranularities, spanning from frames and phonemes to words and discourse. The\nproposed design captures the variable length feature of speech and addresses\nthe limitations of fixed-length attention. Our evaluation leverages a parallel\nattention architecture complemented by a dynamic gating mechanism that\namalgamates traditional attention with the Echo-MSA module output. Empirical\nevidence from our study reveals that integrating Echo-MSA into the primary\nmodel's training regime significantly enhances the word error rate (WER)\nperformance, all while preserving the intrinsic stability of the original\nmodel.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-14T14:51:51Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-08T03:30:34Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. IGLU: Efficient GCN Training via Lazy Updates\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Sundararajan Sellamanickam, Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain, Aditya Sinha, S Deepak Narayanan*\n\n**Abstract:** Training multi-layer Graph Convolution Networks (GCN) using standard SGD techniques scales poorly as each descent step ends up updating node embeddings for a large portion of the graph. Recent attempts to remedy this sub-sample the graph that reduces compute but introduce additional variance and may offer suboptimal performance. This paper develops the IGLU method that caches intermediate computations at various GCN layers thus enabling lazy updates that significantly reduce the compute cost of descent. IGLU introduces bounded bias into the gradients but nevertheless converges to a first-order saddle point under standard assumptions such as objective smoothness. Benchmark experiments show that IGLU offers up to 1.2% better accuracy despite requiring up to 88% less compute.\n\n**Conference:** iglu-efficient-gcn-training-via-lazy-updates-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient GCNs*\n\n*Ajitesh Srivastava, Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful models for learning representations of attributed graphs. To scale GCNs to large graphs, state-of-the-art methods use various layer sampling techniques to alleviate the \"neighbor explosion\" problem during minibatch training. We propose GraphSAINT, a graph sampling based inductive learning method that improves training efficiency and accuracy in a fundamentally different way. By changing perspective, GraphSAINT constructs minibatches by sampling the training graph, rather than the nodes or edges across GCN layers. Each iteration, a complete GCN is built from the properly sampled subgraph. Thus, we ensure fixed number of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction. Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation, and extend GraphSAINT with many architecture variants (e.g., graph attention, jumping connection). GraphSAINT demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and training time on five large graphs, and achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores for PPI (0.995) and Reddit (0.970).\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Mamba YOLO: SSMs-Based YOLO For Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced SSM Techniques*\n\n*Xinzhong Zhu, Huiying Xu, Chen Li, Zeyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Propelled by the rapid advancement of deep learning technologies, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Researchers have continuously explored innovative applications of reparameterization, efficient layer aggregation networks, and anchor-free techniques on the foundation of YOLO. To further enhance detection performance, Transformer-based structures have been introduced, significantly expanding the model's receptive field and achieving notable performance gains. However, such improvements come at a cost, as the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. Fortunately, the emergence of State Space Models (SSM) as an innovative technology has effectively mitigated the issues caused by quadratic complexity. In light of these advancements, we introduce Mamba-YOLO a novel object detection model based on SSM. Mamba-YOLO not only optimizes the SSM foundation but also adapts specifically for object detection tasks. Given the potential limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive field and weak image locality, we have designed the LSBlock and RGBlock. These modules enable more precise capture of local image dependencies and significantly enhance the robustness of the model. Extensive experimental results on the publicly available benchmark datasets COCO and VOC demonstrate that Mamba-YOLO surpasses the existing YOLO series models in both performance and competitiveness, showcasing its substantial potential and competitive edge.The PyTorch code is available at:\\url{https://github.com/HZAI-ZJNU/Mamba-YOLO}\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 5. RobustScanner: Dynamically Enhancing Positional Clues for Robust Text Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Hongbin Sun, Chenhao Lin, Wayne Zhang, Zhanghui Kuang, Xiaoyu Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention-based encoder-decoder framework has recently achieved impressive results for scene text recognition, and many variants have emerged with improvements in recognition quality. However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed \\emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. Free-Form Image Inpainting with Gated Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Xin Lu, Xiaohui Shen, Zhe Lin, Thomas Huang, Jimei Yang, Jiahui Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a generative image inpainting system to complete images with free-form mask and guidance. The system is based on gated convolutions learned from millions of images without additional labelling efforts. The proposed gated convolution solves the issue of vanilla convolution that treats all input pixels as valid ones, generalizes partial convolution by providing a learnable dynamic feature selection mechanism for each channel at each spatial location across all layers. Moreover, as free-form masks may appear anywhere in images with any shape, global and local GANs designed for a single rectangular mask are not applicable. Thus, we also present a patch-based GAN loss, named SN-PatchGAN, by applying spectral-normalized discriminator on dense image patches. SN-PatchGAN is simple in formulation, fast and stable in training. Results on automatic image inpainting and user-guided extension demonstrate that our system generates higher-quality and more flexible results than previous methods. Our system helps user quickly remove distracting objects, modify image layouts, clear watermarks and edit faces.

The existing GatedTTTLinear GAU, which integrates test-time training mechanisms, has shown promising performance in capturing local dependencies efficiently. However, it exhibits limitations in modeling complex global dependencies essential for understanding intricate linguistic structures and long-context relationships. Additionally, while dynamic gating mechanisms enhance information flow control, the current architecture lacks the capability to exploit structured relational information within the data. Incorporating graph convolutional operations into the GAU can address these shortcomings by enabling the model to capture both local and global dependencies more effectively. Furthermore, integrating State Space Models (SSMs) can enhance the model's scalability and efficiency, allowing it to handle longer sequences without significant computational overhead. This proposal aims to enhance the GatedTTTLinear GAU by integrating dynamic gating mechanisms, graph convolutional operations, and SSMs to create a more robust and efficient architecture for autoregressive language models.\n\n## Related Work\n\nSeveral advancements have been made in refining GAUs and related architectures to better capture dependencies in sequence modeling:\n\n1. **Dynamic Gating Mechanisms:**\n   - **Griffin: Mixing Gated Linear Recurrences with Local Attention for Efficient Language Models** introduces a combination of gated linear recurrences with local attention, demonstrating improved efficiency and long-range dependency modeling.\n   - **Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks** by Dauphin et al.

However, it faces significant challenges in modeling complex global dependencies crucial for understanding long-context and intricate linguistic structures. The primary issues can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Limited Global Dependency Modeling:**\n   - The GatedTTTLinear GAU predominantly focuses on local interactions, which restricts its ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for contextual understanding in language tasks.\n\n2. **Inefficient Information Flow Control:**\n   - While dynamic gating mechanisms aid in controlling information flow, they lack the granularity and structured relational modeling provided by graph convolutional operations, leading to suboptimal information retention and propagation across layers.\n\n3. **Scalability Constraints:**\n   - Handling longer sequences with the current architecture can lead to increased computational and memory overheads, limiting the model's scalability and efficiency in processing extensive texts.\n\n4. **Trade-offs Between Performance and Efficiency:**\n   - Enhancing global dependency modeling often comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. Striking a balance between capturing complex dependencies and maintaining computational efficiency is a critical challenge.\n\n### Mathematical Perspective\n\nLet \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) represent the input embeddings, where \\( B \\) is the batch size, \\( L \\) is the sequence length, and \\( D \\) is the embedding dimension. The GatedTTTLinear GAU processes the input as:\n\n\\[\nY = \\sigma(XW_g + b_g) \\odot (XW + b)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( W_g \\) and \\( b_g \\) are parameters for gating, \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid activation, and \\( W \\) and \\( b \\) are linear transformation parameters. While this mechanism effectively captures local dependencies, it lacks the structural relational modeling that graph convolutions provide.\n\nBy integrating graph convolutional operations, the GAU can be reformulated to incorporate relational dependencies as follows:\n\n\\[\nY = \\text{GraphConv}\\left(\\sigma(XW_g + b_g) \\odot (XW + b)\\right)\n\\]\n\nFurthermore, incorporating SSMs can enhance state integration:\n\n\\[\nZ' = \\text{SSM}(Y, Z)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( Z \\) represents the intermediate state variables, and \\( Z' \\) are the updated states.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n\n- **Performance vs. Computational Efficiency:**\n  - Incorporating GCNs and SSMs increases the model's capacity to capture complex dependencies but also introduces additional computational overhead. Efficient implementation strategies and dynamic gating can mitigate these costs.\n\n- **Model Complexity vs. Scalability:**\n  - Enhancing the GAU with multiple advanced mechanisms increases model complexity. However, leveraging SSMs and efficient graph convolutions can ensure that scalability and computational efficiency are maintained.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selection of GAU to Modify\n\n```selection\nGatedTTTLinear\n```\n\n### Proposed Modifications\n\n1. **Integration of Graph Convolutional Operations:**\n   - **Graph Convolution Layer:**\n     - Introduce a graph

state variables efficiently, allowing the GAU to handle longer sequences with linear complexity.\n     - This involves replacing traditional recurrent state updates with SSM-based state integrations that are computationally efficient and scalable.\n   - **Parallel Processing:**\n     - Leverage the parallelizability of SSMs to maintain training and inference efficiency, ensuring that the model

the flow of information based on the complexity and relevance of the input context.\n     - Implement attention-based gating to dynamically adjust the emphasis on different parts of the input sequence.\n   - **Sparse Activation:**\n     - Introduce sparsity in the gating mechanism to allow selective activation of sub-modules, thereby optimizing computational resources and reducing unnecessary computations.\n\n4. **Hardware-Efficient Implementations:**\n   - **Efficient Memory Access Patterns:**\n     - Optimize memory access patterns for graph convolutional operations and SSM

This integration aims to enhance the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies crucial for understanding complex linguistic structures and long-context relationships. By incorporating graph convolutions, the GAU can effectively model relational dependencies, while the integration of SSMs ensures scalability and computational efficiency, enabling the handling of longer sequences without prohibitive computational costs. The optimized dynamic gating mechanisms facilitate selective information flow, balancing performance with efficiency. Overall, GatedGraphSSM is expected to outperform existing state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness to varied inputs, and efficiency in both training and inference, positioning it as a competitive architecture in the landscape of modern autoregressive language models.\n\n## References\n\n1.
