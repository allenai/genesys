LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F. Chen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, Patrick Gallinari*\n\n**Published in:** Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs that effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models are a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models.

It is derived by introducing latent space, noise information, and guidance constraint into the denoising cost function. A self-correction alternative optimization algorithm is proposed to split the novel cost function into three alternative subproblems, i.e. , guidance representation (GR), degradation estimation (DE) and reconstruction (RE) subproblems. Finally, we implement the optimization process by a deep unfolding network consisting of GR, DE and RE networks. For higher performance of the DE network, a novel parameter-free noise feature adaptive enhancement (NFAE) layer is proposed. To synchronously and dynamically realize internal-external feature information mining in the RE network, a novel feature multi-modulation attention (FM 2 A) module is proposed. Our approach thereby leverages the advantages of deep learning, while also bene\ufb01ting from the principled denoising provided by the classical model-based formulation. To the best of our knowledge, our enhanced latent space blind model, optimization scheme, NFAE and FM 2 A have not been reported in the previous literature.

However, in domains with very long sequence lengths the $\\mathcal{O}(T^2)$ memory and $\\mathcal{O}(T^2 H)$ compute costs can make using transformers infeasible. Motivated by problems in malware detection, where sequence lengths of $T \\geq 100,000$ are a roadblock to deep learning, we re-cast self-attention using the neuro-symbolic approach of Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR). In doing so we perform the same high-level strategy of the standard self-attention: a set of queries matching against a set of keys, and returning a weighted response of the values for each key. Implemented as a ``Hrrformer'' we obtain several benefits including $\\mathcal{O}(T H \\log H)$ time complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(T H)$ space complexity, and convergence in $10\\times$ fewer epochs. Nevertheless, the Hrrformer achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy on LRA benchmarks and we are able to learn with just a single layer. Combined, these benefits make our Hrrformer the first viable Transformer for such long malware classification sequences and up to $280\\times$ faster to train on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost\n\n*From Search Query: log space attention implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, Yu-Xiang Wang, Sheng Zha, G. Karypis*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique is developed that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially private (DP) optimization is the standard paradigm to learn large neural networks that are accurate and privacy-preserving. The computational cost for DP deep learning, however, is notoriously heavy due to the per-sample gradient clipping. Existing DP implementations are 2-1000X more costly in time and space complexity than the standard (non-private) training. In this work, we develop a novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost. Specifically, BK enables DP training on large models and high dimensional data to be roughly as fast and memory-saving as the standard training, whereas previous DP algorithms can be inefficient or incapable of training due to memory error. The computational advantage of BK is supported by the complexity analysis as well as extensive experiments on vision and language tasks. Our implementation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with very small extra cost: on GPT2 and at almost the same memory cost (<1% overhead), BK has 1.03X the time complexity of the standard training (0.83X training speed in practice), and 0.61X the time complexity of the most efficient DP implementation (1.36X training speed in practice).

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: log space attention implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, W. Neiswanger, P. Xie, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO, is introduced with a novel dataflow graph that allows to develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O( d^2), and enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: log space attention implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, focusing on log-space attention mechanisms, memory optimization, and efficient state caching and compression, here are some key points and techniques that can be beneficial:\n\n### Log-Space Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Log-Space Computation**:\n   Log-space attention mechanisms can significantly reduce computational and memory costs. Instead of computing the softmax of query-key similarities directly, these methods use the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. This approach maintains expressiveness while reducing the computational cost to linear complexity per token[3|.\n   - For example, the \"Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token\" method quantifies pairwise query-key similarity using logarithms, which allows for efficient implementation with constant memory per token.\n\n2. **Stick-Breaking Attention**:\n   This method, proposed in the \"Stick-breaking Attention\" paper, computes attention weights in a log-space manner to avoid underflow issues. It uses a stick-breaking process to allocate attention weights, which naturally incorporates recency bias and avoids the need for position embeddings. The computations are performed in log-space to prevent underflow and ensure numerical stability.\n\n### Memory Optimization Techniques in Transformer Architectures\n\n1. **Flash Attention**:\n   Flash Attention is a method designed to reduce the memory footprint of attention mechanisms. It avoids realizing the full attention matrix by computing attention weights and accumulating the weighted sum in tiles, which significantly reduces memory usage. This approach is particularly useful for long sequences and can be adapted for other attention mechanisms like stick-breaking attention.\n\n2. **Efficient State Caching**:\n   Efficient caching strategies are crucial for handling long sequences. The \"Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling\" paper proposes using routing between hierarchical levels and efficient caching strategies for intermediate states. This approach helps in managing long-term dependencies without excessive memory usage.\n\n3. **Selective Feature Retention**:\n   To optimize memory, selective feature retention based on importance can be implemented. This involves retaining only the most relevant features at each level, reducing the overall memory footprint. This technique aligns with the idea of adaptive routing between scales and dynamic feature selection.\n\n### Efficient State Caching and Compression Methods\n\n1. **Bi-Level Attention Structure**:\n   The \"LLM Maybe LongLM\" paper introduces a bi-level attention structure that combines grouped attention and neighbor attention. This structure allows for efficient long-range modeling without fine-tuning and helps in managing the context window efficiently, reducing the need for extensive state caching.\n\n2. **Transient Global Attention**:\n   The \"LongT5\" architecture incorporates a transient global attention mechanism that efficiently handles long sequences. This mechanism ensures that the model can attend to relevant parts of the input sequence without maintaining a large cache of intermediate states.\n\n3. **NeuZip Compression**:\n   NeuZip is an algorithm that compresses neural networks while maintaining their full abilities. It can be applied to compress the state representations and intermediate caches, reducing the memory footprint during training and inference.\n\n### Implementation and Optimization\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**:\n   To enhance computational efficiency, parallel processing techniques can be employed. The Transformer architecture, particularly with self-attention mechanisms, is well-suited for parallelization on GPUs. Efficient parallel processing can be achieved by decomposing the attention mechanism into feedforward networks, as seen in the original Transformer paper.\n\n2. **Optimizer Efficiency**:\n   Optimizers like Adam and its variants can be optimized for memory efficiency. Techniques such as using preconditioners (e.g., Shampoo) and reducing the memory load of stored statistics can help in scaling large models efficiently.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, the researcher can significantly improve the memory efficiency, computational overhead, feature integration, and state management of the autoregressive language model.\n\n- **Log-space attention mechanisms** reduce computational and memory costs.\n- **Flash Attention and bi-level attention structures** optimize memory usage and state caching.\n- **Transient global attention and selective feature retention** enhance the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently.\n- **NeuZip compression and efficient optimizers** further optimize memory and computational resources.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: state space model compression implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

Differentially Private Optimization on Large Model at Small Cost\n\n*From Search Query: state space model compression implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, Yu-Xiang Wang, Sheng Zha, G. Karypis*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique is developed that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially private (DP) optimization is the standard paradigm to learn large neural networks that are accurate and privacy-preserving. The computational cost for DP deep learning, however, is notoriously heavy due to the per-sample gradient clipping. Existing DP implementations are 2-1000X more costly in time and space complexity than the standard (non-private) training. In this work, we develop a novel Book-Keeping (BK) technique that implements existing DP optimizers (thus achieving the same accuracy), with a substantial improvement on the computational cost. Specifically, BK enables DP training on large models and high dimensional data to be roughly as fast and memory-saving as the standard training, whereas previous DP algorithms can be inefficient or incapable of training due to memory error. The computational advantage of BK is supported by the complexity analysis as well as extensive experiments on vision and language tasks. Our implementation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy with very small extra cost: on GPT2 and at almost the same memory cost (<1% overhead), BK has 1.03X the time complexity of the standard training (0.83X training speed in practice), and 0.61X the time complexity of the most efficient DP implementation (1.36X training speed in practice). We open-source the codebase for the BK algorithm at the FastDP library (https://github.com/awslabs/fast-differential-privacy).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space model compression implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space model compression implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on state space models, hardware-efficient compression techniques, and memory optimization strategies for long sequences is crucial. Here\u2019s a detailed analysis based on the provided keywords and context:\n\n### State Space Model Implementations in Transformer Architectures\n\nState space models (SSMs) offer a promising approach to handle long sequences efficiently in transformer architectures.\n\n- **LOCOST Architecture**: This architecture bypasses the traditional self-attention mechanism, reducing the complexity from \\(O(L^2)\\) to \\(O(L \\log L)\\) for long sequences. It effectively handles sequences up to 600K tokens and achieves significant memory savings during both training and inference.\n- **Recurrent Memory Transformer**: This model incorporates recurrent structures to store and process local and global information, enabling the passage of information between segments of long sequences. This approach enhances the flow of information and can be integrated with SSMs for better performance.\n- **Luna**: This model uses linear unified nested attention, which packs the input sequence into a fixed-length sequence and then unpacks it using a second attention function. This method allows for efficient scaling and can be combined with SSMs to enhance long-range dependency modeling.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Compression Techniques\n\nSeveral techniques can be employed to compress models efficiently, making them more suitable for hardware-constrained environments.\n\n- **Pruning**: This involves removing weights or neurons that contribute little to the model's output. Techniques like weight pruning and neuron pruning can significantly reduce the model size without substantial loss in accuracy.\n- **Quantization**: Reducing the precision of weights and activations, such as converting 32-bit floating-point numbers to 8-bit integers, can decrease the model size and improve inference speed. Methods like Deep Compression, which includes pruning and quantization, are widely used for efficient AI computing.\n- **Knowledge Distillation**: This method involves training a smaller model (the student) to replicate the behavior of a larger model (the teacher). This technique is effective in transferring knowledge from complex models to simpler ones, making them more hardware-efficient.\n\n### Memory Optimization Strategies for Long Sequences\n\nOptimizing memory usage is critical for handling long sequences in autoregressive language models.\n\n- **Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO)**: This method reduces redundant copies of data on GPUs by partitioning optimizer states, gradients, and parameters. ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity further extend this by offloading data to CPUs and using NVMe memory, respectively, to handle larger models.\n- **LoMA (Lossless Compressed Memory Attention)**: This technique compresses the KV cache after every generated token with a specified compression ratio and target compressed length. This process occurs within a single inference pass, reducing memory requirements without losing information.\n- **Log-Space Computations**: Implementing log-space attention can maintain model expressiveness while reducing computational complexity. This approach avoids explicit attention matrix computation, resulting in constant cost per token and efficient scaling[Analysis].\n\n### Integration and Hardware Optimization\n\nCombining these techniques and ensuring hardware-aware implementation is essential.\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search**: This approach enables the design, optimization, and deployment of AI models on resource-constrained hardware devices. Techniques like the \"once-for-all network\" can be used to optimize models for specific hardware.\n- **Collaborative Hardware and Software Design**: Optimizing both hardware and software together can address the challenges of large model training. This includes minimizing data movement, using energy-efficient hardware, and leveraging techniques like ZeRO to manage memory and computational resources efficiently.\n\nBy integrating state space models, employing hardware-efficient compression techniques, and optimizing memory usage, researchers can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models. These approaches can help in achieving lower perplexity, higher accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, and better overall performance with larger models and more data.\n",

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33: $1474-1487,2020 \\mathrm{a}$.

Historically, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been the natural choice for this task and led to early breakthroughs in the field. However, RNNs suffer from the vanishing and exploding gradient problem, often making them unstable to train on long sequences (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber (1997)). Gated variants such as LSTM and GRU were developed to address this issue but are still inherently inefficient to train due to their non-linear recurrent nature. Furthermore, their sequential nature leads to an inductive bias towards recent inputs, limiting their\npractical ability to draw long-range dependencies. This inspired the attention mechanism (Garg et al. (2019)), which was first introduced as an addition to RNN for language translation, allowing the model to draw pairwise global dependencies between input data points. Vaswani et al. (2023) took this further with Transformer, which completely gets rid of recurrence and just relies on attention. The main advantages of Transformers are their efficient parallelizable training on modern hardware and their ability to draw global pairwise dependencies. The latter property comes at the price of quadratic complexity $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ compared to the linear complexity $O(l)$ of RNNs. This poses a practical bottleneck for many applications, for instance limiting the document length a transformer based language model can perform reasoning on. Therefore, much effort has been put into finding attention replacements with improved complexity. While these variants such as Reformer, Linformer and Performer offer a reduced complexity of $O(l \\log l)$ or $O(l)$ the original transformer with only minor adjustments prevailed due to its stronger practical performance. Furthermore, the departure from recurrence eliminated the locality bias of the model to pay more attention the recent inputs. While the absence of this bias is advantageous for some tasks, it has proven to be disadvantageous for others. This led to a line of work dedicated to injecting locality bias into Transformer (Ma et al. (2023), Huang et al. (2023)). Meanwhile, the works of Gu et al. (2022) on the initialization of discretized State Space Models (SSMs) lead to a resurgence of linear RNNs for modeling long sequences. The most prominent model of this class S4 and its simplified diagonal variant S4D, achieve remarkable results on the long-range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al. (2020)), a benchmark designed to test a models ability to model long-range dependencies. SSMs can be trained efficiently by exploiting their linear and timeinvariant nature. By rewriting the linear recurrence as a long convolution, it can be computed through the Fourier domain in $O(l \\log l)$ time complexity. Smith et al. (2023b) introduced S5, which further simplifies the application of SSMs and popularized the use of associative scan implementations for fast parallelized training. Still, SSMs are heavily dependent on involved initialization schemes. Motivated by the question whether such tedious initialization is really necessary, Orvieto et al. (2023) developed the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) which is on par with S4, S4D and S5 while only requiring much simpler initialization. ## Our contributions to this line of work are three-fold:\n\n- We show that existing models only utilize a special case of linear recurrence. Motivated by this observation, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes existing linear recurrent models by utilizing data-controlled gating of inputs, hidden states and outputs. GateLoop can be trained efficiently in $O(l \\log l)$ making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. - Furthermore, we derive an equivalent $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ mode which links GateLoop to Transformer and prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relativepositional information to attention. - Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, our results show that GateLoop outperforms the state of the art models Transformer, Hyena (Poli et al. (2023)) and S5-Hyena (Smith et al. (2023a)) on the WikiText103 benchmark for autoregressive language modeling. ## 2 PRELIMINARIES\n\nWe consider the task of approximating sequence-to-sequence mappings. The model takes a multichannel input sequence $x=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{l}\\right\\}$ packed as a matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d_{x}}$ and outputs $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d_{y}}$. A common assumption in this context is causality, implying that for modeling $y_{n}$, only information from all $x_{m}$ with $m \\leq n$ may be used. This enables efficient training strategies such as autoregressive language modeling. ### 2.1 RECURRENT NEural NETWORK\n\nA Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layer approximates a sequence-to-sequence mapping through the following recurrence relation involving learnable parameters $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h} \\times d_{h}}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h} \\times d_{x}}, C \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{y} \\times d_{h}}$ and an activation function $\\sigma 1$\n\n$$\nh_{n}=\\sigma\\left(A h_{n-1}+B x_{n}\\right), \\quad y_{n}=C h_{n}\n$$\n\nCommon choices for $\\sigma$ are tanh or sigmoid. If we chose $\\sigma$ to be the identity function, the RNN layer becomes linear. ### 2.2 State Space ModeL\n\nThe continuous state space model (SSM) is characterized by the differential equation 2 Here, $\\tilde{A} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{h} \\times d_{h}}, \\tilde{B} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{h} \\times d_{x}}, \\tilde{C} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{y} \\times d_{h}}$ are complex valued, the function $\\Re($.$) extracts the$ real part and $\\vec{h}(0)$ is defined to be 0 . $$\n\\frac{d \\tilde{h}(t)}{d t}=\\tilde{A} \\tilde{h}(t)+\\tilde{B} x(t), \\quad y(t)=\\Re(\\tilde{C} \\tilde{h}(t))\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\tilde{A}$ can be diagonalized through its eigenvalue decomposition $\\tilde{A}=V \\Lambda V^{-1}$. In this representation, $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and $V$ is the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors. Now, by absorbing $V$ and $V^{-1}$ into $\\tilde{C}$ and $\\tilde{B}$, respectively, we obtain the diagonalized SSM. For more details on this procedure, please see Smith et al. (2023b). $$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\bar{B}=V^{-1} \\tilde{B}, \\quad \\bar{C}=\\tilde{C} V, & \\bar{h}(t)=V^{-1} \\tilde{h}(t) \\\\\n\\frac{d \\bar{h}(t)}{d t}=\\Lambda \\bar{h}(t)+\\bar{B} x(t), & y(t)=\\Re(\\bar{C} \\bar{h}(t))\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn order to utilize the SSMs practically for sequence modeling, they can be discretized, e.g., through the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$, bilinear, or Euler method. Given a fixed discretization step-size $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the ZOH method yields the linear recurrence relation\n\n$$\nh_{n}=A h_{n-1}+B x_{n}, \\quad y_{n}=\\Re\\left(C h_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith the parameterization:\n\n$$\nA=\\exp (\\Delta \\Lambda), \\quad B=\\Lambda^{-1}(A-I) \\bar{B}, \\quad C=\\bar{C}\n$$\n\nDiscretizing the state space model (4) gives a linear RNN layer (1) involving special reparameterizations of its weights. While this result is simply the solution of the ZOH method application, it is worth paying attention to its interpretability. Specifically, consider the influence of the discretization step size:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\Delta \\rightarrow 0}(A, B)=(I, 0)\n$$\n\nIn the limit $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$, no new information enters the state space model and the hidden state remains constant. A small $\\Delta$ leads to a sequence-to-sequence mapping with small rates of change, while a large $\\Delta$ leads to large rates of change. It becomes clear, that the step-size has vital impact on the model's retain/forget properties. For S5, Smith et al. (2023b) define $\\Delta$ as a learnable parameter vector, where the default values for initialization are logarithmically spaced from 0.001 up to 0.1 .\n```\n\n#### 5.

The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: gated state space model implementation parallel processing\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: gated state space model implementation parallel processing*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 337  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 4.

It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.56)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/51 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\n(2020), but the elementwise operations in the recurrent update cannot make use of tensor cores and result in low arithmetic intensity. Hence, while the recurrent form generally has the lowest total FLOPs among the three forms, this does not translate to actual wall-time efficiency. And while it is theoretically possible to parallelize linear recurrences via the parallel scan algorithm, this method requires materializing the 2D hidden state for each time step. This incurs a significant memory I/O burden, thereby offsetting the benefits of parallelism over the sequence length and resulting in slow actual running speeds, as in Katsch (2023). Parallel form. The parallel form could be as efficient as FlashAttention using similar I/O optimization techniques, as demonstrated by Qin et al. (2023b). However, the high number of FLOPs (due to the quadratic complexity) makes the long-sequence training expensive, the same issue that the na\u00efve implementation of softmax attention would suffer from. Chunkwise form. The chunkwise parallel form, which interpolates between the parallel and recurrent forms with an extra \"parameter\" $C$, makes it possible to more easily make the above tradeoffs for fine-grained optimization. Unlike the recurrent form, most operations can be done via matmuls, enabling the use of tensor cores (if $C$ is set to a multiple of 16). Though the chunkwise training algorithm has been discussed before in the literature (Hua et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023a), most implementations are not I/O-aware and thus slower than FlaShATtENTION for moderate sequence lengths (e.g., 2K-4K). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=622&width=663&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=257)\n\nFigure 1: (a) FLASHLINEARATTENTION without materialization. This version is more memory-efficient. (b-c) FlASHLINEARATTENTION with materialization. This version enables sequence-level chunkwise parallelism. ### 3.3 FlashLinearAttention: Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention with the Chunkwise Form\n\nWe describe our I/O-aware, hardware-efficient implementation of the chunkwise form. We give two versions, whose forward and backward passes differ depending on whether the chunk-level hidden states $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ are materialized in HBM. See Alg. 1 and Fig. 1 for the forward pass. (Alg. 2 in the appendix describes the backward pass.) At a high level, we use tiling to load tensors block-by-block and re-use tensor blocks on chip to avoid multiple HBM I/O as much as possible. For example, when $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ is loaded to SRAM, both $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{S}$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{K}_{[n]}^{\\top} \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_{[n]}$ can be computed on chip, which avoids loading $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ twice, thus saving HBM I/O. The non-materialization version computes $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ sequentially for $n \\in[N]$, using SRAM to temporarily store $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$, which is memory-efficient. This version parallelizes across batch size, number of heads, and head dimensions, but lacks sequence-level parallelim. When the batch size is large, this level of parallelism is sufficient to enable high GPU occupancy. In long-sequence and large scale training settings where batch size is small, the SMs cannot be fully exploited in this case. The materialization version first performs the inter-chunk recurrence (Eq. 2) and stores all $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ for $n \\in[N]$ in HBM. Then, the $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ 's can be computed in parallel for all chunks. This approach offers better parallelism but increases the memory footprint by approximately 10-20\\%. We mitigate this through recomputation, where the hidden states discarded after the forward pass and recomputed during the backward pass. We find this introduces a small runtime overhead but significantly reduces the memory footprint, and we adopt this strategy by default. Figure 2 shows the speed and memory footprint of our implementation. Both versions of FLASHLINEARATTENTION are substantially faster than FlASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=475&width=811&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2: Speed comparison on a single H100 GPU with batch size 32 , number of heads 16 , head dimension 64 , and chunk size 64.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism (Avg.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, W. Neiswanger, P. Xie, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO, is introduced with a novel dataflow graph that allows to develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O( d^2), and enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient for Nonconvex Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Xiangru Lian, Yijun Huang, Y. Li, Ji Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An ergodic convergence rate is established for both asynchronous parallel implementations of stochastic gradient and it is proved that the linear speedup is achievable if the number of workers is bounded by $\\sqrt{K}$ ($K$ is the total number of iterations).\n\n**Abstract:** Asynchronous parallel implementations of stochastic gradient (SG) have been broadly used in solving deep neural network and received many successes in practice recently. However, existing theories cannot explain their convergence and speedup properties, mainly due to the nonconvexity of most deep learning formulations and the asynchronous parallel mechanism. To fill the gaps in theory and provide theoretical supports, this paper studies two asynchronous parallel implementations of SG: one is on the computer network and the other is on the shared memory system. We establish an ergodic convergence rate $O(1/\\sqrt{K})$ for both algorithms and prove that the linear speedup is achievable if the number of workers is bounded by $\\sqrt{K}$ ($K$ is the total number of iterations). Our results generalize and improve existing analysis for convex minimization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 482  (*Influential: 55*)\n\n#### 3. Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning by Modeling Previous Task Interrelations via Pareto Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Yichen Wu, Hong Wang, Peilin Zhao, Yefeng Zheng, Ying Wei, Long-Kai Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reformulates replay-based CL methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework and incorporates the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned tasks and de-sign a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current task.\n\n**Abstract:** Catastrophic forgetting remains a core challenge in continual learning (CL), where the models struggle to retain previous knowledge when learning new tasks. While existing replay-based CL methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge by utilizing a memory buffer to store data from previous tasks, they generally overlook the interdependence between previously learned tasks and fail to encapsulate the optimally integrated knowledge in previous tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance of the previous tasks. Against this issue, we first reformulate replay-based CL methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework. We then incorporate the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned tasks and de-sign a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current task. To further stabilize the gradients of different tasks, we carefully devise a hyper-gradient-based implementation manner for POCL. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate that the proposed POCL outperforms current state-of-the-art CL methods across multiple datasets and different settings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Such a structural constraint comes with the advantage that the update computation can be parallelized across multiple independent tasks. Our main contribution is to demonstrate that the convergence of these methods can significantly be improved by a randomization technique which corresponds to repartitioning coordinates across tasks during the optimization procedure. We provide a theoretical analysis that accurately characterizes the expected convergence gains of repartitioning and validate our findings empirically on various traditional machine learning tasks. From an implementation perspective, block separable models are well suited for parallelization and, when shared memory is available, randomization can be implemented on top of existing methods very efficiently to improve convergence.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization parallel scan implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory hierarchy optimization, efficient parallel scan algorithms, and hardware-aware tiling strategies, here are some detailed insights and techniques that can be beneficial:\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization Techniques in Deep Learning\n\n### Optimizing Intermediate Memory\n- The Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT) approach is particularly relevant here. It involves partitioning the input into mini-sequences to reduce the memory footprint during training. This method helps in managing the large intermediate values generated by transformer blocks, which can otherwise overwhelm the memory capacity of GPUs.\n- Activation recomputation, also known as gradient checkpointing, is another technique that trades computation for memory. By discarding intermediate activations during the forward pass and recomputing them as needed during the backward pass, this method significantly reduces memory usage for large models or long sequences.\n\n### Memory Hierarchy Utilization\n- Understanding the memory hierarchy is crucial. In computer architecture, the memory hierarchy separates storage into levels based on response time, complexity, and capacity. Optimizing for this hierarchy involves minimizing the need to access lower, slower levels of memory. For example, using cache efficiently and reducing cache misses can significantly improve performance.\n- For GPUs, optimizing memory access patterns is key. This includes using kernel fusion to mitigate memory overheads associated with self-attention operations and deploying optimized memory access patterns to achieve linear memory scaling.\n\n## Efficient Parallel Scan Algorithm Implementations\n\n### Parallel Processing Strategies\n- The GateLoop model provides insights into efficient parallel processing. It generalizes linear recurrent models by employing data-controlled state transitions, offering both a low-cost O(l) recurrent mode and an efficient O(l log\u2082 l) parallel mode. This approach can be adapted to improve the parallelizability of autoregressive models.\n- IO-aware algorithms are essential for efficient parallel scan implementations. These algorithms should be designed to optimize memory access patterns, reducing the overhead of data movement between different levels of the memory hierarchy.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Parallel Algorithms\n- Hardware-aware parallel algorithms can be designed to leverage the specific capabilities of the hardware. For instance, using linear attention forms that allow for hardware-efficient training, as seen in the HGRN2 model, can significantly improve parallel processing efficiency.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Tiling Strategies for Neural Networks\n\n### Tiling and Memory Access Optimization\n- Tiling strategies involve dividing the data into smaller blocks (tiles) to optimize memory access. This approach ensures that frequently accessed data is kept in faster memory levels, such as caches. For neural networks, tiling can be applied to both the input data and the model's weights to minimize memory traffic and maximize the use of faster memory.\n- Optimizing memory access patterns through tiling can help in reducing the latency and bandwidth issues associated with caches. By ensuring that the data is accessed in a pattern that minimizes cache misses, the overall performance of the model can be improved.\n\n### Log-Space Computations and Adaptive Compression\n- Log-space computations can help in reducing the memory footprint by representing large values in a more compact form. This technique, combined with adaptive compression methods, can further optimize memory usage without significant loss in model performance.\n- Adaptive compression techniques can be integrated to dynamically adjust the precision of model parameters and activations based on their importance, further optimizing memory efficiency and computational resources.\n\n## Integration and Implementation Considerations\n\n### Selective State Space Models and Gated Mechanisms\n- Integrating selective state space models (SSMs) with gated mechanisms can enhance the model's ability to selectively propagate or forget information, which is crucial for efficient memory management and parallel processing. Models like Mamba and GateLoop provide insights into how these mechanisms can be implemented effectively.\n\n### Dense Connections and Feature Integration\n- Dense connections between layers, as seen in the DenseMamba model, can enhance information retention and integration while maintaining training parallelizability and inference efficiency. This approach ensures that the model can leverage dense connections without compromising on hardware efficiency.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are optimized for memory hierarchy, parallel processing, and hardware-aware tiling, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/63 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n65). The MIT Press, 1971. [47] H.

However, besides the impressive performance, the quadratic time and space complexity of Transformers with respect to sequence length pose significant limitations for handling long sequences. While efficient Transformer architectures like Linformer and Performer with linear complexity have emerged as promising solutions, their theoretical understanding remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Sumformer, a novel and simple architecture capable of universally approximating equivariant sequence-to-sequence functions. We use Sumformer to give the first universal approximation results for Linformer and Performer.

Score: 0.01)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Accelerating Toeplitz Neural Network with Constant-time Inference Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: log-space numerical stability precision analysis*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting Toeplitz Neural Networks to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling Tnns to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Toeplitz Neural Networks (TNNs) have exhibited outstanding performance in various sequence modeling tasks. They outperform commonly used Transformer-based models while benefiting from log-linear space-time complexities. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) achieve lower performance than TNNs in language modeling but offer the advantage of constant inference complexity. In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this, we formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution. We demonstrate how to transform the target equation into a Vandermonde linear system problem, which can be efficiently solved using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Notably, our method requires no training and maintains numerical stability. It can be also applied to any LongConv-based model. To assess its effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on language modeling tasks across various settings. Additionally, we compare our method to other gradient-descent solutions, highlighting the superior numerical stability of our approach.

The cornerstone of our proposed architecture is the composition of time and graph convolutional filters followed by pointwise nonlinear activation functions. We introduce a generic definition of convolution operators that mimic the diffusion process of signals over its underlying support. On top of this definition, we propose space-time graph convolutions that are built upon a composition of time and graph shift operators. We prove that ST-GNNs with multivariate integral Lipschitz filters are stable to small perturbations in the underlying graphs as well as small perturbations in the time domain caused by time warping. Our analysis shows that small variations in the network topology and time evolution of a system does not significantly affect the performance of ST-GNNs. Numerical experiments with decentralized control systems showcase the effectiveness and stability of the proposed ST-GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. A Framework for Fast and Stable Representations of Multiparameter Persistent Homology Decompositions\n\n*From Search Query: log-space numerical stability precision analysis*\n\n*David Loiseaux, Mathieu Carri\u00e8re, A. Blumberg*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new general representation framework that leverages recent results on multiparameter persistent homology is introduced, rich in information, fast to compute, and encompasses previous approaches, establishing theoretical stability guarantees under this framework.\n\n**Abstract:** Topological data analysis (TDA) is an area of data science that focuses on using invariants from algebraic topology to provide multiscale shape descriptors for geometric data sets such as point clouds. One of the most important such descriptors is {\\em persistent homology}, which encodes the change in shape as a filtration parameter changes; a typical parameter is the feature scale. For many data sets, it is useful to simultaneously vary multiple filtration parameters, for example feature scale and density. While the theoretical properties of single parameter persistent homology are well understood, less is known about the multiparameter case. In particular, a central question is the problem of representing multiparameter persistent homology by elements of a vector space for integration with standard machine learning algorithms. Existing approaches to this problem either ignore most of the multiparameter information to reduce to the one-parameter case or are heuristic and potentially unstable in the face of noise. In this article, we introduce a new general representation framework that leverages recent results on {\\em decompositions} of multiparameter persistent homology. This framework is rich in information, fast to compute, and encompasses previous approaches. Moreover, we establish theoretical stability guarantees under this framework as well as efficient algorithms for practical computation, making this framework an applicable and versatile tool for analyzing geometric and point cloud data. We validate our stability results and algorithms with numerical experiments that demonstrate statistical convergence, prediction accuracy, and fast running times on several real data sets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: log-space numerical stability precision analysis*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. Stochastic Runge-Kutta Accelerates Langevin Monte Carlo and Beyond\n\n*From Search Query: log-space numerical stability precision analysis*\n\n*Xuechen Li, Denny Wu, Lester W. Mackey, Murat A. Erdogdu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The convergence rate of sampling algorithms obtained by discretizing smooth Ito diffusions exhibiting fast Wasserstein-$2$ contraction is established, based on local deviation properties of the integration scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Sampling with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods often amounts to discretizing some continuous-time dynamics with numerical integration. In this paper, we establish the convergence rate of sampling algorithms obtained by discretizing smooth Ito diffusions exhibiting fast Wasserstein-$2$ contraction, based on local deviation properties of the integration scheme. In particular, we study a sampling algorithm constructed by discretizing the overdamped Langevin diffusion with the method of stochastic Runge-Kutta. For strongly convex potentials that are smooth up to a certain order, its iterates converge to the target distribution in $2$-Wasserstein distance in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\epsilon^{-2/3})$ iterations. This improves upon the best-known rate for strongly log-concave sampling based on the overdamped Langevin equation using only the gradient oracle without adjustment. In addition, we extend our analysis of stochastic Runge-Kutta methods to uniformly dissipative diffusions with possibly non-convex potentials and show they achieve better rates compared to the Euler-Maruyama scheme in terms of the dependence on tolerance $\\epsilon$. Numerical studies show that these algorithms lead to better stability and lower asymptotic errors.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on numerical stability, precision, and stability guarantees, here are some key points and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Numerical Stability Analysis in Log-Space Computations\nThe paper on \"Improving Numerical Stability of Normalized Mutual Information Estimator on High Dimensions\" provides a relevant example of how logarithmic transformations can improve numerical stability in high-dimensional calculations. Although this work is not directly on language models, the technique of using logarithmic transformations to avoid numerical overflow can be applied to log-space computations in neural networks. This approach ensures that calculations remain stable and precise, even in high-dimensional settings.\n\n## Precision and Error Propagation in Neural Networks\nFor precision and error propagation, understanding the stability of fixed-point iterations and convergence properties is crucial. The Wikipedia article on \"Fixed-point iteration\" discusses how different methods (like Newton's method, Halley's method, and convergence acceleration techniques) can affect the precision and stability of iterative computations. These principles can be applied to analyze and improve the precision of neural network computations, especially in the context of autoregressive models where each step depends on the previous one.\n\n## Stability Guarantees for Normalization Techniques\nNormalization techniques are critical in deep learning models to ensure stability and prevent exploding or vanishing gradients. The analysis of stability in normalization techniques can be linked to the broader concept of stability analysis in numerical methods. For instance, stability analysis in numerical integration methods helps ensure that computed solutions remain accurate over iterations and under small variations in inputs. This concept can be extended to normalization techniques in neural networks, where maintaining stability is essential for consistent performance.\n\n## Error Analysis in Hierarchical Computations\nHierarchical computations, such as those in autoregressive models, involve sequential dependencies that can propagate errors. The principles of fixed-point iteration and stability analysis can help in understanding how errors propagate through these hierarchical computations. By ensuring that each step of the computation is stable and converges to a fixed point, the overall error propagation can be managed more effectively.\n\n## Numerical Precision Trade-offs in Deep Learning\nThe trade-offs between numerical precision, memory efficiency, and computational efficiency are well-documented in recent works on hardware-efficient neural network implementations. For example, the \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" and \"Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers\" papers discuss how tiling strategies, blockwise computation, and communication overlap can optimize memory and computation trade-offs. These strategies are crucial for maintaining numerical precision while ensuring efficient hardware utilization.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Papers like \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" and \"Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\" provide insights into hardware-aware implementations, GPU kernel optimizations, and memory access patterns that are essential for maintaining numerical stability and precision in deep learning models.\n\n- **Integration Techniques**: For multi-scale processing and feature combination strategies, ensuring that the integration of different components maintains numerical stability is key. This can be achieved by applying the principles of stability analysis and log-space computations to these integration techniques.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only numerically stable and precise but also efficient in terms of hardware utilization and scalable with larger models and datasets.\n",

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: log-space normalization memory-efficient*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Guo-Jun Qi, Qi Tian, H. Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We solve it by introducing edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.

Efficient Score Matching with Deep Equilibrium Layers\n\n*From Search Query: log-space normalization memory-efficient*\n\n*Yuhao Huang, Qingsong Wang, Akwum Onwunta, Bao Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives is provided and enables the development of deep and expressive models with improved performance and comparable computational and memory costs over shallow architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Score matching methods, which estimate probability densities without computing the normalization constant, are particularly useful in deep learning. However, the computational and memory costs of score matching methods can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data or complex models, particularly due to the derivatives or Hessians of the log density function appearing in the objective function. Some existing approaches modify the objective function to reduce the quadratic computational complexity for the Hessian computation. However, the memory bottle-neck of score matching methods remains for deep learning. This study improves the memory efficiency of score matching by leveraging deep equilibrium models. We provide a theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach enables the development of deep and expressive models with improved performance and comparable computational and memory costs over shallow architectures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 4.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: log-space normalization memory-efficient*\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design with a focus on log-space normalization, memory efficiency, and hardware-aware optimization, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Log-space Operations in Neural Networks\n\n- Log-space operations are crucial for maintaining constant cost per token and optimizing memory usage. The concept of log-space computations is similar to the approach used in \"Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token\", which provides a theoretical foundation for log-space operations. This method can be adapted for normalization layers to achieve constant memory per token.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- Memory-efficient normalization techniques are essential for scaling models. The work on \"Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling\" by Li et al. (2023) discusses efficient memory management and parallel processing strategies, which can be applied to normalization layers.\n- The use of tiling strategies for memory access optimization, as mentioned in the initial analysis, can be further explored. This approach can help in reducing memory usage while maintaining computational performance.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization Techniques for Normalization\n\n- Hardware-aware implementations are vital for optimizing the performance of normalization layers. The study on \"LLM Maybe LongLM: Self-Extend LLM Context Window Without Tuning\" by Jin et al. (2024) provides insights on hardware optimization and scaling strategies, which can be applied to normalization layers.\n- Techniques such as batch normalization and layer normalization, while not specifically discussed in the provided sources, are standard methods that can be optimized for hardware efficiency. For example, using techniques like quantization and pruning can enhance hardware efficiency without significant loss in performance.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Log-Space Computations\n\n- The stability of log-space operations is a critical concern. While the provided sources do not directly address stability analysis, it is important to verify the numerical precision and stability of log-space operations. This can be done by analyzing the impact of log transformations on the normalization quality and ensuring that the operations do not introduce significant errors or instabilities.\n- The vanishing gradient problem, discussed in the context of recurrent neural networks, can also be relevant here. Ensuring that the log-space operations do not exacerbate this issue is crucial.\n\n## Gated Feature Selection Mechanisms in Normalization Layers\n\n- Gated feature selection mechanisms, such as those proposed in the GatedLogHRMSNorm, can be explored further. This involves integrating gated mechanisms to select features across different scales, which can enhance the model's expressiveness and efficiency.\n- The use of gated mechanisms can be compared to other feature selection methods, such as those used in attention mechanisms, to understand their effectiveness and potential trade-offs.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Normalization Techniques**: Exploring alternative normalization techniques, such as those discussed in \"Exploring beyond Affine Transform for Interpretable Neural Network\" which involves using metrics and generalized measures of distance, can provide insights into more efficient and interpretable normalization methods.\n- **Spectral Regularization**: Techniques like spectral regularization, which help in controlling the spectral norm of weights and maintaining trainability, can be beneficial in ensuring the stability and performance of the model.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages log-space normalization, memory-efficient implementations, and hardware-aware optimization techniques.\n",

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.16)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

Following the observation, we aim at associating contextualized representations with relevant (contextualized) representations across languages with the help of co-occurrence counts. The result is MLM-GC (MLM with Global Co-occurrence) pre-training that the model learns local bidirectional information from MLM and global co-occurrence information from a log-bilinear regression. Experiments show that MLM-GC pre-training substantially outperforms MLM pre-training for 4 downstream cross-lingual tasks and 1 additional monolingual task, showing the advantages of forming isomorphic spaces across languages.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design with a focus on log-space stability, normalization, parallel processing, and memory efficiency, here are some key findings and references that align with the specified details:\n\n## Log-Space Normalization Stability Analysis and Precision Considerations\n\n- The paper \"Improving Numerical Stability of Normalized Mutual Information Estimator on High Dimensions\" discusses a logarithmic transformation technique to improve numerical stability in high-dimensional spaces, which can be analogous to log-space operations in deep learning. This technique ensures numerical stability without compromising precision, a crucial aspect for log-space normalization stability.\n\n## Parallel Processing Techniques for Normalization Layers\n\n- The concept of the \"normalized Transformer\" in the context of nGPT (Normalized GPT) involves hyperspherical parameter optimization and variable-metric optimization. While this work does not explicitly discuss parallel processing, it highlights the efficiency gains from normalization techniques that could be optimized for parallel processing. For instance, the normalization steps could be parallelized across different tokens or layers, leveraging the multi-step optimizer nature of the normalized Transformer.\n\n## Memory Access Pattern Optimization for Neural Network Operations\n\n- The work on \"PC-DARTS\" (Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search) emphasizes the importance of memory efficiency and batch size implications. Although it does not specifically focus on normalization layers, the strategies discussed (such as reducing memory cost and optimizing batch sizes) can be applied to memory access pattern optimization for normalization layers. Tiling strategies and hardware-aware implementations are crucial here.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- The paper \"Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\" provides insights into efficient normalization schemes. It discusses how normalization methods can be optimized to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, which can lead to hardware-efficient implementations. This work, while not specifically focused on hardware, lays the groundwork for optimizing normalization layers for hardware efficiency.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Log-Space Operations in Deep Learning\n\n- The theoretical analysis from \"Efficient Score Matching with Deep Equilibrium Layers\" is relevant here. This work leverages deep equilibrium models and applies implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives, providing a theoretical framework that can be extended to log-space operations. This framework can help in understanding and optimizing log-space normalization stability and precision.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Normalization on Hypersphere**: The nGPT work normalizes all vectors to lie on a unit norm hypersphere, which allows for efficient computations and potentially better stability. This approach can be explored for log-space normalization to ensure stability and precision.\n\n- **Memory Efficiency and Parallelization**: Optimizing memory access patterns and leveraging parallel processing techniques, such as those discussed in PC-DARTS, can significantly improve the efficiency of normalization layers. This involves careful design of tiling strategies and ensuring hardware compatibility.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient, stable, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage log-space normalization, parallel processing, and optimized memory access patterns.\n",

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

However, the training and inference costs of these large Transformer language models are prohibitive, thus necessitating more research in identifying more efficient variants. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective modification to the Transformer architecture inspired by the literature in statistical language modeling, by augmenting the model with n-grams that are constructed from a discrete latent representation of the text sequence. We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Memory-Efficient Pipeline-Parallel DNN Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*D. Narayanan, Amar Phanishayee, Kaiyu Shi, Xie Chen, M. Zaharia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining, able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Many state-of-the-art results in domains such as NLP and computer vision have been obtained by scaling up the number of parameters in existing models. However, the weight parameters and intermediate outputs of these large models often do not fit in the main memory of a single accelerator device; this means that it is necessary to use multiple accelerators to train large models, which is challenging to do in a time-efficient way. In this work, we propose PipeDream-2BW, a system that performs memory-efficient pipeline parallelism, a hybrid form of parallelism that combines data and model parallelism with input pipelining. Our system uses a novel pipelining and weight gradient coalescing strategy, combined with the double buffering of weights, to ensure high throughput, low memory footprint, and weight update semantics similar to data parallelism. In addition, PipeDream-2BW automatically partitions the model over the available hardware resources, while being cognizant of constraints such as compute capabilities, memory capacities, and interconnect topologies, and determines when to employ existing memory-savings techniques, such as activation recomputation, that trade off extra computation for lower memory footprint. PipeDream-2BW is able to accelerate the training of large language models with up to 2.5 billion parameters by up to 6.9x compared to optimized baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 169  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 4. LLM in a flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Keivan Alizadeh-Vahid, Iman Mirzadeh, Dmitry Belenko, Karen Khatamifard, Minsik Cho, C. C. D. Mundo, Mohammad Rastegari, Mehrdad Farajtabar*\n\n**TL;DR:** The integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are central to modern natural language processing, delivering exceptional performance in various tasks. However, their substantial computational and memory requirements present challenges, especially for devices with limited DRAM capacity. This paper tackles the challenge of efficiently running LLMs that exceed the available DRAM capacity by storing the model parameters in flash memory, but bringing them on demand to DRAM. Our method involves constructing an inference cost model that takes into account the characteristics of flash memory, guiding us to optimize in two critical areas: reducing the volume of data transferred from flash and reading data in larger, more contiguous chunks. Within this hardware-informed framework, we introduce two principal techniques. First,\"windowing\"strategically reduces data transfer by reusing previously activated neurons, and second,\"row-column bundling\", tailored to the sequential data access strengths of flash memory, increases the size of data chunks read from flash memory. These methods collectively enable running models up to twice the size of the available DRAM, with a 4-5x and 20-25x increase in inference speed compared to naive loading approaches in CPU and GPU, respectively. Our integration of sparsity awareness, context-adaptive loading, and a hardware-oriented design paves the way for effective inference of LLMs on devices with limited memory.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Meta Neural Heuristic for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zizhen Zhang, Zhiguang Cao, Te Ye, Siyuan Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems, which is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural heuristics based on deep reinforcement learning have exhibited promise in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). However, they are still struggling to achieve high learning efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems. Specifically, for the training process, a (partial) architecture-shared multi-task model is leveraged to achieve parallel learning for the meta-model, so as to speed up the training; meanwhile, a scaled symmetric sampling method with respect to the weight vectors is designed to stabilize the training. For the fine-tuning process, an efficient hierarchical method is proposed to systematically tackle all the subproblems. Experimental results on the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) show that, EMNH is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency, and yield competitive solutions to the strong traditional heuristics while consuming much shorter time.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Alpaka - An Abstraction Library for Parallel Kernel Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Andreas Kn\u00fcpfer, Ren\u00e9 Widera, Erik Zenker, Wolfgang E. Nagel, Michael Bussmann, Benjamin Worpitz, Guido Juckeland, Axel Huebl*\n\n**Abstract:** Porting applications to new hardware or programming models is a tedious and\nerror prone process. Every help that eases these burdens is saving developer\ntime that can then be invested into the advancement of the application itself\ninstead of preserving the status-quo on a new platform.\n  The Alpaka library defines and implements an abstract hierarchical redundant\nparallelism model. The model exploits parallelism and memory hierarchies on a\nnode at all levels available in current hardware. By doing so, it allows to\nachieve platform and performance portability across various types of\naccelerators by ignoring specific unsupported levels and utilizing only the\nones supported on a specific accelerator. All hardware types (multi- and\nmany-core CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators) are supported for and can be\nprogrammed in the same way. The Alpaka C++ template interface allows for\nstraightforward extension of the library to support other accelerators and\nspecialization of its internals for optimization.\n  Running Alpaka applications on a new (and supported) platform requires the\nchange of only one source code line instead of a lot of \\#ifdefs.\n\n**Published:** 2016-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Decision Tree Ensembles for Energy-Efficient Inference on IoT Edge Nodes\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Daniele Jahier Pagliari, Massimo Poncino, Paolo Montuschi, Enrico Macii, Alessio Burrello, Francesco Daghero*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, there is a growing need for energy-efficient Machine Learning (ML) models that can run on constrained edge nodes. Decision tree ensembles, such as Random Forests (RFs) and Gradient Boosting (GBTs), are particularly suited for this task, given their relatively low complexity compared to other alternatives. However, their inference time and energy costs are still significant for edge hardware. Given that said costs grow linearly with the ensemble size, this paper proposes the use of dynamic ensembles, that adjust the number of executed trees based both on a latency/energy target and on the complexity of the processed input, to trade-off computational cost and accuracy. We focus on deploying these algorithms on multi-core low-power IoT devices, designing a tool that automatically converts a Python ensemble into optimized C code, and exploring several optimizations that account for the available parallelism and memory hierarchy. We extensively benchmark both static and dynamic RFs and GBTs on three state-of-the-art IoT-relevant datasets, using an 8-core ultra-lowpower System-on-Chip (SoC), GAP8, as the target platform. Thanks to the proposed early-stopping mechanisms, we achieve an energy reduction of up to 37.9% with respect to static GBTs (8.82 uJ vs 14.20 uJ per inference) and 41.7% with respect to static RFs (2.86 uJ vs 4.90 uJ per inference), without losing accuracy compared to the static model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Parallel Programming for FPGAs\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization memory hierarchy parallel processing*\n\n*Ryan Kastner, Stephen Neuendorffer, Janarbek Matai*\n\n**Abstract:** This book focuses on the use of algorithmic high-level synthesis (HLS) to\nbuild application-specific FPGA systems. Our goal is to give the reader an\nappreciation of the process of creating an optimized hardware design using HLS.\nAlthough the details are, of necessity, different from parallel programming for\nmulticore processors or GPUs, many of the fundamental concepts are similar. For\nexample, designers must understand memory hierarchy and bandwidth, spatial and\ntemporal locality of reference, parallelism, and tradeoffs between computation\nand storage. This book is a practical guide for anyone interested in building\nFPGA systems. In a university environment, it is appropriate for advanced\nundergraduate and graduate courses. At the same time, it is also useful for\npracticing system designers and embedded programmers. The book assumes the\nreader has a working knowledge of C/C++ and includes a significant amount of\nsample code. In addition, we assume familiarity with basic computer\narchitecture concepts (pipelining, speedup, Amdahl's Law, etc.). A knowledge of\nthe RTL-based FPGA design flow is helpful, although not required.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware optimization, memory hierarchy management, parallel processing strategies, communication patterns, and memory access optimization, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques for Normalization Layers\n\n- While the provided sources do not specifically address normalization layers, general hardware-specific optimizations are crucial. For instance, optimizing memory access and reducing data movement can significantly impact performance. Techniques like using mixed-precision training and optimizing memory bandwidth can be applied to various layers, including normalization layers. For example, the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO) and its variants can reduce the memory footprint during training, which can be beneficial for normalization layers as well.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Management in Deep Learning Models\n\n- Effective use of the memory hierarchy is critical for deep learning models. This involves optimizing data placement across different levels of memory (registers, cache, main memory, and secondary storage). For large models, techniques such as model parallelism, data parallelism, and fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) help distribute the model and data across multiple devices to manage memory efficiently.\n- Optimizing memory access patterns, such as using blockwise computation and overlapping communication, can also improve performance. For example, the \"Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers\" approach leverages blockwise computation to optimize memory access and communication in the analysis note.\n\n## Parallel Processing Strategies for Neural Network Operations\n\n- Parallel processing is essential for training large neural networks. Strategies include data parallelism, model parallelism, and tensor parallelism. Data parallelism involves duplicating the model across multiple GPUs and processing different data portions simultaneously. Model parallelism splits the model across multiple GPUs, with each GPU handling different layers or parts of the model.\n- Fully sharded data parallelism (FSDP) is another emerging strategy that partitions the model and data across multiple GPUs, reducing the memory requirements on each device.\n\n## Communication Patterns in Distributed Neural Network Training\n\n- Communication patterns are crucial in distributed training. Techniques like pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism require careful management of data partitioning and communication between GPUs. For instance, index mapping controls how data is partitioned and mapped to processors, affecting inter-processor communication volume and performance.\n- Overlapping communication with computation, as seen in \"Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers,\" can also reduce the overhead of data transfer between devices in the analysis note.\n\n## Memory Access Optimization for Large-Scale Models\n\n- Optimizing memory access is vital for large-scale models. This includes deciding on the optimal memory placement for data across different memory spaces (e.g., GPU FrameBuffer, ZeroCopy memory, CPU system memory) to balance memory access speed, memory usage, and transfer overhead.\n- Techniques like rematerialization and offloading optimizer states to CPU or NVMe memory can help reduce the memory footprint during training. For example, ZeRO-Infinity explores methods to offload parameters, gradients, and activation checkpoints to manage the growing model size.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory Hierarchy and Parallelism**: Effective use of the memory hierarchy and parallel processing strategies can significantly improve the performance of autoregressive language models. This involves careful planning of data placement, communication patterns, and optimization of memory access.\n- **Hardware-Specific Implementations**: Implementing hardware-specific optimizations, such as mixed-precision training and reducing data movement, can enhance the efficiency of the model. This also includes leveraging specialized hardware like GPUs and optimizing memory bandwidth.\n- **Communication and Data Partitioning**: Optimizing communication patterns and data partitioning strategies is crucial for distributed training. Techniques like blockwise computation and overlapping communication can reduce the overhead and improve performance.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that take full advantage of modern hardware architectures.\n",

The design combines constant-cost-per-token operations through log-space normalization with adaptive gating mechanisms for selective feature integration across scales. This approach significantly reduces memory requirements and computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness through careful hardware-aware implementation.",
