A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** SPARSEK Attention is introduced, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical attention transformer linear\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer linear*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer linear*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer linear*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

MaxViT: Multi-Axis Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention transformer linear*\n\n*Yinxiao Li, Alan Bovik, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang, Han Zhang, Hossein Talebi, Zhengzhong Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively blending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to ''see'' globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains 86.5% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our model achieves 88.7% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module.

This mechanism integrates information at both node and cluster levels using multiple kernel learning, which is efficient and preserves both node-level and cluster-level details. This approach could be adapted to hierarchical structures in language models, allowing for multi-scale processing without the loss of detailed information.\n\n## Efficient Multi-Scale Processing\n\n- The \"Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network\" (STGAT) paper discusses a hierarchical transformer that captures global temporal dependencies using positional encoding and multi-head attention mechanisms. This work highlights the importance of positional encoding and multi-head attention in capturing hierarchical structures, which can be applied to language models to enhance their ability to process long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Integration of Linear Attention with Hierarchical Structures\n\n- The concept of linear attention can be integrated with hierarchical processing by leveraging the efficiency of linear attention mechanisms. For instance, the \"FastTTTLinear\" model uses Gated Linear Attention, which has linear time/space complexity and is hardware-efficient[Initial Analysis]. Combining this with the hierarchical processing from models like \"HierGPT\" could provide a balanced approach. The \"Attention-Linear Trajectory Prediction\" paper, although focused on trajectory prediction, discusses the use of linear layers to extract temporal features, which can be a useful reference for integrating linear attention in hierarchical models.\n\n## Efficient Implementation Techniques\n\n- The \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" paper provides an efficient implementation of the N2C-Attn mechanism using a cluster-wise message-passing framework, achieving linear time complexity. This approach can be a model for how to efficiently implement hierarchical attention in language models.\n\n- The \"Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network\" simplifies the computation of attention mechanisms to a linear form to manage computational costs, which is a valuable strategy for maintaining efficiency in hierarchical models.\n\n## Performance and Memory Efficiency Considerations\n\n- The \"Improving Vision Transformers by Overlapping Heads in Multi-Head Self-Attention\" paper, while focused on vision tasks, introduces the concept of overlapping heads in multi-head self-attention (MOHSA). This approach enhances information exchange between heads, which could be adapted to hierarchical language models to improve performance without significant additional computational overhead.\n\nBy combining these insights:\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Use multi-scale hierarchical processing similar to \"HierGPT\" to capture features at different granularities.\n- **Linear Attention**: Integrate linear attention mechanisms like those in \"FastTTTLinear\" to ensure efficiency, especially with long sequences.\n- **Efficient Implementation**: Employ techniques like the cluster-wise message-passing framework from \"Cluster-wise Graph Transformer\" and linear attention simplifications from \"Spatio-Temporal Graph Attention Network\" to maintain efficiency.\n- **Test-Time Adaptation**: Incorporate test-time adaptation capabilities to handle diverse inputs, as suggested by the initial analysis.\n\nThese strategies can help in designing an autoregressive language model that balances complexity with performance gains, ensuring efficient and scalable hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y. Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Score: 0.96)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 4. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Zaixin Zhang, Qi Liu, Qingyong Hu, Cheekong Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the main deficiencies of current graph transformers and formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in a number of domains including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers:(1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

SAViT: Structure-Aware Vision Transformer Pruning via Collaborative Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Chuanyang Zheng, Zheyang Li, Kai Zhang, Zhi Yang, Wenming Tan, Jun Xiao, Ye Ren, Shiliang Pu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Joint importance is introduced, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning in ViTs, and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) yield impressive performance across various vision tasks. However, heavy computation and memory footprint make them inaccessible for edge devices. Previous works apply importance criteria determined independently by each individual component to prune ViTs. Considering that heterogeneous components in ViTs play distinct roles, these approaches lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce joint importance, which integrates essential structural-aware interactions between components for the first time, to perform collaborative pruning. Based on the theoretical analysis, we construct a Taylor-based approximation to evaluate the joint importance. This guides pruning toward a more balanced reduction across all components. To further reduce the algorithm complexity, we incorporate the interactions into the optimization function under some mild assumptions. Moreover, the proposed method can be seamlessly applied to various tasks including object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, the proposed approach outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on ImageNet, increasing accuracy by 0.7% over the DeiT-Base baseline while saving 50% FLOPs. On COCO, we are the first to show that 70% FLOPs of Faster R-CNN with ViT backbone can be removed with only 0.3% mAP drop.

AKG: Automatic Kernel Generation for Neural Processing Units using Polyhedral Transformations\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Xuefeng Jin, Kun Zhang, Peng Di, Zheng Li, Yun Cheng, Chen Wu, Bin Cheng, Xiong Gao, Renwei Zhang, Zhen Geng, Wang Nie, Bojie Li, Jie Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing tensor compilers have proven their effectiveness in deploying deep neural networks on general-purpose hardware like CPU and GPU, but optimizing for neural processing units (NPUs) is still challenging due to the heterogeneous compute units and complicated memory hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, we present AKG, a tensor compiler for NPUs. AKG first lowers the tensor expression language to a polyhedral representation, which is used to automate the memory management of NPUs. Unlike existing approaches that resort to manually written schedules, AKG leverages polyhedral schedulers to perform a much wider class of transformations, and extends the semantics of the polyhedral representation to combine complex tiling techniques and hierarchical fusion strategies. We also implement the domain-specific optimization of convolution in AKG. Moreover, to achieve the optimal performance, we introduce complementary optimizations in code generation, which is followed by an auto-tuner.\r\n\r\nWe conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks ranging from single operators to end-to-end networks.

Block Transformer: Global-to-Local Language Modeling for Fast Inference\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Se-Young Yun, James Thorne, Adam Fisch, Tal Schuster, Yireun Kim, Hyunjik Jo, Taehyeon Kim, Sangmin Bae, Namgyu Ho*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents the Block Transformer architecture which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks of self-attention. To apply self-attention, the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences must be retrieved from memory at every decoding step. Thereby, this KV cache IO becomes a significant bottleneck in batch inference. We notice that these costs stem from applying self-attention on the global context, therefore we isolate the expensive bottlenecks of global modeling to lower layers and apply fast local modeling in upper layers. To mitigate the remaining costs in the lower layers, we aggregate input tokens into fixed size blocks and then apply self-attention at this coarse level. Context information is aggregated into a single embedding to enable upper layers to decode the next block of tokens, without global attention. Free of global attention bottlenecks, the upper layers can fully utilize the compute hardware to maximize inference throughput. By leveraging global and local modules, the Block Transformer architecture demonstrates 10-20x gains in inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity. Our work introduces a new approach to optimize language model inference through novel application of global-to-local modeling.

VDB-EDT: An Efficient Euclidean Distance Transform Algorithm Based on VDB Data Structure\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a fundamental algorithm, called VDB-EDT, for Euclidean distance transform (EDT) based on the VDB data structure. The algorithm executes on grid maps and generates the corresponding distance field for recording distance information against obstacles, which forms the basis of numerous motion planning algorithms. The contributions of this work mainly lie in three folds. Firstly, we propose a novel algorithm that can facilitate distance transform procedures by optimizing the scheduling priorities of transform functions, which significantly improves the running speed of conventional EDT algorithms. Secondly, we for the first time introduce the memory-efficient VDB data structure, a customed B+ tree, to represent the distance field hierarchically. Benefiting from the special index and caching mechanism, VDB shows a fast (average \\textit{O}(1)) random access speed, and thus is very suitable for the frequent neighbor-searching operations in EDT. Moreover, regarding the small scale of existing datasets, we release a large-scale dataset captured from subterranean environments to benchmark EDT algorithms. Extensive experiments on the released dataset and publicly available datasets show that VDB-EDT can reduce memory consumption by about 30%-85%, depending on the sparsity of the environment, while maintaining a competitive running speed with the fastest array-based implementation. The experiments also show that VDB-EDT can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art EDT algorithm in both runtime and memory efficiency, which strongly demonstrates the advantages of our proposed method. The released dataset and source code are available on https://github.com/zhudelong/VDB-EDT.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory optimization and efficient implementations for hierarchical transformer architectures, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Management\n\n### MemTree Algorithm\nThe MemTree algorithm introduced in leverages a dynamic, tree-structured memory representation. This approach is particularly useful for managing long-term memory in large language models. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, allowing for efficient organization, retrieval, and integration of information. It adapts the memory structure by computing and comparing semantic embeddings, which helps in handling complex reasoning and extended interactions. This hierarchical approach ensures computational efficiency and maintains a high-quality memory representation, which is crucial for autoregressive models that need to process long sequences.\n\n## Efficient Hierarchical Processing\n\n### HLogformer\nThe HLogformer architecture, as described in, is designed to process hierarchical data efficiently. It segments log data according to its hierarchical tree structure, summarizing information at each level and passing only the accumulated summary vectors to the next step. This approach significantly reduces memory and computational costs, making it suitable for autoregressive models that need to handle complex, nested data structures. By maintaining and leveraging the hierarchical structure, HLogformer can more accurately identify patterns and anomalies, which is beneficial for improving the overall performance of language models.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-offs\n\n### Mix Transformer (MiT) Encoder\nThe MiT encoder, discussed in, is part of the PtychoFormer architecture but has relevant implications for language models. The MiT encoder uses spatial reduction attention and eliminates fixed positional embedding, which reduces computational and memory costs. It also employs a Mix Feed Forward Network (Mix-FFN) that implicitly encodes positional information using zero-padded convolutions. This approach is less sensitive to untrained input resolutions and can be adapted to improve the efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerator\nThe paper on memristor-based accelerators for transformer networks highlights a hardware-efficient approach to optimize self-attention mechanisms. By using memristor-based in-memory computing, the design achieves a 10\u00d7 acceleration in transformer self-attention compared to digital counterparts. This hardware optimization can be crucial for reducing the computational latency and power consumption of autoregressive language models, making them more efficient in both training and inference.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n### Combining Hierarchical and Linear Attention\nThe analysis note and references provided suggest combining hierarchical processing with linear attention mechanisms. Approaches like H-Transformer-1D, CHELA, and Luna use hierarchical matrix structures, tiling, and nested linear attention functions to maintain expressiveness while reducing complexity. These strategies can be integrated into autoregressive models to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency, especially when dealing with long sequences and complex data structures.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory management, computational cost, and overall performance, particularly when handling hierarchical and complex data.\n",

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/41 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, 2020.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads. We show that uptrained GQA achieves quality close to multi-head attention with comparable speed to MQA.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/14 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nGeoffrey E.

Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/34 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nLin, T., Wang, Y., Liu, X., and Qiu, X.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Rethinking Decision Transformer via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: test-time optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yi Ma, Chenjun Xiao, Hebin Liang, Jianye Hao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of Hierarchical RL, and shows DT emerges as a special case of this framework with certain choices of high-level and low-level policies, and discusses the potential failure of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** Decision Transformer (DT) is an innovative algorithm leveraging recent advances of the transformer architecture in reinforcement learning (RL). However, a notable limitation of DT is its reliance on recalling trajectories from datasets, losing the capability to seamlessly stitch sub-optimal trajectories together. In this work we introduce a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of Hierarchical RL. At the time of making decisions, a high-level policy first proposes an ideal prompt for the current state, a low-level policy subsequently generates an action conditioned on the given prompt. We show DT emerges as a special case of this framework with certain choices of high-level and low-level policies, and discuss the potential failure of these choices. Inspired by these observations, we study how to jointly optimize the high-level and low-level policies to enable the stitching ability, which further leads to the development of new offline RL algorithms. Our empirical results clearly show that the proposed algorithms significantly surpass DT on several control and navigation benchmarks. We hope our contributions can inspire the integration of transformer architectures within the field of RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Unlike existing methods that focus on training phase , our method focuses test phase , i.e., correcting its prediction by itself during test time. Speci\ufb01cally, T3A adjusts a trained linear classi\ufb01er (the last layer of deep neural networks) with the following procedure: (1) compute a pseudo-prototype representation for each class using online unlabeled data augmented by the base classi\ufb01er trained in the source domains, (2) and then classify each sample based on its distance to the pseudo-prototypes. T3A is back-propagation-free and modi\ufb01es only the linear layer; therefore, the increase in computational cost during inference is negligible and avoids the catastrophic failure might caused by stochastic optimization. Despite its simplicity, T3A can leverage knowledge about the target domain by using off-the-shelf test-time data and improve performance. We tested our method on four domain generalization benchmarks, namely PACS, VLCS, Of\ufb01ceHome, and TerraIncognita, along with various backbone networks including ResNet18, ResNet50, Big Transfer (BiT), Vision Transformers (ViT), and MLP-Mixer.

A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Based Optimization Framework for Large-scale Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problems\n\n*From Search Query: test-time optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yi Ma, Xiaotian Hao, Jianye Hao, Jiawen Lu, Xingfu Liu, Xialiang Tong, M. Yuan, Zhigang Li, Jiehui Tang, Zhaopeng Meng*\n\n**TL;DR:** An upper-level agent is designed to dynamically partition the DPDP into a series of sub-problems with different scales to optimize vehicles routes towards globally better solutions and a lower-level agent is designed to solve each sub-problem by incorporating the strengths of classical operational research-based methods with reinforcement learning-based policies.\n\n**Abstract:** The Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem (DPDP) is an essential problem in the logistics domain, which is NP-hard. The objective is to dynamically schedule vehicles among multiple sites to serve the online generated orders such that the overall transportation cost could be minimized. The critical challenge of DPDP is the orders are not known a priori, i.e., the orders are dynamically generated in real-time. To address this problem, existing methods partition the overall DPDP into \ufb01xed-size sub-problems by caching online generated orders and solve each sub-problem, or on this basis to utilize the predicted future orders to optimize each sub-problem further. However, the solution quality and ef\ufb01ciency of these methods are unsatisfactory, especially when the problem scale is very large. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical optimization framework to better solve large-scale DPDPs. Speci\ufb01cally, we design an upper-level agent to dynamically partition the DPDP into a series of sub-problems with different scales to optimize vehicles routes towards globally better solutions. Besides, a lower-level agent is designed to ef\ufb01ciently solve each sub-problem by incorporating the strengths of classical operational research-based methods with reinforcement learning-based policies.

Elastic Decision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: test-time optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yueh-Hua Wu, Xiaolong Wang, Masashi Hamaya*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed Elastic Decision Transformer differentiates itself by facilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time, achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT, enabling it to\"stitch\" with a more optimal trajectory.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces Elastic Decision Transformer (EDT), a significant advancement over the existing Decision Transformer (DT) and its variants. Although DT purports to generate an optimal trajectory, empirical evidence suggests it struggles with trajectory stitching, a process involving the generation of an optimal or near-optimal trajectory from the best parts of a set of sub-optimal trajectories. The proposed EDT differentiates itself by facilitating trajectory stitching during action inference at test time, achieved by adjusting the history length maintained in DT. Further, the EDT optimizes the trajectory by retaining a longer history when the previous trajectory is optimal and a shorter one when it is sub-optimal, enabling it to\"stitch\"with a more optimal trajectory. Extensive experimentation demonstrates EDT's ability to bridge the performance gap between DT-based and Q Learning-based approaches. In particular, the EDT outperforms Q Learning-based methods in a multi-task regime on the D4RL locomotion benchmark and Atari games.

Flemme: A Flexible and Modular Learning Platform for Medical Images\n\n*From Search Query: test-time optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Yang Li, Jingyun Yang, Guoqing Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** As the rapid development of computer vision and the emergence of powerful network backbones and architectures, the application of deep learning in medical imaging has become increasingly significant. Unlike natural images, medical images lack huge volumes of data but feature more modalities, making it difficult to train a general model that has satisfactory performance across various datasets. In practice, practitioners often suffer from manually creating and testing models combining independent backbones and architectures, which is a laborious and time-consuming process. We propose Flemme, a FLExible and Modular learning platform for MEdical images. Our platform separates encoders from the model architectures so that different models can be constructed via various combinations of supported encoders and architectures. We construct encoders using building blocks based on convolution, transformer, and state-space model (SSM) to process both 2D and 3D image patches. A base architecture is implemented following an encoder-decoder style, with several derived architectures for image segmentation, reconstruction, and generation tasks. In addition, we propose a general hierarchical architecture incorporating a pyramid loss to optimize and fuse vertical features. Experiments demonstrate that this simple design leads to an average improvement of 5.60% in Dice score and 7.81% in mean interaction of units (mIoU) for segmentation models, as well as an enhancement of 5.57% in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and 8.22% in structural similarity (SSIM) for reconstruction models. We further utilize Flemme as an analytical tool to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of various encoders across different tasks.

An Optimized Deep Spiking Neural Network Architecture Without Gradients\n\n*From Search Query: test-time optimization hierarchical transformer*\n\n*and Saeed Afshar, Andr\u00e9 van Schaik, Gregory Cohen, Ying Xu, Yeshwanth Bethi*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an end-to-end trainable modular event-driven neural architecture that uses local synaptic and threshold adaptation rules to perform transformations between arbitrary spatio-temporal spike patterns. The architecture represents a highly abstracted model of existing Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architectures. The proposed Optimized Deep Event-driven Spiking neural network Architecture (ODESA) can simultaneously learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features at multiple arbitrary time scales. ODESA performs online learning without the use of error back-propagation or the calculation of gradients. Through the use of simple local adaptive selection thresholds at each node, the network rapidly learns to appropriately allocate its neuronal resources at each layer for any given problem without using an error measure. These adaptive selection thresholds are the central feature of ODESA, ensuring network stability and remarkable robustness to noise as well as to the selection of initial system parameters. Network activations are inherently sparse due to a hard Winner-Take-All (WTA) constraint at each layer. We evaluate the architecture on existing spatio-temporal datasets, including the spike-encoded IRIS, latency-coded MNIST, Oxford Spike pattern and TIDIGITS datasets, as well as a novel set of tasks based on International Morse Code that we created. These tests demonstrate the hierarchical spatio-temporal learning capabilities of ODESA. Through these tests, we demonstrate ODESA can optimally solve practical and highly challenging hierarchical spatio-temporal learning tasks with the minimum possible number of computing nodes.\n\n**Proceeding:** ieee-access-2022-8\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-22\n\n\n\n\n",

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.

Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: sparse hierarchical attention transformer\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

Revisiting Transformer-based Models for Long Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Xiang Dai, Ilias Chalkidis, S. Darkner, Desmond Elliott*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines several aspects of sparse attention (e.g., size of local attention window, use of global attention) and hierarchical encoding methods of Transformer-based transformers on four document classification datasets covering different domains.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent literature in text classification is biased towards short text sequences (e.g., sentences or paragraphs). In real-world applications, multi-page multi-paragraph documents are common and they cannot be efficiently encoded by vanilla Transformer-based models. We compare different Transformer-based Long Document Classification (TrLDC) approaches that aim to mitigate the computational overhead of vanilla transformers to encode much longer text, namely sparse attention and hierarchical encoding methods. We examine several aspects of sparse attention (e.g., size of local attention window, use of\r\nglobal attention) and hierarchical (e.g., document splitting strategy) transformers on four document classification datasets covering different domains. We observe a clear benefit from being able to process longer text, and, based on our results, we derive practical advice of applying Transformer-based models on\r\nlong document classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Selective Attention for Context-aware Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Sameen Maruf, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Gholamreza Haffari*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the progress made in sentence-level NMT, current systems still fall short at achieving fluent, good quality translation for a full document. Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are quickly becoming one of the most heavily applied deep learning architectures across modalities, domains, and tasks. In vision, on top of ongoing efforts into plain transformers, hierarchical transformers have also gained significant attention, thanks to their performance and easy integration into existing frameworks. These models typically employ localized attention mechanisms, such as the sliding-window Neighborhood Attention (NA) or Swin Transformer's Shifted Window Self Attention. While effective at reducing self attention's quadratic complexity, local attention weakens two of the most desirable properties of self attention: long range inter-dependency modeling, and global receptive field. In this paper, we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), a natural, flexible and efficient extension to NA that can capture more global context and expand receptive fields exponentially at no additional cost. NA's local attention and DiNA's sparse global attention complement each other, and therefore we introduce Dilated Neighborhood Attention Transformer (DiNAT), a new hierarchical vision transformer built upon both. DiNAT variants enjoy significant improvements over strong baselines such as NAT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. Our large model is faster and ahead of its Swin counterpart by 1.6% box AP in COCO object detection, 1.4% mask AP in COCO instance segmentation, and 1.4% mIoU in ADE20K semantic segmentation. Paired with new frameworks, our large variant is the new state of the art panoptic segmentation model on COCO (58.5 PQ) and ADE20K (49.4 PQ), and instance segmentation model on Cityscapes (45.1 AP) and ADE20K (35.4 AP) (no extra data). It also matches the state of the art specialized semantic segmentation models on ADE20K (58.1 mIoU), and ranks second on Cityscapes (84.5 mIoU) (no extra data).\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie zhou, Jiwen Lu, Benlin Liu, Wenliang Zhao, Yongming Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse hierarchical attention transformer*\n\n*Simon Du, Beidi Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Yiping Wang, Yuandong Tian*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings. Code can be found in https://github.com/facebookresearch/luckmatters/tree/yuandong3.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using efficient implementations of sparse hierarchical attention mechanisms, several papers and concepts are particularly relevant:\n\n## Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Sparse Focus Transformer\nThe Sparse Focus Transformer (SFT) described in is noteworthy for its efficient sparse attention approach. This method decomposes the computation of full attention into several faster attention operations, which when combined, approximate dense attention computation. The SFT integrates both horizontal and vertical attention kernels, allowing for a more efficient and robust capture of contextual information. This approach can significantly reduce computational and memory complexity, making it suitable for long sequences.\n\n### Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention\nThe Deformable Bi-level Routing Attention Transformer (DeBiFormer) introduced in uses a hierarchical attention mechanism that optimizes the selection of key-value pairs using agent queries. This method enhances the interpretability of queries in attention maps and adapts to data through a coarse-to-fine approach. The use of deformable attention and bi-level routing attention helps in focusing on semantically relevant regions, which can be efficient in terms of memory and computation.\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Hierarchical Matrix Structures\nThe H-Transformer-1D, as mentioned in the analysis, exploits a hierarchical matrix structure to achieve linear run time and memory complexity while maintaining performance. This approach can be integrated with sparse attention mechanisms to further enhance efficiency.\n\n### Long Document Classification\nThe work on long document classification using hierarchical encoding methods, such as sparse attention and document splitting strategies, provides insights into how to mitigate the computational overhead of vanilla transformers. This includes using local and global attention layers alternately, as seen in models like Twins, and employing regional tokens and local tokens to enrich local context with global information.\n\n## Memory Management and Computational Efficiency\n\n### SparseK and Dynamic Context Pruning\nThe SPARSEK method integrates a scoring network and differentiable top-k mask operator, enabling gradient-based optimization with linear time complexity and a constant memory footprint. Dynamic context pruning dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, significantly reducing memory requirements without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer self-attention, as described in, can significantly improve efficiency. This method performs matrix operations in an analog manner, reducing power consumption and latency, which is crucial for large-scale autoregressive models.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n### Combining Sparse and Hierarchical Attention\nTo achieve efficient implementations, combining sparse attention with hierarchical processing is key. For example, the LongFormer model introduces a spatio-temporal complexity linearly dependent on the length of the text sequence, ensuring the model can effectively utilize lower spatio-temporal complexity for modeling lengthy documents. This can be integrated with hierarchical matrix structures and dynamic pruning techniques to balance efficiency and expressiveness.\n\nBy leveraging these approaches, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of memory and computation but also scalable and robust, particularly for handling long sequences and complex contextual information.\n",

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/48 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nSmola, and Eduard H.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Learning Large-scale Neural Fields via Context Pruned Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training implementation memory optimization multi-scale*\n\n*Jihoon Tack, Subin Kim, Sihyun Yu, Jaeho Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Jonathan Schwarz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an efficient optimization-based meta-learning technique for large-scale neural field training by realizing significant memory savings through automated online context point selection and improves the quality of the meta-learned initialization by introducing a bootstrap correction.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce an efficient optimization-based meta-learning technique for large-scale neural field training by realizing significant memory savings through automated online context point selection. This is achieved by focusing each learning step on the subset of data with the highest expected immediate improvement in model quality, resulting in the almost instantaneous modeling of global structure and subsequent refinement of high-frequency details. We further improve the quality of our meta-learned initialization by introducing a bootstrap correction resulting in the minimization of any error introduced by reduced context sets while simultaneously mitigating the well-known myopia of optimization-based meta-learning. Finally, we show how gradient re-scaling at meta-test time allows the learning of extremely high-quality neural fields in significantly shortened optimization procedures. Our framework is model-agnostic, intuitive, straightforward to implement, and shows significant reconstruction improvements for a wide range of signals. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation on nine datasets across multiple multiple modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art results while providing additional insight through careful analysis of the algorithmic components constituting our method.

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training implementation memory optimization multi-scale*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, W. Neiswanger, P. Xie, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO, is introduced with a novel dataflow graph that allows to develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O( d^2), and enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Efficient Iterative Amortized Inference for Learning Symmetric and Disentangled Multi-Object Representations\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training implementation memory optimization multi-scale*\n\n*Patrick Emami, Pan He, S. Ranka, A. Rangarajan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representation learning that demonstrates strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised multi-object representation learning depends on inductive biases to guide the discovery of object-centric representations that generalize. However, we observe that methods for learning these representations are either impractical due to long training times and large memory consumption or forego key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient framework for the unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. We show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance. We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard multi-object benchmark while achieving nearly an order of magnitude faster training and test time inference over the previous state-of-the-art model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. A Computationally Efficient Sparsified Online Newton Method\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical test-time training implementation memory optimization multi-scale*\n\n*Fnu Devvrit, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Rohan Anil, Vineet Gupta, Cho-Jui Hsieh, I. Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method is introduced, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner that is as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order methods hold significant promise for enhancing the convergence of deep neural network training; however, their large memory and computational demands have limited their practicality. Thus there is a need for scalable second-order methods that can efficiently train large models. In this paper, we introduce the Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner. The algorithm emerges from a novel use of the LogDet matrix divergence measure; we combine it with sparsity constraints to minimize regret in the online convex optimization framework. Empirically, we test our method on large scale benchmarks of up to 1B parameters. We achieve up to 30% faster convergence, 3.4% relative improvement in validation performance, and 80% relative improvement in training loss, in comparison to memory efficient optimizers including first order methods. Powering the method is a surprising fact -- imposing structured sparsity patterns, like tridiagonal and banded structure, requires little to no overhead, making it as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods. In wall-clock time, tridiagonal SONew is only about 3% slower per step than first-order methods but gives overall gains due to much faster convergence. In contrast, one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) memory-intensive second-order methods, Shampoo, is unable to scale to large benchmarks. Additionally, while Shampoo necessitates significant engineering efforts to scale to large benchmarks, SONew offers a more straightforward implementation, increasing its practical appeal.

The concept of test-time training (TTT) is discussed in detail in, where it involves fine-tuning the model on each test sample using a self-supervised objective function. This can be extended to hierarchical data by adapting the model to different levels of the hierarchy.\n- For hierarchical data, the approach could involve a two-stage process: first, training the model on the main task, and then fine-tuning it at test time using a hierarchical self-supervised objective. This is similar to the approach described in, but applied in a hierarchical context.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Multi-Scale Neural Networks\n\n- Memory optimization is crucial for multi-scale neural networks. Techniques such as using larger windows with pooling attention can reduce both computational cost and memory consumption, as mentioned in Zhang et al. (2021).\n- Sparse attention mechanisms can also help in reducing memory usage. For example, the Routing Transformer and FlashAttention methods reduce the complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) or even eliminate computational complexity overhead, respectively.\n- Efficient hardware utilization, such as optimizing access patterns and using larger windows, can also help in memory optimization.\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Sparse Attention with Hierarchical Processing\n\n- Integrating sparse attention with hierarchical processing involves designing attention mechanisms that can efficiently handle hierarchical data structures. The Routing Transformer and FlashAttention methods can be adapted to accommodate hierarchical sparsity patterns, as they are designed to handle various sparsity patterns efficiently.\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms can be implemented by applying sparse attention at different levels of the hierarchy, ensuring that the model captures both local and global context efficiently.\n\n## Efficient Computation Strategies for Multi-Scale Feature Representations\n\n- Multi-scale feature representations can be efficiently computed using techniques like pooling attention, which increases the receptive fields while reducing computational and memory costs.\n- Hierarchical processing can be combined with multi-scale feature representations by processing features at different scales and levels of the hierarchy. This approach ensures that the model captures a wide range of contextual information.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Implementations of Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Hardware-aware implementations are crucial for optimizing the performance of hierarchical attention mechanisms. This involves careful consideration of memory access patterns, computational overhead, and the use of efficient algorithms that leverage hardware capabilities.\n- Techniques such as using larger windows, pooling attention, and sparse attention can be optimized for specific hardware to achieve better performance and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, the integration of hierarchical test-time training with sparse attention and multi-scale processing requires careful design and optimization. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n- **Hierarchical Test-Time Training**: Adapt TTT methods to hierarchical data by fine-tuning the model at different levels of the hierarchy.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Use sparse attention mechanisms and pooling attention to reduce memory consumption and computational cost.\n- **Integration of Sparse Attention**: Adapt sparse attention methods to handle hierarchical sparsity patterns efficiently.\n- **Efficient Computation**: Use pooling attention and hierarchical processing to compute multi-scale feature representations efficiently.\n- **Hardware-Aware Implementations**: Optimize the implementation for specific hardware to achieve better performance and efficiency.\n",

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.93)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention test-time training sparse attention patterns*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention test-time training sparse attention patterns*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Simon S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Neural Attention Distillation: Erasing Backdoor Triggers from Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention test-time training sparse attention patterns*\n\n*Yige Li, Nodens Koren, L. Lyu, X. Lyu, Bo Li, Xingjun Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel defense framework Neural Attention Distillation (NAD), which utilizes a teacher network to guide the finetuning of the backdoored student network on a small clean subset of data such that the intermediate-layer attention of the student network aligns with that of the teacher network.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) are known vulnerable to backdoor attacks, a training time attack that injects a trigger pattern into a small proportion of training data so as to control the model's prediction at the test time. Backdoor attacks are notably dangerous since they do not affect the model's performance on clean examples, yet can fool the model to make incorrect prediction whenever the trigger pattern appears during testing. In this paper, we propose a novel defense framework Neural Attention Distillation (NAD) to erase backdoor triggers from backdoored DNNs. NAD utilizes a teacher network to guide the finetuning of the backdoored student network on a small clean subset of data such that the intermediate-layer attention of the student network aligns with that of the teacher network. The teacher network can be obtained by an independent finetuning process on the same clean subset. We empirically show, against 6 state-of-the-art backdoor attacks, NAD can effectively erase the backdoor triggers using only 5\\% clean training data without causing obvious performance degradation on clean examples.

ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention test-time training sparse attention patterns*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Data Augmentation with Hierarchical SQL-to-Question Generation for Cross-domain Text-to-SQL Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention test-time training sparse attention patterns*\n\n*Ao Zhang, Kun Wu, Lijie Wang, Zhenghua Li, Xinyan Xiao, Hua Wu, Min Zhang, Haifeng Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments on three cross-domain datasets show that the proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Data augmentation has attracted a lot of research attention in the deep learning era for its ability in alleviating data sparseness. The lack of labeled data for unseen evaluation databases is exactly the major challenge for cross-domain text-to-SQL parsing. Previous works either require human intervention to guarantee the quality of generated data, or fail to handle complex SQL queries. This paper presents a simple yet effective data augmentation framework. First, given a database, we automatically produce a large number of SQL queries based on an abstract syntax tree grammar. For better distribution matching, we require that at least 80% of SQL patterns in the training data are covered by generated queries. Second, we propose a hierarchical SQL-to-question generation model to obtain high-quality natural language questions, which is the major contribution of this work. Finally, we design a simple sampling strategy that can greatly improve training efficiency given large amounts of generated data. Experiments on three cross-domain datasets, i.e., WikiSQL and Spider in English, and DuSQL in Chinese, show that our proposed data augmentation framework can consistently improve performance over strong baselines, and the hierarchical generation component is the key for the improvement.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of hierarchical attention, test-time training, sparse attention patterns, multi-scale feature integration, and memory-efficient attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that align with their goals:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms have been successfully applied in various domains, including natural language processing. For instance, hierarchical attention transformers have been used for long document classification, capturing dependencies within and across sentences.\n- The InterACT model uses hierarchical attention to capture inter-dependencies between dual-arm joint states and visual inputs, which can be analogous to handling complex dependencies in language models. It employs a Hierarchical Attention Encoder that processes input segments and captures both intra-segment and inter-segment dependencies.\n\n## Integration of Test-Time Training with Hierarchical Processing\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss the integration of test-time training with hierarchical processing, the concept of adapting hierarchical models at test time can be inferred from the flexibility of hierarchical attention mechanisms. For example, the hierarchical attention in Nova can be adapted to learn low-density semantics at different granularity levels, which could be extended to test-time training by fine-tuning the hierarchical attention layers based on the test data.\n\n## Sparse Attention Patterns and Their Implementation\n- Sparse attention patterns are crucial for efficient long-range transformers. Studies have shown that sparse attention can significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage. For instance, works like \"Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers\" and \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\" provide insights into implementing sparse attention efficiently (though not directly cited, these concepts are relevant).\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Memory-efficient attention mechanisms are essential for scaling language models. Research has shown that self-attention does not necessarily need \\(O(n^2)\\) memory, and techniques like sparse attention can be more memory-efficient. For example, \"Self-attention Does Not Need O(n^2) Memory\" discusses methods to reduce memory usage in self-attention mechanisms.\n\n## Multi-Scale Feature Integration in Transformers\n- Multi-scale feature integration is a key aspect of hierarchical processing. The HierGPT model, mentioned in the initial analysis, integrates multi-scale features through hierarchical processing. Similarly, Nova uses hierarchical self-attention to capture semantics at three granularity levels, which is a form of multi-scale feature integration.\n\n### Key Insights and References\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: InterACT and Nova models demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical attention in capturing complex dependencies, which can be applied to language models.\n- **Sparse Attention**: Implementations such as those described in \"Sparser is Faster and Less is More\" and \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention\" can help in reducing computational complexity and memory usage[References 1 and 3 from the initial analysis].\n- **Test-Time Training**: While not explicitly covered, the adaptability of hierarchical attention mechanisms suggests potential for test-time training. This could involve fine-tuning the hierarchical attention layers based on test data to enhance performance.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Studies like \"Self-attention Does Not Need O(n^2) Memory\" provide methods to make attention mechanisms more memory-efficient, which is crucial for scaling language models[Reference 2 from the initial analysis].\n- **Multi-Scale Feature Integration**: Nova's hierarchical self-attention mechanism and the concept of HierGPT's multi-scale processing can be used to integrate features at different scales, enhancing the model's ability to handle complex inputs.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention, sparse attention patterns, and multi-scale feature integration while ensuring memory efficiency and adaptability through test-time training.\n",

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.59)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/48 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nSmola, and Eduard H.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing. Our code is public.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/47 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn Int.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1506.02075, 2015.

Multi-scale Feature Learning Dynamics: Insights for Double Descent\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training hierarchical neural networks multi-scale feature processing*\n\n*M. Pezeshki, Amartya Mitra, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the origins of the less studied epoch-wise double descent in which the test error undergoes two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases, and derives closed-form analytical expressions for the evolution of generalization error over training.\n\n**Abstract:** A key challenge in building theoretical foundations for deep learning is the complex optimization dynamics of neural networks, resulting from the high-dimensional interactions between the large number of network parameters. Such non-trivial dynamics lead to intriguing behaviors such as the phenomenon of\"double descent\"of the generalization error. The more commonly studied aspect of this phenomenon corresponds to model-wise double descent where the test error exhibits a second descent with increasing model complexity, beyond the classical U-shaped error curve. In this work, we investigate the origins of the less studied epoch-wise double descent in which the test error undergoes two non-monotonous transitions, or descents as the training time increases. By leveraging tools from statistical physics, we study a linear teacher-student setup exhibiting epoch-wise double descent similar to that in deep neural networks. In this setting, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for the evolution of generalization error over training. We find that double descent can be attributed to distinct features being learned at different scales: as fast-learning features overfit, slower-learning features start to fit, resulting in a second descent in test error. We validate our findings through numerical experiments where our theory accurately predicts empirical findings and remains consistent with observations in deep neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Neural Collapse in Multi-label Learning with Pick-all-label Loss\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training hierarchical neural networks multi-scale feature processing*\n\n*Pengyu Li, Yutong Wang, Xiao Li, Qing Qu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Theoretically, under proper assumptions on the features, it is established that the only global optimizer of the pick-all-label cross-entropy loss satisfy the multi-label NC, and in practice the findings can lead to better test performance with more efficient training techniques for MLab learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We study deep neural networks for the multi-label classification (MLab) task through the lens of neural collapse (NC). Previous works have been restricted to the multi-class classification setting and discovered a prevalent NC phenomenon comprising of the following properties for the last-layer features: (i) the variability of features within every class collapses to zero, (ii) the set of feature means form an equi-angular tight frame (ETF), and (iii) the last layer classifiers collapse to the feature mean upon some scaling. We generalize the study to multi-label learning, and prove for the first time that a generalized NC phenomenon holds with the\"pick-all-label\"formulation, which we term as MLab NC. While the ETF geometry remains consistent for features with a single label, multi-label scenarios introduce a unique combinatorial aspect we term the\"tag-wise average\"property, where the means of features with multiple labels are the scaled averages of means for single-label instances. Theoretically, under proper assumptions on the features, we establish that the only global optimizer of the pick-all-label cross-entropy loss satisfy the multi-label NC. In practice, we demonstrate that our findings can lead to better test performance with more efficient training techniques for MLab learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Recently, there has been increased interest in designing GNN that scales to large graphs. Most existing methods use \"graph sampling\" or \"layer-wise sampling\" techniques to reduce training time. However, these methods still suffer from degrading performance and scalability problems when applying to graphs with billions of edges. This paper presents GBP, a scalable GNN that utilizes a localized bidirectional propagation process from both the feature vectors and the training/testing nodes. Theoretical analysis shows that GBP is the first method that achieves sub-linear time complexity for both the precomputation and the training phases. An extensive empirical study demonstrates that GBP achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly less training/testing time. Most notably, GBP can deliver superior performance on a graph with over 60 million nodes and 1.8 billion edges in less than half an hour on a single machine.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 126  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 4. What Can ResNet Learn Efficiently, Going Beyond Kernels?\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training hierarchical neural networks multi-scale feature processing*\n\n*Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved neural networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any distributional assumption, and also proves a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with respect to other learning methods including linear regression over arbitrary feature mappings.\n\n**Abstract:** How can neural networks such as ResNet efficiently learn CIFAR-10 with test accuracy more than 96%, while other methods, especially kernel methods, fall relatively behind? Can we more provide theoretical justifications for this gap? \nRecently, there is an influential line of work relating neural networks to kernels in the over-parameterized regime, proving they can learn certain concept class that is also learnable by kernels with similar test error. Yet, can neural networks provably learn some concept class BETTER than kernels? \nWe answer this positively in the distribution-free setting. We prove neural networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any distributional assumption. At the same time, we prove there are simple functions in this class such that with the same number of training examples, the test error obtained by neural networks can be MUCH SMALLER than ANY kernel method, including neural tangent kernels (NTK). \nThe main intuition is that multi-layer neural networks can implicitly perform hierarchical learning using different layers, which reduces the sample complexity comparing to \"one-shot\" learning algorithms such as kernel methods. In a follow-up work [2], this theory of hierarchical learning is further strengthened to incorporate the \"backward feature correction\" process when training deep networks. \nIn the end, we also prove a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with respect to other learning methods including linear regression over arbitrary feature mappings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 5.

It produces recommendations based on customer\u2019s implicit feedback history such as purchases, listens or watches. Our key contribution is to formulate recommendation problem as a model that encodes historical behavior to predict the future behavior using soft data split, combining predictor and auto-encoder models. We introduce convolutional layer for learning the importance (time decay) of the purchases depending on their purchase date and demonstrate that the shape of the time decay function can be well approximated by a parametrical function. We present offline experimental results showing that neural networks with two hidden layers can capture seasonality changes, and at the same time outperform other modeling techniques, including our recommender in production. Most importantly, we demonstrate that our model can be scaled to all digital categories, and we observe significant improvements in an online A/B test. We also discuss key enhancements to the neural network model and describe our production pipeline. Finally we open-sourced our deep learning library which supports multi-gpu model parallel training.

These methods can be particularly useful in hierarchical neural networks to enhance generalization capabilities.\n  - For instance, TTT involves fine-tuning the model on each test sample using a self-supervised objective function. This can be applied to hierarchical models by adapting the encoder and other components based on the test data, as seen in the context of image manipulation and shadow detection.\n  - TTA methods, which directly adapt the pre-trained model using target task data without additional proxy tasks, can also be integrated into hierarchical structures to improve performance on unseen data.\n\n## Multi-Scale Feature Processing Techniques and Memory Efficiency\n\n- Multi-scale feature processing is crucial for capturing dependencies at different scales. Hierarchical models can be designed to process features at multiple scales efficiently.\n  - Techniques like hierarchical gating mechanisms allow upper layers to model long-term dependencies and lower layers to model short-term dependencies, which can be combined with multi-scale processing[Analysis Note: Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network].\n  - Memory efficiency can be achieved through sparse attention patterns, such as those implemented in FlashAttention variants, which accommodate various sparsity patterns without computational complexity overhead[Analysis Note: Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention].\n\n## Integration Methods for Combining Hierarchical and Sparse Attention\n\n- Integrating hierarchical processing with sparse attention can be done through clustering-based approaches.\n  - ClusterFormer, for example, groups words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs attention independently for each cluster, which can be combined with hierarchical models to enhance efficiency and effectiveness[Analysis Note: ClusterFormer].\n  - Another approach is to use joint dynamics of MLP and attention, as in JoMA, which could be adapted to hierarchical structures to leverage both sparse and hierarchical attention mechanisms[Analysis Note: JoMA].\n\n## Adaptive Computation in Multi-Scale Neural Architectures\n\n- Adaptive computation can be implemented by dynamically adjusting the computational resources based on the input.\n  - In the context of test-time training, techniques like test-time token dropout (TTT-TD) can be used to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance. This involves randomly discarding tokens and using masked reconstruction as a self-supervised objective function, which can be applied to multi-scale neural architectures.\n  - Hierarchical models can also employ layer-specific roles, where different layers focus on different scales of dependencies, allowing for more efficient use of computational resources.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Models\n\n- Memory efficiency is a critical aspect, especially when dealing with large models and datasets.\n  - FlashAttention variants and other sparse attention mechanisms provide a foundation for memory-efficient implementations. These can be integrated into hierarchical models to reduce memory usage without compromising performance[Analysis Note: Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention].\n  - Clustering-based approaches, like ClusterFormer, also offer memory-efficient alternatives to pure attention sparsity, which can be beneficial in hierarchical models[Analysis Note: ClusterFormer].\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage hierarchical structures, multi-scale feature processing, and efficient attention mechanisms, all while adapting effectively at test time to improve overall performance and scalability.\n",

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nTrans.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

This approach combines sparse and dense attention, leading to significant efficiency improvements without compromising performance. It achieves a wall-clock speedup of up to 25.3X compared to the FlashAttention-2 baseline and maintains strong downstream performance.\n\n- The \"SeerAttention\" mechanism learns intrinsic sparse attention by using a learnable gate to adaptively select significant blocks in the attention map. This approach outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attention methods, offering a 5.67x speedup over FlashAttention-2 at a 32k context length with minimal perplexity loss.\n\n- The \"Block Sparse Attention\" library supports various sparse patterns, including streaming attention with token and block granularity, which can significantly reduce the computational costs of LLMs and enhance their efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Stability and Convergence Analysis of Test-Time Training\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly delve into the stability and convergence analysis of test-time training in hierarchical contexts, the concept of test-time adaptation in hierarchical structures is noted as underexplored. However, the adaptability of \"SeerAttention\" to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios suggests that learning-based sparse attention mechanisms could be more stable and adaptable during test-time training compared to predefined sparse patterns.\n\n## Memory Optimization in Multi-Scale Neural Architectures\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper emphasizes the importance of memory optimization by tiling Q, K, V matrices into chunks that fit into SRAM for efficient computation, similar to FlashAttention. This approach minimizes HBM I/O and optimizes memory access patterns, which is crucial for multi-scale neural architectures.\n\n- The \"Block Sparse Attention\" library also focuses on reducing memory movement during attention by leveraging query-aware sparsity in KV cache, which can boost throughput and efficiency in multi-scale processing.\n\n## Integration of Sparse and Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- \"SeerAttention\" integrates sparse attention with the conventional attention mechanism by using a learnable gate to select significant blocks. This integration allows for adaptive sparsity that can handle long-context tasks efficiently, which is a key aspect of hierarchical processing.\n\n- The concept of \"Head-Split Sparse-Dense Attention\" in the context of video action recognition also demonstrates the integration of sparse and dense attention mechanisms. This approach divides the attention heads into sparse and dense components, which can be adapted to hierarchical processing in language models to capture both local and global features effectively.\n\n## Efficient Computation of Multi-Scale Feature Representations\n\n- The use of sparse attention patterns, such as those in \"SeerAttention\" and \"Block Sparse Attention,\" significantly reduces the computational complexity of self-attention. For example, \"SeerAttention\" achieves a 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context length with minimal perplexity loss, offering a substantial speedup over dense attention baselines.\n\n- The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" approach also reduces computational complexity by applying unique strided attention patterns across different attention heads, which collectively cover the full context. This method results in significant speedups during both training and inference.\n\nThese findings and techniques can help researchers design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models by leveraging sparse attention patterns, optimizing memory usage, and integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms.\n",
