Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. By prioritizing a subset of key-value pairs, SPARSEK attention effectively reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model performance.\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention geometric hierarchy*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention geometric hierarchy*\n\n*Takeru Miyato, Bernhard Jaeger, Max Welling, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work argues that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure, and proposes a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Selective Attention for Context-aware Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention geometric hierarchy*\n\n*Sameen Maruf, Andr\u00e9 F. T.

Recent works in context-aware NMT consider only a few previous sentences as context and may not scale to entire documents. To this end, we propose a novel and scalable top-down approach to hierarchical attention for context-aware NMT which uses sparse attention to selectively focus on relevant sentences in the document context and then attends to key words in those sentences. We also propose single-level attention approaches based on sentence or word-level information in the context. The document-level context representation, produced from these attention modules, is integrated into the encoder or decoder of the Transformer model depending on whether we use monolingual or bilingual context. Our experiments and evaluation on English-German datasets in different document MT settings show that our selective attention approach not only significantly outperforms context-agnostic baselines but also surpasses context-aware baselines in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 166  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 5. One Ring to Rule Them All: Certifiably Robust Geometric Perception with Outliers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention geometric hierarchy*\n\n*Heng Yang, L. Carlone*\n\n**TL;DR:** Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of the relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a general and practical framework to design certifiable algorithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of a large amount of outliers. We investigate the use of a truncated least squares (TLS) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our first contribution is to show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- TLS estimation can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correctness of the certification, and the scalability of the proposed dual certifiers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention mechanisms, geometric approaches to hierarchy modeling, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Memory and Computational Efficiency\n- The paper on **SeerAttention** introduces a novel attention mechanism that learns and leverages intrinsic sparsity in attention, enhancing efficiency for long-context sequences. It uses a learnable gate to adaptively identify important blocks, achieving near-lossless accuracy with high sparsity ratios and significant speedup over dense baselines.\n- **Sparse Focus Attention** is another approach that integrates both horizontal and vertical attention kernels to reduce computational complexity. This method is efficient in terms of memory usage and demonstrates superior computational efficiency by decomposing full attention into faster attention operations.\n\n### Increased Context Length\n- Techniques like sparse attention mechanisms are being researched to extend context length without proportional computational requirements. These mechanisms allow models to allocate computational resources effectively, enhancing performance across various applications.\n\n## Geometric Approaches to Hierarchy Modeling\n\n### Hierarchy-Aware Attention\n- The concept of **Coneheads** involves hierarchy-aware attention through hyperbolic geometry. This approach better models hierarchical relationships and uses geometric structures to capture complex dependencies more efficiently (mentioned in the analysis but not directly linked here; for detailed information, refer to the original Coneheads paper).\n\n### Geometric Structures\n- While not explicitly linked, the idea of using geometric structures to model hierarchical relationships can be inferred from the need to integrate hierarchical processing with sparse patterns.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFor these applications, the causal self-attention-which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** SPARSEK Attention is introduced, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/41 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nHowever, these static methods often prove suboptimal in various scenarios [66, 2]. Alternatively, sparse patterns can be learned in a data-driven manner. For example, Reformer [39] employs locality-sensitive hashing for token clustering and do attention within a cluster, while Routing Transformers [61], Cluster-Former [74] and Clustered Attention [73] use K-Means clustering on tokens. Besides, Sparse Sinkhorn Attention [68] establishes sparsity by sorting blocks of inputs. Despite achieving sub-quadratic complexity, these methods still remain above linear complexity and face challenges when handling extremely long sequences or failing to offer constant memory cost during inference. A recent approach by Anagnostidis et al. [2] introduces a learnable, irreversible key-value pair pruning for inference-time memory efficiency with the concept of relaxing pruning actions to accumulated gating. However, this method still suffers from quadratic complexity during training, hindering its ability to expedite the training process. In this paper, we present a novel, efficient sparse attention mechanism with learnable patterns, addressing all the aforementioned challenges. ## 3 SparseK Attention\n\n### 3.1 Background\n\nSelf-Attention Given a sequence of vectors $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ where $n$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the hidden dimension, an attention head first projects $\\boldsymbol{X}$ into query, key and value vectors with $\\boldsymbol{W}_{Q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{K}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times p}$ where $p=\\frac{d}{h}$ and $h$ is the number of attention heads:\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{Q}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{Q} \\quad \\boldsymbol{K}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{K} \\quad \\boldsymbol{V}=\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W}_{V}\n$$\n\nIn the decoder-only architecture [72], a causal attention mask $\\boldsymbol{M}$ guarantees each query $q_{i}$ only attends to positions $\\leq i$. Consequently, the output $\\boldsymbol{O}$ of single-head dot-product attention is defined as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{S}=\\boldsymbol{Q} \\boldsymbol{K}^{\\top} \\quad \\boldsymbol{P}=\\operatorname{SoftMAx}(\\boldsymbol{S}+\\boldsymbol{M}) \\quad \\boldsymbol{O}=\\boldsymbol{P} \\boldsymbol{V}\n$$\n\nThe multi-head self-attention concatenates the outputs of multiple heads (indexed by subscripts) and applies a linear projection with $\\boldsymbol{W}_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ :\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{MHA}(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\text { Concatenate }\\left(\\boldsymbol{O}_{1}, \\boldsymbol{O}_{2}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{O}_{h}\\right) \\boldsymbol{W}_{O}\n$$\n\nThe quadratic complexity of self-attention is contributed by the quadratically sized attention weight $\\boldsymbol{S}$. Inspired by Ainslie et al. [1], we propose to select a constant number of key-value pairs for each query in an irreversible way (defined formally in the following subsections 3.2 and 3.3), leading to linear training complexity and a constant inference-time memory cost. For simplicity, here we omit the RoPE position embedding [64] and focus on single-head attention to illustrate our methodology. The multi-head case is briefly discussed in Appendix C.7. SparseMax operator There are many popular technical choices that relax ArgMAX operation, such as SoftMax and SparseMax [46]. Especially, SparseMax uses the Euclidean projection onto the probabilistic simplex and tends to yield sparse solutions:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{SPARSEMAX}(\\boldsymbol{z}):=\\underset{\\boldsymbol{p} \\in \\triangle^{m-1}}{\\arg \\min }\\|\\boldsymbol{p}-\\boldsymbol{z}\\|^{2}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\triangle^{m-1}=\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m} \\mid \\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{p}=1, \\boldsymbol{p} \\geq 0\\right\\}$. Building on this, we introduce SPARSEK, an extension of SparseMAX for the case where $k=\\mathbf{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{p} \\geq 1$\n\n### 3.2 Learnable Key-Value Pair Selection\n\nKey-value pair selection We use $\\Delta \\in\\{0,1\\}^{k \\times m}$ to represent the selection of $k$ key-value pairs out of $m$ entries, where $\\Delta(i, j)=1$ indicates that the $j$-th key-value pair is the $i$-th selected entry ( i.e., the $j$-th key-value pair is positioned in the $i$-th slot after sorting), and $\\Delta(i, j)=0$ otherwise.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/41 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nIn this work, we introduce SparseK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 4. An Attention Free Transformer (Avg.

Deja Vu: Contextual Sparsity for Efficient LLMs at Inference Time\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity geometric attention hardware efficient*\n\n*Zichang Liu, Jue Wang, Tri Dao, Tianyi Zhou, Binhang Yuan, Zhao Song, Anshumali Shrivastava, Ce Zhang, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** DejaVu is proposed, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have to forgo LLM's in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in wall-clock time without compromising LLM's quality or in-context learning ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face implementation, without compromising model quality.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity geometric attention hardware efficient*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity geometric attention hardware efficient*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Efficient recurrent architectures through activity sparsity and sparse back-propagation through time\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity geometric attention hardware efficient*\n\n*Anand Subramoney, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Mark Sch\u00f6ne, C. Mayr, D. Kappel*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network, which means the model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are well suited for solving sequence tasks in resource-constrained systems due to their expressivity and low computational requirements. However, there is still a need to bridge the gap between what RNNs are capable of in terms of efficiency and performance and real-world application requirements. The memory and computational requirements arising from propagating the activations of all the neurons at every time step to every connected neuron, together with the sequential dependence of activations, contribute to the inefficiency of training and using RNNs. We propose a solution inspired by biological neuron dynamics that makes the communication between RNN units sparse and discrete. This makes the backward pass with backpropagation through time (BPTT) computationally sparse and efficient as well. We base our model on the gated recurrent unit (GRU), extending it with units that emit discrete events for communication triggered by a threshold so that no information is communicated to other units in the absence of events. We show theoretically that the communication between units, and hence the computation required for both the forward and backward passes, scales with the number of events in the network. Our model achieves efficiency without compromising task performance, demonstrating competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art recurrent network models in real-world tasks, including language modeling. The dynamic activity sparsity mechanism also makes our model well suited for novel energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.

SpikePoint: An Efficient Point-based Spiking Neural Network for Event Cameras Action Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity geometric attention hardware efficient*\n\n*Hongwei Ren, Yue Zhou, Yulong Huang, Haotian Fu, Xiaopeng Lin, Jie Song, Bo-Xun Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** SpikePoint is proposed, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture that achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four event-based action recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNN methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that respond to local changes in light intensity and feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high dynamic range. Meanwhile, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable efficiency and fault tolerance. By synergistically harnessing the energy efficiency inherent in event cameras and the spike-based processing capabilities of SNNs, their integration could enable ultra-low-power application scenarios, such as action recognition tasks. However, existing approaches often entail converting asynchronous events into conventional frames, leading to additional data mapping efforts and a loss of sparsity, contradicting the design concept of SNNs and event cameras. To address this challenge, we propose SpikePoint, a novel end-to-end point-based SNN architecture. SpikePoint excels at processing sparse event cloud data, effectively extracting both global and local features through a singular-stage structure. Leveraging the surrogate training method, SpikePoint achieves high accuracy with few parameters and maintains low power consumption, specifically employing the identity mapping feature extractor on diverse datasets. SpikePoint achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four event-based action recognition datasets using only 16 timesteps, surpassing other SNN methods. Moreover, it also achieves SOTA performance across all methods on three datasets, utilizing approximately 0.3\\% of the parameters and 0.5\\% of power consumption employed by artificial neural networks (ANNs). These results emphasize the significance of Point Cloud and pave the way for many ultra-low-power event-based data processing applications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on dynamic sparsity adaptation, integration of geometric attention with sparse patterns, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity Adaptation Techniques in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper on **SeerAttention** introduces a novel attention mechanism that learns intrinsic sparse attention rather than relying on predefined patterns or heuristics. This approach uses a learnable gate to adaptively identify important blocks in the attention map, which can significantly improve efficiency and scalability, especially for long-context windows. SeerAttention achieves a high sparsity ratio with minimal perplexity loss and offers a substantial speedup over other attention mechanisms.\n\n## Integration of Geometric Attention with Sparse Patterns\n\n- While the sources provided do not directly discuss the integration of geometric attention with sparse patterns, the concept of **geometry-aware attention** can be inferred from related work. For instance, the Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism (GTA) encodes structural relationships, which could be combined with sparse attention techniques. By integrating geometric attention, models can better capture structural relationships and apply sparse patterns to reduce computational complexity. This combination could be explored by adapting GTA with the dynamic sparsity learning approach of SeerAttention.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Attention\n\n- The design of **hardware accelerators for Sparse Transformer models** is a promising direction. This involves exploiting the inherent sparsity in attention mechanisms to reduce computational requirements and improve overall efficiency. The proposal to design a specialized hardware accelerator for Sparse Transformer models focuses on optimizing performance, energy efficiency, and scalability, which aligns with the need for hardware-efficient implementations of hierarchical attention.\n\n- **Lightning Attention-2** is another relevant example, which enables linear attention to realize its theoretical benefits through tiling and hardware-aware implementation. This approach separates intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation, which can be crucial for optimizing hierarchical sparse attention mechanisms.\n\n### Key Insights and Future Directions\n\n- **Dynamic Sparsity**: Techniques like SeerAttention that learn dynamic sparsity can be integrated into hierarchical models to adaptively harness sparsity, improving efficiency without predefined patterns or heuristics.\n\n- **Geometric Structure**: Incorporating geometry-aware attention mechanisms, such as GTA, into sparse attention frameworks can enhance feature representation and capture structural relationships effectively.\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Implementations like Lightning Attention-2 and specialized hardware accelerators for Sparse Transformer models can significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of hierarchical attention mechanisms. Tiling and block-based processing are key strategies for achieving hardware efficiency.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage dynamic sparsity adaptation, geometric attention, and hardware-efficient designs to achieve better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Efficient Sparse Attention needs Adaptive Token Release\n\n*From Search Query: efficient scale integration geometric sparse attention*\n\n*Chaoran Zhang, Lixin Zou, Dan Luo, Min Tang, Xiangyang Luo, Zihao Li, Chenliang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that the adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states of the transformer achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of text-centric tasks. However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

RAP: Efficient Text-Video Retrieval with Sparse-and-Correlated Adapter\n\n*From Search Query: efficient scale integration geometric sparse attention*\n\n*Meng Cao, Haoran Tang, Jinfa Huang, Peng Jin, Can Zhang, Ruyang Liu, Long Chen, Xiaodan Liang, Li Yuan, Ge Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A low-rank modulation module to refine the per-image features from the frozen CLIP backbone, which accentuates salient frames within the video features while alleviating temporal redundancy, and an asynchronous self-attention mechanism that first selects the top responsive visual patches and augments the correlation modeling between them with learnable temporal and patch offsets.\n\n**Abstract:** Text-Video Retrieval (TVR) aims to align relevant video content with natural language queries. To date, most state-of-the-art TVR methods learn image-to-video transfer learning based on large-scale pre-trained visionlanguage models (e.g., CLIP). However, fully fine-tuning these pre-trained models for TVR incurs prohibitively expensive computation costs. To this end, we propose to conduct efficient text-video Retrieval with a sparse-andcorrelated AdaPter (RAP), i.e., fine-tuning the pre-trained model with a few parameterized layers. To accommodate the text-video scenario, we equip our RAP with two indispensable characteristics: temporal sparsity and correlation. Specifically, we propose a low-rank modulation module to refine the per-image features from the frozen CLIP backbone, which accentuates salient frames within the video features while alleviating temporal redundancy. Besides, we introduce an asynchronous self-attention mechanism that first selects the top responsive visual patches and augments the correlation modeling between them with learnable temporal and patch offsets. Extensive experiments on four TVR datasets demonstrate that RAP achieves superior or comparable performance compared to the fully fine-tuned counterpart and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient scale integration geometric sparse attention*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. SparseProp: Efficient Event-Based Simulation and Training of Sparse Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient scale integration geometric sparse attention*\n\n*Rainer Engelken*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired models that are capable of processing information in streams of action potentials. However, simulating and training SNNs is computationally expensive due to the need to solve large systems of coupled differential equations. In this paper, we introduce SparseProp, a novel event-based algorithm for simulating and training sparse SNNs. Our algorithm reduces the computational cost of both the forward and backward pass operations from O(N) to O(log(N)) per network spike, thereby enabling numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and their efficient training using backpropagation through time. By leveraging the sparsity of the network, SparseProp eliminates the need to iterate through all neurons at each spike, employing efficient state updates instead. We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseProp across several classical integrate-and-fire neuron models, including a simulation of a sparse SNN with one million LIF neurons. This results in a speed-up exceeding four orders of magnitude relative to previous event-based implementations. Our work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient scale integration geometric sparse attention*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on efficient scale integration, combining geometric and sparse attention mechanisms, and hardware-optimized implementations, here are some relevant findings and directions based on the provided analysis and search results:\n\n## Efficient Scale Integration\n\n1. **Multi-scale Processing**:\n   The need for efficient integration across multiple scales is crucial. While the provided search results do not directly address multi-scale integration in LMs, the concept can be inferred from other domains. For instance, the paper on \"One-Versus-Others Attention\" discusses scalable multimodal integration, which could be adapted to handle multi-scale information in LMs. This approach reduces computational complexity by scaling linearly with the number of modalities (or scales), which is a promising direction for efficient scale integration.\n\n## Combining Geometric and Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Geometry-Aware Attention**:\n   Geometric structures can help capture hierarchical relationships and structural information. Although the search results do not explicitly discuss geometric attention in LMs, the concept of geometry-aware attention can be integrated with sparse attention mechanisms. For example, using hyperbolic entailment cones to model hierarchical relationships can be combined with sparse attention techniques like SPARSEK Attention or Routing Transformers to capture both geometric and sparse patterns efficiently[Analysis].\n\n2. **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**:\n   Papers like \"Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers\" and \"Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\" provide insights into efficient sparse attention mechanisms. These can be combined with geometric approaches to enhance the model's ability to capture structural information while maintaining efficiency[References 1, 2].\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Implementations of Hierarchical Processing\n\n1. **Flash Attention and Tiling**:\n   Techniques such as Flash Attention and block-based processing can significantly optimize memory access patterns and improve hardware utilization. \"Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention\" discusses how to extend FlashAttention to accommodate various attention sparsity patterns, which is crucial for hardware-efficient implementations of hierarchical neural networks[References 4].\n\n2. **Fused Kernel Implementations**:\n   Fused kernel implementations can reduce overhead and improve performance. This is aligned with the need for efficient hardware utilization in hierarchical processing. By integrating fused kernel implementations with sparse and geometric attention mechanisms, the model can achieve better performance and efficiency[Analysis].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Dynamic Sparsity Mechanisms**:\n  Mechanisms like SPARSEK Attention, Routing Transformers, and DejaVu demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic sparsity in reducing computational costs and improving efficiency. These can be integrated into the hierarchical processing framework to optimize performance[Analysis].\n\n- **Contextual Sparsity**:\n  Predicting and exploiting contextual sparsity, as shown in DejaVu, can further speed up LLM inference. This can be particularly beneficial when combined with geometric and sparse attention mechanisms to optimize the model's performance across different scales[References 3].\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive LM that efficiently integrates information across multiple scales, leverages geometric and sparse attention mechanisms, and is optimized for hardware performance.\n",

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.75)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

DeFT leverages a tree-like structure to organize the model's knowledge, optimizing memory access patterns and reducing computational costs. It achieves significant speedups (up to 3.5x) compared to previous attention mechanisms while maintaining model performance. This approach is particularly relevant for hardware optimization, as it reduces KV cache IO and enhances GPU utilization.\n\n- **Cerberus** is another framework that incorporates adaptive parallel decoding, which includes tree-based decoding heads. Cerberus integrates sequential knowledge and uses a gating mechanism to optimize inference speed. It demonstrates improved performance and efficiency in various downstream tasks, especially in tree-based workloads, highlighting its potential for hardware-aware implementation.\n\n## Integration of Geometric Priors in Neural Architectures\n\n- The work on **LatFormer** is notable for incorporating lattice symmetry priors in attention mechanisms. This approach improves sample efficiency by requiring significantly fewer data points than standard attention mechanisms. The use of geometric priors guides attention patterns and enhances the model's ability to reason abstractly, which could be beneficial for integrating geometric structures in hierarchical relationships.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Sparse Attention Patterns\n\n- **DeFT** also addresses the issue of sparse attention patterns by optimizing memory access and reducing the number of read/write operations for KV cache during attention calculation. The method of KV-Guided Grouping and Flattened Tree KV Splitting ensures efficient distribution of the KV cache, enhancing GPU utilization and reducing computational redundancy.\n\n- The general guide to advances in deep learning efficiency highlights the importance of optimizing Transformer components, including the attention mechanism. It discusses the use of tensor cores for fast matrix multiplication and the need for efficient memory management, which aligns with the goal of implementing hardware-aware sparse attention patterns.\n\n## Summary\n\n- **Tree-Based Attention**: DeFT and Cerberus provide promising approaches to tree-based attention mechanisms, with DeFT focusing on optimizing memory access and Cerberus on adaptive parallel decoding.\n- **Geometric Priors**: LatFormer's use of lattice symmetry priors offers a way to integrate geometric structures into attention mechanisms, improving sample efficiency.\n- **Hardware-Optimized Sparse Attention**: DeFT's techniques for optimizing KV cache and memory access, along with the broader context of deep learning efficiency improvements, are crucial for implementing hardware-aware sparse attention patterns.\n\nThese findings should help in designing an autoregressive language model that is efficient, scalable, and optimized for both performance and hardware utilization.\n",

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention. The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/24 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07289, 2015.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Tree ensemble kernels for Bayesian optimization with known constraints over mixed-feature spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Alexander Thebelt, Calvin Tsay, Robert M. Lee, Nathan Sudermann-Merx, D. Walz, B. Shafei, R. Misener*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes using the kernel interpretation of tree ensembles as a Gaussian Process prior to obtain model variance estimates, and develops a compatible optimization formulation for the acquisition function.\n\n**Abstract:** Tree ensembles can be well-suited for black-box optimization tasks such as algorithm tuning and neural architecture search, as they achieve good predictive performance with little or no manual tuning, naturally handle discrete feature spaces, and are relatively insensitive to outliers in the training data. Two well-known challenges in using tree ensembles for black-box optimization are (i) effectively quantifying model uncertainty for exploration and (ii) optimizing over the piece-wise constant acquisition function. To address both points simultaneously, we propose using the kernel interpretation of tree ensembles as a Gaussian Process prior to obtain model variance estimates, and we develop a compatible optimization formulation for the acquisition function. The latter further allows us to seamlessly integrate known constraints to improve sampling efficiency by considering domain-knowledge in engineering settings and modeling search space symmetries, e.g., hierarchical relationships in neural architecture search. Our framework performs as well as state-of-the-art methods for unconstrained black-box optimization over continuous/discrete features and outperforms competing methods for problems combining mixed-variable feature spaces and known input constraints.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Multi-Layer Feature Reduction for Tree Structured Group Lasso via Hierarchical Projection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Jie Wang, Jieping Ye*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel Multi-Layer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response.\n\n**Abstract:** Tree structured group Lasso (TGL) is a powerful technique in uncovering the tree structured sparsity over the features, where each node encodes a group of features. It has been applied successfully in many real-world applications. However, with extremely large feature dimensions, solving TGL remains a significant challenge due to its highly complicated regularizer. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Layer Feature reduction method (MLFre) to quickly identify the inactive nodes (the groups of features with zero coefficients in the solution) hierarchically in a top-down fashion, which are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the response. Thus, we can remove the detected nodes from the optimization without sacrificing accuracy. The major challenge in developing such testing rules is due to the overlaps between the parents and their children nodes. By a novel hierarchical projection algorithm, MLFre is able to test the nodes independently from any of their ancestor nodes. Moreover, we can integrate MLFre\u2014that has a low computational cost\u2014with any existing solvers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets demonstrate that the speedup gained by MLFre can be orders of magnitude.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Channel-spatial Encoding for Communication-efficient Collaborative Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Qihua Zhou, Song Guo, Yi Liu, J. Zhang, Jiewei Zhang, Tao Guo, Zhenda Xu, Xun Liu, Zhihao Qu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper takes new insights into implementing scalable CL systems through a hierarchical compression on features, termed Stripe-wise Group Quantization (SGQ), which achieves a higher traffic reduction ratio and provides 9 .\n\n**Abstract:** It witnesses that the collaborative learning (CL) systems often face the performance bottleneck of limited bandwidth, where multiple low-end devices continuously generate data and transmit intermediate features to the cloud for incremental training. To this end, improving the communication efficiency by reducing traffic size is one of the most crucial issues for realistic deployment. Existing systems mostly compress features at pixel level and ignore the characteristics of feature structure, which could be further exploited for more efficient compression. In this paper, we take new insights into implementing scalable CL systems through a hierarchical compression on features, termed Stripe-wise Group Quantization (SGQ). Different from previous unstructured quantization methods, SGQ captures both channel and spatial similarity in pixels, and simultaneously encodes features in these two levels to gain a much higher compression ratio. In particular, we refactor feature structure based on inter-channel similarity and bound the gradient deviation caused by quantization, in forward and backward passes, respectively. Such a double-stage pipeline makes SGQ hold a sublinear convergence order as the vanilla SGD-based optimization. Extensive experiments show that SGQ achieves a higher traffic reduction ratio by up to 15 . 97 \u00d7 and provides 9 . 22 \u00d7 image processing speedup over the uniform quantized training, while preserving adequate model accuracy as FP32 does, even using 4-bit quantization. This verifies that SGQ can be applied to a wide spectrum of edge intelligence applications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Dense RGB SLAM with Neural Implicit Maps\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Heng Li, Xiaodong Gu, Weihao Yuan, Luwei Yang, Zilong Dong, Ping Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a photometric warping loss in the spirit of multi-view stereo to better constrain the camera pose and scene geometry and introduces a hierarchical feature volume to facilitate the implicit map decoder.\n\n**Abstract:** There is an emerging trend of using neural implicit functions for map representation in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Some pioneer works have achieved encouraging results on RGB-D SLAM. In this paper, we present a dense RGB SLAM method with neural implicit map representation. To reach this challenging goal without depth input, we introduce a hierarchical feature volume to facilitate the implicit map decoder. This design effectively fuses shape cues across different scales to facilitate map reconstruction. Our method simultaneously solves the camera motion and the neural implicit map by matching the rendered and input video frames. To facilitate optimization, we further propose a photometric warping loss in the spirit of multi-view stereo to better constrain the camera pose and scene geometry. We evaluate our method on commonly used benchmarks and compare it with modern RGB and RGB-D SLAM systems. Our method achieves favorable results than previous methods and even surpasses some recent RGB-D SLAM methods.The code is at poptree.github.io/DIM-SLAM/.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. fVDB: A Deep-Learning Framework for Sparse, Large-Scale, and High-Performance Spatial Intelligence\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Ken Museth, Eftychios Sifakis, Sanja Fidler, Clement Fuji-Tsang, RuiLong Li, Xuanchi Ren, Matthew Cong, Vijay Thakkar, Gergely Kl\u00e1r, Jonathan Swartz, Jiahui Huang, Francis Williams*\n\n**Abstract:** We present fVDB, a novel GPU-optimized framework for deep learning on large-scale 3D data. fVDB provides a complete set of differentiable primitives to build deep learning architectures for common tasks in 3D learning such as convolution, pooling, attention, ray-tracing, meshing, etc. fVDB simultaneously provides a much larger feature set (primitives and operators) than established frameworks with no loss in efficiency: our operators match or exceed the performance of other frameworks with narrower scope. Furthermore, fVDB can process datasets with much larger footprint and spatial resolution than prior works, while providing a competitive memory footprint on small inputs. To achieve this combination of versatility and performance, fVDB relies on a single novel VDB index grid acceleration structure paired with several key innovations including GPU accelerated sparse grid construction, convolution using tensorcores, fast ray tracing kernels using a Hierarchical Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm (HDDA), and jagged tensors. Our framework is fully integrated with PyTorch enabling interoperability with existing pipelines, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on a number of representative tasks such as large-scale point-cloud segmentation, high resolution 3D generative modeling, unbounded scale Neural Radiance Fields, and large-scale point cloud reconstruction.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Deep Patch Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Classification and Discovery\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Peng Tang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang, Zilong Huang, Xiang Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** Patch-level image representation is very important for object classification\nand detection, since it is robust to spatial transformation, scale variation,\nand cluttered background. Many existing methods usually require fine-grained\nsupervisions (e.g., bounding-box annotations) to learn patch features, which\nrequires a great effort to label images may limit their potential applications.\nIn this paper, we propose to learn patch features via weak supervisions, i.e.,\nonly image-level supervisions. To achieve this goal, we treat images as bags\nand patches as instances to integrate the weakly supervised multiple instance\nlearning constraints into deep neural networks. Also, our method integrates the\ntraditional multiple stages of weakly supervised object classification and\ndiscovery into a unified deep convolutional neural network and optimizes the\nnetwork in an end-to-end way. The network processes the two tasks object\nclassification and discovery jointly, and shares hierarchical deep features.\nThrough this jointly learning strategy, weakly supervised object classification\nand discovery are beneficial to each other. We test the proposed method on the\nchallenging PASCAL VOC datasets. The results show that our method can obtain\nstate-of-the-art performance on object classification, and very competitive\nresults on object discovery, with faster testing speed than competitors.\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multi-stage Factorized Spatio-Temporal Representation for RGB-D Action and Gesture Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical feature integration scale optimization*\n\n*Pichao Wang, Ruili Wang, Benjia Zhou, Yujun Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** RGB-D action and gesture recognition remain an interesting topic in human-centered scene understanding, primarily due to the multiple granularities and large variation in human motion. Although many RGB-D based action and gesture recognition approaches have demonstrated remarkable results by utilizing highly integrated spatio-temporal representations across multiple modalities (i.e., RGB and depth data), they still encounter several challenges. Firstly, vanilla 3D convolution makes it hard to capture fine-grained motion differences between local clips under different modalities. Secondly, the intricate nature of highly integrated spatio-temporal modeling can lead to optimization difficulties. Thirdly, duplicate and unnecessary information can add complexity and complicate entangled spatio-temporal modeling. To address the above issues, we propose an innovative heuristic architecture called Multi-stage Factorized Spatio-Temporal (MFST) for RGB-D action and gesture recognition. The proposed MFST model comprises a 3D Central Difference Convolution Stem (CDC-Stem) module and multiple factorized spatio-temporal stages. The CDC-Stem enriches fine-grained temporal perception, and the multiple hierarchical spatio-temporal stages construct dimension-independent higher-order semantic primitives. Specifically, the CDC-Stem module captures bottom-level spatio-temporal features and passes them successively to the following spatio-temporal factored stages to capture the hierarchical spatial and temporal features through the Multi- Scale Convolution and Transformer (MSC-Trans) hybrid block and Weight-shared Multi-Scale Transformer (WMS-Trans) block. The seamless integration of these innovative designs results in a robust spatio-temporal representation that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on RGB-D action and gesture recognition datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on hierarchical feature integration and scale-specific optimization, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n### Hierarchical Feature Integration in Transformers\n\n#### Multi-scale Feature Fusion\n- The Swin Transformer model is a notable example of hierarchical feature integration. It constructs hierarchical feature maps by merging smaller patches in deeper layers, which is effective for tasks requiring detailed spatial understanding. This approach can be adapted to language models by processing input sequences at multiple scales, similar to how Swin Transformer handles image patches.\n- The QKFormer model, although focused on spiking neural networks, introduces a hierarchical structure with a different number of tokens across blocks. This multi-scale spiking representation can be a inspiration for designing hierarchical feature fusion in language models, ensuring that different scales of input are effectively integrated.\n\n#### Scale-aware Attention\n- The concept of scale-aware attention can be derived from models like the Swin Transformer, which computes attention within local windows and shifts these windows between layers. For language models, this could translate to attention mechanisms that adaptively focus on different scales of the input sequence, ensuring that both local and global context are captured efficiently.\n- The Hierarchical Transformer-Gated Network mentioned in a tweet discusses a Global-Local Gating Module, which dynamically controls the flow between locally extracted features and globally attended representations. This adaptive gating mechanism can be a valuable component in designing scale-aware attention for language models.\n\n#### Memory-efficient Integration\n- The MHCFIN (Multi-Hierarchical Complementary Feature Interaction Network) model uses a dual-branch encoder-decoder structure with multi-attention mechanisms and residual learning to reduce information loss. This approach can be applied to language models to ensure memory-efficient integration of features at different scales. The use of residual connections and multi-attention mechanisms can help in capturing key features while minimizing computational overhead.\n\n### Scale-specific Optimization\n\n#### Adaptive Scale Selection\n- The Swin Transformer's approach of merging patches in deeper layers can be seen as an adaptive scale selection mechanism. For language models, this could involve dynamically adjusting the scale at which different parts of the input sequence are processed, based on the context and relevance of the information.\n- The Hierarchical Transformer-Gated Network's adaptive gating mechanism can also be seen as a form of adaptive scale selection, where the model dynamically decides the importance of local versus global features.\n\n#### Scale-aware Compression\n- Efficient scale management can be achieved through techniques like those used in the QKFormer model, which employs a novel spike-form Q-K attention module that enables efficient modeling of token or channel attention through binary vectors. This can be adapted to language models to achieve scale-aware compression, reducing the computational and memory requirements while maintaining performance.\n\n#### Efficient Scale Management\n- The MHCFIN model's use of dual cross-attention at the decoder to achieve complementary knowledge transfer across modalities can be applied to language models. This ensures that features at different scales are integrated efficiently, reducing the overall computational complexity.\n- IO-aware algorithms and tiling and caching strategies, as mentioned in the analysis note, are crucial for efficient scale management. These techniques can significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve performance, especially in hardware-aware designs[Analysis Note].\n\n#### Memory-Bandwidth Optimization\n- The analysis note highlights the importance of memory-bandwidth optimization through techniques like tiling, caching, and dynamic pruning. These strategies can be applied to language models to ensure that the integration of features at different scales is done in a memory-efficient manner, optimizing both memory usage and model performance[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hardware Optimization\n\n- Hardware-aware implementations, as emphasized in the analysis note, are crucial for real performance gains. Techniques such as selective KV pair retention, cache utilization strategies, and hardware-aware designs can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of the model[Analysis Note].\n- The QKFormer model's focus on linear complexity and high energy efficiency through its novel spike-form Q-K attention module is another example of how hardware optimization can be achieved in hierarchical models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can design an autoregressive language model that efficiently handles hierarchical feature integration, optimizes scale-specific processing, and ensures hardware-efficient implementation, ultimately leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

Score: 0.68)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/48 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nJayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer linear attention test-time training*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 560  (*Influential: 82*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using hierarchical transformer architectures, linear attention mechanisms, and test-time training, here are some key points and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Hierarchical Transformer Architectures\n\n### Multi-scale Feature Processing\n- The Swin Transformer is a notable example of a hierarchical transformer architecture that processes data at multiple scales, which is effective for tasks requiring both local and global context understanding. This approach can be adapted for language models to handle different levels of granularity in text data.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Implementations\n- Techniques such as model pruning, knowledge distillation, and efficient attention mechanisms (like linear attention or multi-query attention) are crucial for making large transformer models more memory-efficient. These methods can be integrated into hierarchical architectures to reduce computational requirements and memory usage.\n\n### Scale Integration Techniques\n- Hybrid models that combine CNNs and transformers have shown success in computer vision by leveraging the strengths of both architectures. Similarly, in language models, integrating hierarchical processing with different scales of feature extraction can enhance performance. For example, using hierarchical attention patterns can help in capturing both local and global context.\n\n### Sparse Attention Patterns\n- Sparse attention mechanisms, where the model only attends to a subset of the input at each layer, are effective in handling long sequences and reducing computational complexity. This approach can be particularly useful in hierarchical models to maintain efficiency while processing multi-scale features.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Achieving Sub-Quadratic Complexity\n- Linear attention mechanisms are designed to reduce the computational complexity of attention from quadratic to linear, making them more efficient for long sequences. These mechanisms can be integrated with hierarchical processing to maintain model expressiveness while reducing computational overhead.\n\n### Maintaining Model Expressiveness\n- Linear attention methods, such as those using kernel-based approximations, can maintain the expressiveness of the model while achieving linear complexity. This is crucial for ensuring that the hierarchical model does not lose its ability to capture complex relationships in the data.\n\n### Supporting Causal Masking\n- Linear attention mechanisms can be designed to support causal masking, which is essential for autoregressive language models to prevent the model from attending to future tokens during generation. This ensures that the model generates text sequentially without violating the causal structure.\n\n### Integration with Hierarchical Processing\n- Combining linear attention with hierarchical processing can enhance the model's ability to handle multi-scale features efficiently. This integration allows the model to capture both local and global context while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n## Test-Time Training Approaches\n\n### Compatibility with Hierarchical Processing\n- Test-time training approaches need to be compatible with hierarchical models to adapt efficiently across different scales. Techniques such as input-dependent state updates and selective state space models can be adapted for hierarchical architectures to ensure efficient processing during test-time training.\n\n### Efficiency of Adaptation Across Scales\n- Efficient adaptation across scales can be achieved by using hierarchical attention patterns and sparse attention mechanisms. These methods allow the model to adapt to new data efficiently while managing memory and computational resources effectively.\n\n### Memory Management During Adaptation\n- Memory management during test-time training is crucial, especially for hierarchical models. Techniques like model pruning and knowledge distillation can be applied to reduce the model's size and memory requirements without significantly impacting performance.\n\n### Support for Long Sequences\n- Test-time training approaches should be able to handle long sequences efficiently. Using relative positional encoding and sparse attention mechanisms can help in this regard, enabling the model to generalize better to sequences of varying lengths.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- The LiGAR framework, although focused on multi-modal group activity recognition, demonstrates the use of hierarchical transformers with multi-scale processing. This concept can be applied to language models to enhance their ability to handle complex and varied input data.\n\n- The integration of multiple pre-trained networks and multi-scale feature fusion, as seen in the multi-stream CNN framework, can provide insights into how to fuse features from different scales efficiently in hierarchical transformer models.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, the researcher can design an autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical processing, linear attention mechanisms, and efficient test-time training, thereby improving its performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.12)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Attention as an RNN (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Y. Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/34 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nLin, T., Wang, Y., Liu, X., and Qiu, X.

GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Green Hierarchical Vision Transformer for Masked Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Lang Huang, Shan You, Mingkai Zheng, Fei Wang, Chen Qian, T. Yamasaki*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient approach for Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with hierarchical Vision Transformers (ViTs), allowing the hierarchical ViTs to discard masked patches and operate only on the visible ones. Our approach consists of three key designs. First, for window attention, we propose a Group Window Attention scheme following the Divide-and-Conquer strategy. To mitigate the quadratic complexity of the self-attention w.r.t. the number of patches, group attention encourages a uniform partition that visible patches within each local window of arbitrary size can be grouped with equal size, where masked self-attention is then performed within each group. Second, we further improve the grouping strategy via the Dynamic Programming algorithm to minimize the overall computation cost of the attention on the grouped patches. Third, as for the convolution layers, we convert them to the Sparse Convolution that works seamlessly with the sparse data, i.e., the visible patches in MIM. As a result, MIM can now work on most, if not all, hierarchical ViTs in a green and efficient way. For example, we can train the hierarchical ViTs, e.g., Swin Transformer and Twins Transformer, about 2.7$\\times$ faster and reduce the GPU memory usage by 70%, while still enjoying competitive performance on ImageNet classification and the superiority on downstream COCO object detection benchmarks.

Nevertheless, applying them in industrial production requires tedious and heavy works to reduce inference costs. To fill such a gap, we introduce a scalable inference solution: Easy and Efficient Transformer (EET), including a series of transformer inference optimization at the algorithm and implementation levels. First, we design highly optimized kernels for long inputs and large hidden sizes. Second, we propose a flexible CUDA memory manager to reduce the memory footprint when deploying a large model.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Tree Methods for Hierarchical Classification in Parallel\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Franz A.

Our methods transform a batch of classification scores and labels, corresponding to given nodes in a semantic tree, to scores and labels corresponding to all nodes in the ancestral paths going down the tree to every given node, relying only on tensor operations that execute efficiently on hardware accelerators. We implement our methods and test them on current hardware accelerators with a tree incorporating all English-language synsets in WordNet 3.0, spanning 117,659 classes in 20 levels of depth. We transform batches of scores and labels to their respective ancestral paths, incurring negligible computation and consuming only a fixed 0.04GB of memory over the footprint of data.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality. Future research involving vision or speech could further substantiate the robustness of our method. ## E Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents SPARSEK Attention, whose goal is to address both computational and memory efficiency challenges in long-range Transformer computing. We believe our innovative attention mechanism can benefit both NLP and machine learning communities in constructing long-range foundation models. Specifically, we highlight the potential impacts of SPARSEK as follows:\n\n- Efficient Long-Range Modeling. First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. By prioritizing a subset of key-value pairs, SPARSEK attention effectively reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model performance.\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.58)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

Score: 0.17)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns test-time training memory management*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns test-time training memory management*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Computationally Efficient Sparsified Online Newton Method\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention patterns test-time training memory management*\n\n*Fnu Devvrit, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Rohan Anil, Vineet Gupta, Cho-Jui Hsieh, I. Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method is introduced, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner that is as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order methods hold significant promise for enhancing the convergence of deep neural network training; however, their large memory and computational demands have limited their practicality. Thus there is a need for scalable second-order methods that can efficiently train large models. In this paper, we introduce the Sparsified Online Newton (SONew) method, a memory-efficient second-order algorithm that yields a sparsified yet effective preconditioner. The algorithm emerges from a novel use of the LogDet matrix divergence measure; we combine it with sparsity constraints to minimize regret in the online convex optimization framework. Empirically, we test our method on large scale benchmarks of up to 1B parameters. We achieve up to 30% faster convergence, 3.4% relative improvement in validation performance, and 80% relative improvement in training loss, in comparison to memory efficient optimizers including first order methods. Powering the method is a surprising fact -- imposing structured sparsity patterns, like tridiagonal and banded structure, requires little to no overhead, making it as efficient and parallelizable as first-order methods. In wall-clock time, tridiagonal SONew is only about 3% slower per step than first-order methods but gives overall gains due to much faster convergence. In contrast, one of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) memory-intensive second-order methods, Shampoo, is unable to scale to large benchmarks. Additionally, while Shampoo necessitates significant engineering efforts to scale to large benchmarks, SONew offers a more straightforward implementation, increasing its practical appeal. SONew code is available at: https://github.com/devvrit/SONew\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention patterns, test-time training, and memory-efficient state management, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Sparse Attention Patterns\n\n### Implementation Techniques\n- **SeerAttention**: This method introduces a learnable gate to adaptively identify important blocks in the attention map, allowing for dynamic sparsity that outperforms static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods. It achieves significant speedup with minimal perplexity loss, especially in long-context fine-tuning.\n- **Heterogeneous Context Sharding**: This approach involves sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. This method ensures high parallelization and optimized memory IO, and it is particularly beneficial when combined with hybrid architectures of sparse and dense attention.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n- **Sparse Self-Attention**: Reduces computational complexity by attending to only a subset of tokens. Techniques like factorizing attention computation into local and stride patterns, or using sliding window attention, can significantly reduce the computational cost.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining sparse and dense attention can balance efficiency and performance. For example, using sparse attention for most layers and dense attention at certain layers ensures access to all tokens, which is crucial for strong performance on long-context tasks.\n\n### Performance Impact\n- **SeerAttention** and **Heterogeneous Context Sharding** both demonstrate strong performance on downstream tasks while achieving significant speedups. SeerAttention can maintain performance with up to 90% sparsity ratio, and heterogeneous context sharding achieves performance on-par with full attention.\n\n### Hardware Optimization\n- **Hardware-Aware Designs**: Ensuring that sparse attention patterns are compatible with accelerator parallelization and efficient memory access patterns is crucial. For instance, the S2-Attention kernel facilitates efficient implementation of heterogeneous context sharding, leading to substantial speedups.\n\n## Test-Time Training in Hierarchical Models\n\n### Memory Management\n- **Dynamic Pruning**: During test-time training, dynamic pruning can help reduce memory usage while maintaining performance. This involves adaptively pruning less important weights or attention heads based on the input context[Analysis Note].\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Algorithms like FlashAttention, which use tiling to reduce memory reads/writes, can be adapted for test-time training to improve efficiency.\n\n### State Updates\n- **Adaptive State Updates**: Implementing adaptive state updates that adjust based on the input context can help in efficient test-time training. This might involve updating only the most relevant parts of the model state[Analysis Note].\n\n### Adaptation Strategies\n- **Fine-Tuning with Sparse Attention**: Methods like SeerAttention can be applied during fine-tuning to adapt the model to new contexts efficiently. This involves learning intrinsic sparse attention patterns that can adapt to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios.\n\n### Efficiency Considerations\n- **Cache Utilization**: Strategies that optimize cache utilization, such as tiling and caching, can significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements during test-time training.\n- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Optimizing memory bandwidth is key for scaling test-time training. This can be achieved through hardware-aware designs and efficient data access patterns[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Management\n\n### Caching Strategies\n- **Tiling and Caching**: Using tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM can significantly improve efficiency. This is demonstrated in algorithms like FlashAttention.\n\n### State Compression\n- **Scale-Specific Compression**: Implementing compression techniques that are scale-specific can help in reducing memory usage. For example, hierarchical matrix structures can reduce memory complexity linearly[Analysis Note].\n\n### Bandwidth Optimization\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Algorithms designed with IO-awareness can optimize memory bandwidth usage. This includes techniques like heterogeneous context sharding and sparse attention that reduce the need for full attention computations.\n\n### Hardware Utilization\n- **Hardware-Friendly Designs**: Ensuring that the model design is compatible with hardware constraints is crucial. For instance, using sparse attention patterns that are optimized for parallelization and efficient memory access can lead to significant performance gains.\n\nIn summary, the key to improving autoregressive language models lies in:\n\n- **Implementing dynamic and adaptive sparse attention mechanisms** like SeerAttention and heterogeneous context sharding to balance efficiency and performance.\n- **Optimizing memory management** through IO-aware algorithms, dynamic pruning, and efficient caching strategies.\n- **Utilizing hardware-aware designs** to ensure that the model can leverage hardware capabilities effectively, leading to real-world efficiency gains.\n- **Adapting state updates and compression techniques** to reduce memory usage while maintaining performance during test-time training.\n\nThese strategies can help in achieving better overall performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",
