Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 2. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical neural architectures memory compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

Adya, Mohammad Rastegari*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression and demonstrates that DKM delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural network (DNN) model compression for efficient on-device inference is becoming increasingly important to reduce memory requirements and keep user data on-device. To this end, we propose a novel differentiable k-means clustering layer (DKM) and its application to train-time weight clustering-based DNN model compression. DKM casts k-means clustering as an attention problem and enables joint optimization of the DNN parameters and clustering centroids. Unlike prior works that rely on additional regularizers and parameters, DKM-based compression keeps the original loss function and model architecture fixed. We evaluated DKM-based compression on various DNN models for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Our results demonstrate that DKM delivers superior compression and accuracy trade-off on ImageNet1k and GLUE benchmarks. For example, DKM-based compression can offer 74.5% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy on ResNet50 DNN model with 3.3MB model size (29.4x model compression factor). For MobileNet-v1, which is a challenging DNN to compress, DKM delivers 63.9% top-1 ImageNet1k accuracy with 0.72 MB model size (22.4x model compression factor). This result is 6.8% higher top-1accuracy and 33% relatively smaller model size than the current state-of-the-art DNN compression algorithms. Additionally, DKM enables compression of DistilBERT model by 11.8x with minimal (1.1%) accuracy loss on GLUE NLP benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3.

Mahoney, Alvin Cheung*\n\n**TL;DR:** GACT, an ACT framework to support a broad range of machine learning tasks for generic NN architectures with limited domain knowledge is presented, and the convergence of GACT is proved by analyzing a linearized version of ACT's approximate gradient.\n\n**Abstract:** Training large neural network (NN) models requires extensive memory resources, and Activation Compressed Training (ACT) is a promising approach to reduce training memory footprint. This paper presents GACT, an ACT framework to support a broad range of machine learning tasks for generic NN architectures with limited domain knowledge. By analyzing a linearized version of ACT's approximate gradient, we prove the convergence of GACT without prior knowledge on operator type or model architecture. To make training stable, we propose an algorithm that decides the compression ratio for each tensor by estimating its impact on the gradient at run time. We implement GACT as a PyTorch library that readily applies to any NN architecture. GACT reduces the activation memory for convolutional NNs, transformers, and graph NNs by up to 8.1x, enabling training with a 4.2x to 24.7x larger batch size, with negligible accuracy loss.

Improving Inference for Neural Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical neural architectures memory compression*\n\n*Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, S. Mandt*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies three approximation gaps which limit performance in the conventional approach to compression and proposes improvements to each based on ideas related to iterative inference, stochastic annealing for discrete optimization, and bits-back coding, resulting in the first application of bits- back coding to lossy compression.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of lossy image compression with deep latent variable models. State-of-the-art methods build on hierarchical variational autoencoders (VAEs) and learn inference networks to predict a compressible latent representation of each data point. Drawing on the variational inference perspective on compression, we identify three approximation gaps which limit performance in the conventional approach: (i) an amortization gap, (ii) a discretization gap, and (iii) a marginalization gap. We propose improvements to each of these three shortcomings based on ideas related to iterative inference, stochastic annealing for discrete optimization, and bits-back coding, resulting in the first application of bits-back coding to lossy compression. In our experiments, which include extensive baseline comparisons and ablation studies, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on lossy image compression using an established VAE architecture, by changing only the inference method.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical neural architectures memory compression*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical neural architectures, memory compression techniques, and integration with attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Hierarchical Neural Architectures\n\n### Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (HRNN)\nHRNNs are particularly useful for decomposing hierarchical behavior into subprograms. They connect neurons in various ways to leverage information from higher levels to enhance lower-level predictions. This hierarchical structure can help in managing long-range dependencies and optimizing memory usage. For example, HRNNs have been used in forecasting tasks, such as predicting inflation components, by utilizing information from higher levels in the hierarchy.\n\n### Multiple Timescales Recurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN)\nMTRNNs simulate the functional hierarchy of the brain by segmenting continuous sequences into reusable primitives. This model integrates neuronal activities with distinct time properties, allowing for flexible integration of sequential behaviors. This hierarchical approach can be beneficial for capturing global context and managing long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\nModels like the Hi-Transformer learn representations in a hierarchical manner, first at the sentence level and then at the document level. This approach reduces complexity while maintaining performance, which is crucial for handling long documents and sequences. It demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-scale processing in enhancing both efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques\n\n### Context Compression\nAutoCompressors can be used to extend the context window of language models while speeding up inference over long contexts. This involves compressing contexts into summary vectors, which is a simple and inexpensive solution for efficient handling of long sequences. Integrating such context compression techniques with existing architectures like FastTTTLinear could significantly improve memory efficiency[Analysis: \"Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts\"].\n\n### Neural History Compressor\nThe neural history compressor is an unsupervised stack of RNNs that learns to predict its next input from previous inputs. Only unpredictable inputs are passed to higher-level RNNs, which recomputes its internal state rarely. This approach minimizes the description length of the data and can be distilled into two RNNs: a \"conscious\" chunker and a \"subconscious\" automatizer. This hierarchical compression can help in optimizing memory usage by focusing on unpredictable events.\n\n## Efficient Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nResearch has shown that self-attention mechanisms do not necessarily require \\(O(n^2)\\) memory with respect to sequence length. Instead, algorithms can be designed to require \\(O(1)\\) or \\(O(\\log n)\\) memory, significantly reducing memory usage. These memory-efficient attention mechanisms can be integrated with hierarchical processing to achieve better performance without sacrificing model capacity[Analysis: \"Self-attention Does Not Need O(n^2) Memory\"].\n\n### Processing-in-Memory Architectures\nIn-memory computing (IMC) approaches, such as those using memristor technologies, can integrate computation and memory closely, reducing the latency and power associated with data movement. This can be particularly beneficial for matrix operations involved in attention mechanisms, as demonstrated by memristor-based accelerators for transformer networks.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nCombining hierarchical processing with memory-efficient attention mechanisms can yield significant improvements. For instance, hierarchical transformers can learn representations at multiple scales, and these can be integrated with efficient attention variants to manage long-range dependencies efficiently. This multi-scale processing can enhance both efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n### Context Compression and Attention\nContext compression techniques can be integrated with attention mechanisms to enhance test-time training and overall efficiency. By compressing contexts into summary vectors, the model can focus on relevant information while reducing the computational and memory requirements associated with long sequences[Analysis: \"Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts\"].\n\nBy leveraging these hierarchical neural architectures, memory compression techniques, and efficient attention mechanisms, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling long-range dependencies effectively.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.26)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Transformer-based LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023, Anil et al., 2023; Groeneveld et al. 2024) have a constrained context-dependent memory, due to the nature of the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism in Transformers exhibits quadratic complexity in both memory footprint and computation time. For example, the attention Key-Value (KV) states have 3TB memory footprint for a 500B model with batch size 512 and context length 2048 (Pope et al. 2023). Indeed, scaling LLMs to longer sequences (i.e. 1 M tokens) is challenging with the standard Transformer architectures and serving longer and longer context models becomes costly financially. Compressive memory systems promise to be more scalable and efficient than the attention mechanism for extremely long sequences (Kanerva, 1988; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Instead of using an array that grows with the input sequence length, a compressive memory primarily maintains a fixed number of parameters to store and recall information with a bounded storage and computation costs. In the compressive memory, new information is added to the memory by changing its parameters with an objective that this information can be recovered back later on. However, the LLMs in their current state have yet to see an effective, practical compressive memory technique that balances simplicity along with quality. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enables Transformer LLMs to effectively process infinitely long inputs with bounded memory footprint and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention (Figure 1). The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014, Vaswani et al. 2017) and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. Such a subtle but critical modification to the Transformer attention layer enables a natural extension of existing LLMs to infinitely long contexts via continual pre-training and finetuning. Our Infini-attention reuses all the key, value and query states of the standard attention computation for long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. We store old KV states of the attention in the compressive memory, instead of discarding them like in the standard attention mechanism. We then retrieve the values from the memory by using the attention query states when processing subsequent sequences. To compute the final contextual output, the Infini-attention aggregates the long-term memory-retrieved values and the local attention contexts. In our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms baseline models on longcontext language modeling benchmarks while having $114 x$ comprehension ratio in terms of memory size. The model achieves even better perplexity when trained with 100 K sequence length. A 1B LLM naturally scales to 1M sequence length and solves the passkey retrieval task when injected with Infini-attention. Finally, we show that a 8B model with Infiniattention reaches a new SOTA result on a 500 K length book summarization task after continual pre-training and task fine-tuning. In summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce a practical and yet powerful attention mechanism - Infini-attention with long-term compressive memory and local causal attention for efficiently modeling both long and short-range contextual dependencies. 2. Infini-attention introduces minimal change to the standard scaled dot-product attention and supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long-context adaptation by design. 3. Our approach enables Transformer LLMs to scale to infinitely long context with a bounded memory and compute resource by processing extremely long inputs in a streaming fashion. ## 2 Background\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process a single token $x_{t}$ at each step $t$ and computes a recurrent hidden state $h_{t}$ to represent an entire input sequence Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Maass et al. 2002):\n\n$$\nh_{t}=R N N\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe RNN computation is very efficient since the model maintains only a fixed-size vector $h_{t}$ for input sequence. However, for processing long sequences it becomes difficult to store entire contextual information into a single fixed-size vector and this limitation had implications on RNNs utility in certain tasks (Kaiser \\& Sutskever, 2015). To address the limitation, people extended the standard RNNs with an external memory component that can be read from and written to. One such an instance is Metalearned Neural Memory (MNM) (Munkhdalai et al., 2019):\n\n$$\nh_{t}, \\theta_{t}=M N M\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}, \\theta_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nMNM learns an additional memory state $\\theta$ parameterized by a feed-forward neural network (FFN) and uses query, key and value vectors (QKV) to interact with the memory, similar to the attention mechanism. To store information, it modifies the parameters of the FFN by using the key vectors as input and the value vectors for the target, and to read memory\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dbb8cf178811d16c1412g-03.jpg?height=663&width=1391&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 2: Infini-Transformer (top) has an entire context history whereas Transformer-XL (bottom) discards old contexts since it caches the KV states for the last segment only. entries, it forward-passes the query vectors through the memory FFN and retrieves its corresponding value. Like RNNs, the memory state is still bounded in MNM. Unlike the RNNs, the attention mechanism however doesn't maintain a recurrent state and only performs a feed-forward computation on input sequence segment $X_{s}$ :\n\n$$\nO_{s}=\\operatorname{attention}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe attention output $O_{s}$ is simply passed to the next layer and no state is carried over to the next input sequence $X_{s+1}$ at the same attention layer. In the attention layer, in order to capture the dependency between the consequent segments $X_{s}$ and $X_{s+1}$, one needs to process them altogether at the same time and this process becomes a bottleneck requiring large computational resources as the length of input sequence grows more and more. To improve the efficiency while still being able to benefit from the expressiveness of the attention mechanism, this work introduces a recurrent attention layer. ## 3 Method\n\nFigure 2 compares our model, Infini-Transformer, and Transformer-XL (Dai et al, 2019). Similar to Transformer-XL, Infini-Transformer operates on a sequence of segments. We compute the standard causal dot-product attention context within each segment. So the dot-product attention computation is local in a sense that it covers a total $N$ number of tokens of the current segment with index $S$ ( $N$ is the segment length). The local attention (Dai et al., 2019), however, discards the attention states of the previous segment when processing the next one. In Infini-Transformers, instead of leaving out the old KV attention states, we propose to reuse them to maintain the entire context history with a compressive memory. So each attention layer of Infini-Transformers has both global compressive and local fine-grained states. We call such an efficient attention mechanism Infini-attention, which is illustrated in Figure 1 and described formally in the following sections. ### 3.1 Infini-attention\n\nAs shown Figure 1, our Infini-attention is a recurrent attention mechanism that computes both local and global context states and combine them for its output. Similar to multi-head\nattention (MHA), it maintains $H$ number of parallel compressive memory per attention layer ( $H$ is the number of attention heads) in addition to the dot-product attention and like the RNNs and MNM, it maintains a recurrent memory state to efficiently track the long sequence context:\n\n$$\nO_{s}, M_{s}=\\text { infini-attention }\\left(X_{s}, M_{s-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.1.1 Scaled Dot-product Attention\n\nThe multi-head scaled dot-product attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), specially its self-attention variant (Munkhdalai et al., 2016. Cheng et al., 2016), has been the main building block in LLMs. The MHA's strong capability to model context-dependent dynamic computation and its conveniences of temporal masking have been leveraged extensively in the autoregressive generative models. A single head in the vanilla MHA computes its attention context $A_{\\text {dot }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from sequence of input segments $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ as follows. First, it computes attention query, key, and value states:\n\n$$\nK=X W_{K}, V=X W_{V} \\text { and } Q=X W_{Q} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nHere, $W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ and $W_{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ are trainable projection matrices. Then, the attention context is calculated as a weighted average of all other values as\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {dot }}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{\\text {model }}}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nFor MHA, we compute $H$ number of attention context vectors for each sequence element in parallel, concatenate them along the second dimension and then finally project the concatenated vector to the model space to obtain the attention output. ### 3.1.2 Compressive Memory\n\nIn Infini-attention, instead of computing new memory entries for compressive memory, we reuse the query, key and value states ( $Q, K$ and $V$ ) from the dot-product attention computation. The state sharing and reusing between the dot-product attention and compressive memory not only enables efficient plug-in-play long-context adaptation but also speeds up training and inference. Similar to the prior work (Munkhdalai et al., 2019), our goal is to store bindings of key and value states in the compressive memory and retrieve by using the query vectors. While there are different forms of compressive memory proposed in the literature (Hopfield, 1982; Kanerva, 1988; Schlag et al., 2019; Munkhdalai et al., 2019), for simplicity and computational efficiency, in this work we parameterize the memory with an associative matrix (Schlag et al., 2020). This approach further allows us to cast the memory update and retrieval process as linear attention mechanism (Shen et al., 2018) and to leverage stable training techniques from the related methods. Specially, we adopt the update rule and retrieval mechanism by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) mainly due to its simplicity and competitive performance. Memory retrieval. In Infini-attention, we retrieve new content $A_{\\text {mem }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from the memory $M_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ by using the query $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ as:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {mem }}=\\frac{\\sigma(Q) M_{s-1}}{\\sigma(Q) z_{s-1}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\sigma$ and $z_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }}}$ are a nonlinear activation function and a normalization term, respectively.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical attention mechanisms state compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 101  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 2. A Contextual Hierarchical Attention Network with Adaptive Objective for Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms state compression*\n\n*Yong Shan, Zekang Li, Jinchao Zhang, Fandong Meng, Yang Feng, Cheng Niu, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations, and proposes an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in dialogue state tracking (DST) leverage historical information to determine states which are generally represented as slot-value pairs. However, most of them have limitations to efficiently exploit relevant context due to the lack of a powerful mechanism for modeling interactions between the slot and the dialogue history. Besides, existing methods usually ignore the slot imbalance problem and treat all slots indiscriminately, which limits the learning of hard slots and eventually hurts overall performance. In this paper, we propose to enhance the DST through employing a contextual hierarchical attention network to not only discern relevant information at both word level and turn level but also learn contextual representations. We further propose an adaptive objective to alleviate the slot imbalance problem by dynamically adjust weights of different slots during training. Experimental results show that our approach reaches 52.68% and 58.55% joint accuracy on MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.1 datasets respectively and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with considerable improvements (+1.24% and +5.98%).\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical attention prototypical networks (HAPN) for few-shot text classification. We design the feature level, word level, and instance level multi cross attention for our model to enhance the expressive ability of semantic space, so it can highlight or weaken the importance of the features, words, and instances separately. We verify the effectiveness of our model on two standard benchmark few-shot text classification datasets\u2014FewRel and CSID, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The visualization of hierarchical attention layers illustrates that our model can capture more important features, words, and instances. In addition, our attention mechanism increases support set augmentability and accelerates convergence speed in the training stage.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4.

A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets.

TextHawk: Exploring Efficient Fine-Grained Perception of Multimodal Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms state compression*\n\n*Wei Zeng, Xiaoyu Zheng, Yongxin Liao, Jihao Wu, Minghui Liao, Ya-Qi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive results on various multimodal tasks. However, most existing MLLMs are not well suited for document-oriented tasks, which require fine-grained image perception and information compression. In this paper, we present TextHawk, a MLLM that is specifically designed for document-oriented tasks, while preserving the general capabilities of MLLMs. TextHawk is aimed to explore efficient fine-grained perception by designing four dedicated components. Firstly, a ReSampling and ReArrangement (ReSA) module is proposed to reduce the redundancy in the document texts and lower the computational cost of the MLLM. We explore encoding the positions of each local feature by presenting Scalable Positional Embeddings (SPEs), which can preserve the scalability of various image sizes. A Query Proposal Network (QPN) is then adopted to initialize the queries dynamically among different sub-images. To further enhance the fine-grained visual perceptual ability of the MLLM, we design a Multi-Level Cross-Attention (MLCA) mechanism that captures the hierarchical structure and semantic relations of document images. Furthermore, we create a new instruction-tuning dataset for document-oriented tasks by enriching the multimodal document data with Gemini Pro. We conduct extensive experiments on both general and document-oriented MLLM benchmarks, and show that TextHawk outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained document perception and general abilities.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks for Compressed Sensing Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms state compression*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have aroused great attention in Compressed\nSensing (CS) restoration. However, the working mechanism of DNNs is not\nexplainable, thereby it is unclear that how to design an optimal DNNs for CS\nrestoration. In this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework to explain\nDNNs, which proves that the hidden layers of DNNs are equivalent to Gibbs\ndistributions and interprets DNNs as a Bayesian hierarchical model. The\nframework provides a Bayesian perspective to explain the working mechanism of\nDNNs, namely some hidden layers learn a prior distribution and other layers\nlearn a likelihood distribution. Moreover, the framework provides insights into\nDNNs and reveals two inherent limitations of DNNs for CS restoration. In\ncontrast to most previous works designing an end-to-end DNNs for CS\nrestoration, we propose a novel DNNs to model a prior distribution only, which\ncan circumvent the limitations of DNNs. Given the prior distribution generated\nfrom the DNNs, we design a Bayesian inference algorithm to realize CS\nrestoration in the framework of Bayesian Compressed Sensing. Finally, extensive\nsimulations validate the proposed theory of DNNs and demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art CS restoration methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Att2CPC: Attention-Guided Lossy Attribute Compression of Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms state compression*\n\n*Manoranjan Paul, Pan Gao, Kang You, Kai Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** With the great progress of 3D sensing and acquisition technology, the volume of point cloud data has grown dramatically, which urges the development of efficient point cloud compression methods. In this paper, we focus on the task of learned lossy point cloud attribute compression (PCAC). We propose an efficient attention-based method for lossy compression of point cloud attributes leveraging on an autoencoder architecture. Specifically, at the encoding side, we conduct multiple downsampling to best exploit the local attribute patterns, in which effective External Cross Attention (ECA) is devised to hierarchically aggregate features by intergrating attributes and geometry contexts. At the decoding side, the attributes of the point cloud are progressively reconstructed based on the multi-scale representation and the zero-padding upsampling tactic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce attention mechanism to point-based lossy PCAC task. We verify the compression efficiency of our model on various sequences, including human body frames, sparse objects, and large-scale point cloud scenes. Experiments show that our method achieves an average improvement of 1.15 dB and 2.13 dB in BD-PSNR of Y channel and YUV channel, respectively, when comparing with the state-of-the-art point-based method Deep-PCAC. Codes of this paper are available at https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/Att2CPC.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention mechanisms, state compression, and efficient state management, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe DAAM introduced in the second source is a significant advancement in attention mechanisms. It employs a Gaussian-based modulation of input features, allowing the model to adaptively balance between broad and focused attention. This mechanism can be integrated into hierarchical models to enhance context understanding and efficiency.\n\n### Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)\nThe h-GNN model described in the first source uses a hierarchical structure with successive clustering and message-passing mechanisms. This approach can be adapted for language models by creating hierarchical representations of input sequences, allowing for more efficient and context-rich processing.\n\n### Graph-based Attention Block (GABIC)\nAlthough primarily designed for image compression, the GABIC method uses a graph-based attention mechanism that can be conceptually applied to language models. By reducing redundant features through a local graph-based attention, this approach could help in maintaining model expressiveness while reducing memory usage.\n\n## State Compression Techniques\n\n### Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA)\nLoMA, as mentioned in the analysis, enables lossless compression of the KV cache, which is crucial for reducing memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. This technique can be directly applied to hierarchical models to optimize memory usage[Analysis].\n\n### Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention\nThe Loki method suggests using low-rank approximations for key vectors, which can significantly reduce the dimensional space and thus the memory requirements. This technique can be integrated with hierarchical attention mechanisms to enhance efficiency[Analysis].\n\n## Integration of Compression with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Combining Hierarchical Structures with Compression\nThe HiNeRV model, which combines lightweight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings, demonstrates how multiple techniques can be integrated to improve efficiency. Similar approaches can be applied to language models by combining hierarchical attention mechanisms with state compression techniques like LoMA or low-rank approximations[Analysis].\n\n### Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\nThe DAAM mechanism can be integrated with compression techniques to ensure that the model focuses on the most pertinent features while maintaining a balanced attention distribution. This adaptability is crucial for handling both stationary and non-stationary data environments, which is common in language tasks.\n\n## Efficient State Management in Hierarchical Models\n\n### Hierarchical Clustering and Message Passing\nThe h-GNN model's use of successive clustering and message-passing mechanisms can be adapted for language models to manage state efficiently. By organizing input sequences into hierarchical levels, the model can preserve both local and global information, reducing the need for extensive memory storage.\n\n### Specialized Training Procedures\nThe analysis highlights the importance of specialized training procedures for efficient state management. Techniques such as those used in LoMA and Loki can be optimized through specific training methods that ensure the model maintains its expressiveness while reducing memory usage[Analysis].\n\n## Techniques for Maintaining Model Expressiveness\n\n### Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness\nThe DAAM mechanism and other adaptive attention methods ensure that the model does not overly focus on a few features but instead considers a broader array of information. This balance is crucial for maintaining model expressiveness while implementing compression and efficiency measures.\n\n### Hierarchical Encodings\nUsing hierarchical encodings, as seen in HiNeRV, can help in capturing long-range dependencies and maintaining model expressiveness even with compressed representations. This approach ensures that the model can handle complex tasks efficiently without losing contextual information[Analysis].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of memory usage but also maintain or even enhance their expressiveness and performance.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/21 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\n# DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models \n\nWei He ${ }^{*}$ Kai Han ${ }^{1}$ Yehui Tang ${ }^{1}$ Chengcheng Wang ${ }^{1}$ Yujie Yang ${ }^{1}$ Tianyu Guo ${ }^{1}$ Yunhe Wang ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture.\n```\n\n#### 2. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical state space models multi-scale processing\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical attention prototypical networks (HAPN) for few-shot text classification. We design the feature level, word level, and instance level multi cross attention for our model to enhance the expressive ability of semantic space, so it can highlight or weaken the importance of the features, words, and instances separately. We verify the effectiveness of our model on two standard benchmark few-shot text classification datasets\u2014FewRel and CSID, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The visualization of hierarchical attention layers illustrates that our model can capture more important features, words, and instances.

To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1497  (*Influential: 137*)\n\n#### 3.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient.

Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

Associating Objects with Transformers for Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models multi-scale processing*\n\n*Yi Yang, Yunchao Wei, Zongxin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding learning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under challenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to decode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple times computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can simultaneously process multiple objects' matching and segmentation decoding as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling multi-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for constructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT variant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our R50-AOT-L outperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (84.1% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (84.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.1%), while keeping more than $3\\times$ faster multi-object run-time. Meanwhile, our AOT-T can maintain real-time multi-object speed on the above benchmarks. Based on AOT, we ranked 1st in the 3rd Large-scale VOS Challenge.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models multi-scale processing*\n\n*Rose Yu, Yi-An Ma, Alessandro Vespignani, Matteo Chinazzi, Dongxia Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Science and engineering fields use computer simulation extensively. These simulations are often run at multiple levels of sophistication to balance accuracy and efficiency. Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling reduces the computational cost by fusing different simulation outputs. Cheap data generated from low-fidelity simulators can be combined with limited high-quality data generated by an expensive high-fidelity simulator. Existing methods based on Gaussian processes rely on strong assumptions of the kernel functions and can hardly scale to high-dimensional settings. We propose Multi-fidelity Hierarchical Neural Processes (MF-HNP), a unified neural latent variable model for multi-fidelity surrogate modeling. MF-HNP inherits the flexibility and scalability of Neural Processes. The latent variables transform the correlations among different fidelity levels from observations to latent space. The predictions across fidelities are conditionally independent given the latent states. It helps alleviate the error propagation issue in existing methods. MF-HNP is flexible enough to handle non-nested high dimensional data at different fidelity levels with varying input and output dimensions. We evaluate MF-HNP on epidemiology and climate modeling tasks, achieving competitive performance in terms of accuracy and uncertainty estimation. In contrast to deep Gaussian Processes with only low-dimensional (< 10) tasks, our method shows great promise for speeding up high-dimensional complex simulations (over 7000 for epidemiology modeling and 45000 for climate modeling).\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. MambaCSR: Dual-Interleaved Scanning for Compressed Image Super-Resolution With SSMs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models multi-scale processing*\n\n*Zhibo Chen, Shijie Zhao, Bingchen Li, Mengxi Guo, Xin Li, Yulin Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** We present MambaCSR, a simple but effective framework based on Mamba for the challenging compressed image super-resolution (CSR) task. Particularly, the scanning strategies of Mamba are crucial for effective contextual knowledge modeling in the restoration process despite it relying on selective state space modeling for all tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient dual-interleaved scanning paradigm (DIS) for CSR, which is composed of two scanning strategies: (i) hierarchical interleaved scanning is designed to comprehensively capture and utilize the most potential contextual information within an image by simultaneously taking advantage of the local window-based and sequential scanning methods; (ii) horizontal-to-vertical interleaved scanning is proposed to reduce the computational cost by leaving the redundancy between the scanning of different directions. To overcome the non-uniform compression artifacts, we also propose position-aligned cross-scale scanning to model multi-scale contextual information. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks have shown the great performance of our MambaCSR in the compressed image super-resolution task. The code will be soon available in~\\textcolor{magenta}{\\url{https://github.com/renyulin-f/MambaCSR}}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hierarchical state space models and multi-scale processing, here are some key points and techniques that can be considered based on the provided analysis and search results:\n\n## Methods for Combining State Space Models with Hierarchical Structures\n\n### Hierarchical Mamba Block (HMB)\nThe concept of the Hierarchical Mamba Block (HMB) from the Hi-Mamba network for image super-resolution can be adapted for language models. HMB combines a Local SSM (L-SSM) and a Region SSM (R-SSM) to aggregate multi-scale representations, enhancing context modeling ability. This hierarchical approach can be applied to language models by integrating local and regional state space models to capture both short-range and long-range dependencies.\n\n### State Space Duality and Selective State Space Models\nThe work on SC-MAMBA2 introduces the concept of State Space Duality (SSD) and selective state space models, which simplify the matrix transformations and improve adaptability and performance. These techniques can be integrated into hierarchical structures to enhance the efficiency and scalability of language models.\n\n## Techniques for Efficient Multi-Scale Feature Processing\n\n### Multi-Scale Fusion Mamba\nThe Multi-Scale Fusion Mamba (MF-Mamba) architecture, proposed for medical image processing, involves fusing features at multiple scales. This approach can be translated to language models by designing multi-scale fusion mechanisms that combine features from different layers or scales, improving the model's ability to capture diverse contextual information.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nHierarchical attention mechanisms, as suggested in the analysis, can be used to combine local and global attention. This approach allows the model to focus on different scales of context, from local to global, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of multi-scale feature processing.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Dense Connections in Hierarchical Models\n\n### Dense Connections in State Space Models\nThe \"DenseMamba\" concept involves integrating dense connections into state space models to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers. This technique retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output and maintains training parallelizability. Applying dense connections within a hierarchical structure can improve the information flow and efficiency of the model[Analysis].\n\n### Compressive Memory Systems\nCombining dense connections with compression techniques, such as Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA) or Infini-attention, can significantly reduce computational consumption and memory usage while maintaining information integrity. This integration can be particularly beneficial in hierarchical models where efficient memory management is crucial[Analysis].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Efficient Long-Sequence Processing\nTechniques like Infini-attention, which combines masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms, can be integrated into hierarchical state space models to enable efficient processing of long sequences. This approach ensures that both local and global contexts are effectively captured and processed[Analysis].\n\n### Scalability and Efficiency\nThe use of hierarchical state space models and multi-scale processing can be optimized further by leveraging low-rank approximations and other memory efficiency innovations. These methods can help in reducing the computational overhead and improving the scalability of the model, especially when dealing with large datasets and larger models[Analysis].\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical state space models and multi-scale processing to achieve better performance across various tasks.\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 2. Rethinking Attention with Performers (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*K.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/48 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nSmola, and Eduard H.

Universal Transformers  (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Mostafa Dehghani, Stephan Gouws, O. Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, Lukasz Kaiser*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2018)\t**Cited by** 673  (*Influential: 65*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses issues of parallelizability and global receptive field, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/32 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nJournal of Machine Learning Research, 15(1): $1929-1958,2014$.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

Matrix block size of $A_{i j}^{(0)}$, $A_{i j}^{(1)}$ and $A_{i j}^{(2)}$ is $2 \\times 2,4 \\times 4$ and $8 \\times 8$, respectively. Following the key insight into Multilevel Methods, we perform no approximation to any level-0 matrix block $A_{i j}^{(0)}$ and apply a low-rank approximation to off-diagonal matrix blocks in $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$. If we set the numerical rank of all these blocks to 2 , then we can assemble the three rank\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-05.jpg?height=327&width=764&top_left_y=202&top_left_x=1063)\n\nFigure 1: Token sequence partitions in three segment granularity. maps into a single rank map as 4\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-05.jpg?height=417&width=605&top_left_y=774&top_left_x=1114)\n\nThe hierarchical structure embodied by the predetermined rank map in Eq. (20) represents the inductive bias for the attention matrix $A$ in Eq. (16). But this construction step is inefficient because we need to form the original attention matrix and then perform SVD to discover the low-rank approximation. ### 5.2.2 Token Hierarchy\n\nTo illustrate the notion of token hierarchy, consider the same 16 -word sentence in Fig. 2. A simple 3-level binary-tree hierarchy can be set up by following the simple coarsening defined in Eq. (14): 1) At level-0, each one of the 16 words is mapped to its word embedding; 2) At level-1, each token (parent node) corresponds to a pair of adjacent words at level-0 (child nodes), which are shown inside each box. The embedding of each parent token is simply the average of its child token embeddings; 3) At level-2, each token (parent node) corresponds to one pair of adjacent tokens at level-1 (child nodes) or 4 adjacent words at level-0 (grand child nodes), which are shown inside each box. The embedding of each parent token is simply the average of its child token embeddings. In general, the height of the binary tree is $O\\left(\\log _{2}(L)\\right.$ and the total number of tree nodes is $O(2 L)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. We only need word embeddings for the leaf nodes since the\n\n[^2]embeddings of all other tree nodes can be recursively computed. The formal definition and notations of the recursion for query and key are detailed in section 6.1. ### 5.2.3 Informal Construction of Hierarchical Attention\n\nIt is clear from Fig. 2 that the embeddings of higher level tokens represent a coarser level representation of a larger chunk of the text. The tokens at different levels can be understood as multi-scale snapshots of the original token sequence at level-0. Hence this token hierarchy naturally induces a set of multi-scale attention matrices. Let $\\tilde{A}^{(i)}$ be the attention matrix induced by the tokens at level- $i$. It is clear from Fig. 2 that the size of $\\tilde{A}^{(0)}, \\tilde{A}^{(1)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$ is $16 \\times 16,8 \\times 8$ and $4 \\times 4$, respectively. This multi-scale viewpoint does not directly lead to a useful algorithm since matrix $\\tilde{A}^{(0)}$ contains all the information and there is little additional information from $\\tilde{A}^{(1)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$. A key step to arrive at the hierarchical attention is to apply the contextual sliding window at each hierarchy level. The tokens at each level are partitioned into segments of size 2 in Fig. 2. One way to implement the local attention is to allow each query token segment to attend only two adjacent key token segments, one to its left and another to its right. At level-0, each query token segment also attends to the collocated key token segment. The token segment partition and local attention lead to a tri-diagonal block sparse matrix structure for $\\tilde{A}^{(0)}$ and bi-diagonal block sparse matrix structure for $\\tilde{A}^{(1)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$. Their sparsity patterns are\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-06.jpg?height=409&width=610&top_left_y=1817&top_left_x=289)\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\tilde{A}^{(1)} \\propto\\left[\\begin{array}{l|l|l|l} \n& 2 & & \\\\\n\\hline 2 & & 2 & \\\\\n\\hline & 2 & & 2 \\\\\n\\hline & & 2 &\n\\end{array}\\right] \\\\\n\\tilde{A}^{(2)} \\propto\\left[\\begin{array}{l|l} \n& 2 \\\\\n\\hline 2 &\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere the 2 in the nonzero blocks indicates that these are dense blocks of size $2 \\times 2$. this sentence iis toillustrate how to setup token hierarchy leveliby level with aggregation\na) Level-0: 16 tokens partitioned into 8 segments\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-06.jpg?height=298&width=735&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=1072)\n\nFigure 2: A three-level token hierarchy. Dashed boxes represent segmentation and solid boxes represents tokens. It is clear that $\\tilde{A}^{(0)}$ is identical to $A^{(0)}$ in Eq. (19). The efficiency gain comes from $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(1)}$. Each nonzero entry in $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(1)}$ captures the aggregated or coarse attention between two disjoint chunk of four and two tokens, respectively. Progressively larger token chunks lead to progressively lower-precision approximation to the original attention blocks. This is precisely the intention of the rank map in Eq. (20). We can now see that $\\tilde{A}^{(2)}$ and $\\tilde{A}^{(1)}$ provide an efficient way to approximate $A^{(2)}$ in Eq. (17) and $A^{(1)}$ in Eq. (18), respectively. ## 6 Key Components in Hierarchical Attention\n\n### 6.1 Constructing Hierarchical Attention\n\nThe simple example in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 5. Attention with Bounded-memory Control (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Hao Peng, Jungo Kasai, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Zhaofeng Wu, Lingpeng Kong, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/39 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n4. \u00a7B. 2 presents a detailed derivation. Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical neural architectures memory efficiency multi-scale fusion\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Efficient Meta Neural Heuristic for Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical neural architectures memory efficiency multi-scale fusion*\n\n*Jinbiao Chen, Jiahai Wang, Zizhen Zhang, Zhiguang Cao, Te Ye, Siyuan Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems, which is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural heuristics based on deep reinforcement learning have exhibited promise in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). However, they are still struggling to achieve high learning efficiency and solution quality. To tackle this issue, we propose an efficient meta neural heuristic (EMNH), in which a meta-model is first trained and then fine-tuned with a few steps to solve corresponding single-objective subproblems. Specifically, for the training process, a (partial) architecture-shared multi-task model is leveraged to achieve parallel learning for the meta-model, so as to speed up the training; meanwhile, a scaled symmetric sampling method with respect to the weight vectors is designed to stabilize the training. For the fine-tuning process, an efficient hierarchical method is proposed to systematically tackle all the subproblems. Experimental results on the multi-objective traveling salesman problem (MOTSP), multi-objective capacitated vehicle routing problem (MOCVRP), and multi-objective knapsack problem (MOKP) show that, EMNH is able to outperform the state-of-the-art neural heuristics in terms of solution quality and learning efficiency, and yield competitive solutions to the strong traditional heuristics while consuming much shorter time.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Current training methods cannot simultaneously solve both training and inference dilemmas. This work proposes a novel Temporal Reversible architecture for SNNs (T-RevSNN) to jointly address the training and inference challenges by altering the forward propagation of SNNs. We turn off the temporal dynamics of most spiking neurons and design multi-level temporal reversible interactions at temporal turn-on spiking neurons, resulting in a $O(L)$ training memory. Combined with the temporal reversible nature, we redesign the input encoding and network organization of SNNs to achieve $O(1)$ inference energy cost. Then, we finely adjust the internal units and residual connections of the basic SNN block to ensure the effectiveness of sparse temporal information interaction. T-RevSNN achieves excellent accuracy on ImageNet, while the memory efficiency, training time acceleration, and inference energy efficiency can be significantly improved by $8.6 \\times$, $2.0 \\times$, and $1.6 \\times$, respectively. This work is expected to break the technical bottleneck of significantly increasing memory cost and training time for large-scale SNNs while maintaining high performance and low inference energy cost.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Ermi\u015f, Patrick Lewis, Sara Hooker*\n\n**TL;DR:** Goodtriever is introduced, a flexible methodology that matches the current state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while achieving 43% relative latency reduction during inference and being more computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Considerable effort has been dedicated to mitigating toxicity, but existing methods often require drastic modifications to model parameters or the use of computationally intensive auxiliary models. Furthermore, previous approaches have often neglected the crucial factor of language's evolving nature over time. In this work, we present a comprehensive perspective on toxicity mitigation that takes into account its changing nature. We introduce Goodtriever, a flexible methodology that matches the current state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while achieving 43% relative latency reduction during inference and being more computationally efficient. By incorporating a retrieval-based approach at decoding time, Goodtriever enables toxicity-controlled text generation. Our research advocates for an increased focus on adaptable mitigation techniques, which better reflect the data drift models face when deployed in the wild.

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. Multi-modal preference alignment remedies regression of visual instruction tuning on language model\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics benchmarks hierarchical multi-scale autoregressive language models*\n\n*Shengzhi Li, Rongyu Lin, Shichao Pei*\n\n**TL;DR:** A distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that reconciles the textual and visual performance of MLLMs, restoring and boosting language capability after visual instruction tuning is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** In production, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets which the underlying language model had been trained with. To address this challenging degradation, we first collect a lightweight (6k entries) VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for 5 quality metrics in a granular fashion, and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and SteerLM. Our findings indicate that the with DPO we are able to surpass instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99 despite small data scale. This enhancement in textual instruction proficiency correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\\% on MM-Vet, +6\\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that reconciles the textual and visual performance of MLLMs, restoring and boosting language capability after visual instruction tuning.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8.

However, it has yet to be explored for vision and multimodal tasks. In this work, we introduce MultiInstruct, the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks in a unified seq-to-seq format covering 10 broad categories. The tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source datasets and each task is equipped with 5 expert-written instructions. We take OFA as the base pre-trained model for multimodal instruction tuning, and to further improve its zero-shot performance, we explore multiple transfer learning strategies to leverage the large-scale Natural Instructions dataset. Experimental results demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on various unseen multimodal tasks and the benefit of transfer learning from a text-only instruction dataset. We also design a new evaluation metric \u2013 Sensitivity, to evaluate how sensitive the model is to the variety of instructions. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the model on a diverse set of tasks and instructions leads to a reduced sensitivity to variations in instructions for each task.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9.

Kira*\n\n**TL;DR:** Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite are proposed, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters, to achieve competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of theirTrainable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting large-scale pretrained models to various downstream tasks via fine-tuning is a standard method in machine learning. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods show promise in adapting a pretrained model to different tasks while training only a few parameters. Despite their success, most existing methods are proposed in Natural Language Processing tasks with language Transformers, and adaptation to Computer Vision tasks with Vision Transformers remains under-explored, especially for dense vision tasks. Further, in multi-task settings, individually fine-tuning and storing separate models for different tasks is inefficient. In this work, we provide an extensive multi-task parameter-efficient benchmark and examine existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning NLP methods for vision tasks. Our results on four different dense vision tasks showed that existing methods cannot be efficiently integrated due to the hierarchical nature of the Hierarchical Vision Transformers. To overcome this issue, we propose Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters. This leads to favorable performance improvements against existing parameter-efficient methods while using fewer trainable parameters. Specifically, Polyhistor achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of their trainable parameters. Furthermore, our methods show larger performance gains when large networks and more pretraining data are used.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. iVideoGPT: Interactive VideoGPTs are Scalable World Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Mingsheng Long, Jianye Hao, Dong Li, Xu He, Ningya Feng, Shaofeng Yin, Jialong Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Score: 0.84)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/46 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nHere, we give an overview of our architecture and discuss some of its key properties. Given an input sequence, it is first divided into chunks of size $K$. Each chunk is processed by perceptual module represented by a Transformer (denoted as $\\mathcal{F}$ ). While processing each chunk, $\\mathcal{F}$ is also conditioned on information from the Temporal Latent Bottleneck module $\\mathcal{G}$. The slow stream is a recurrent stream which has its own state consisting of a set of $N$ vectors (or slots) also called temporal latent bottleneck state denoted as $\\mathcal{I}$ in Figure 1 In the following sections, we use the term temporal latent bottleneck to refer to the temporal latent bottleneck state $\\mathcal{I}$. This state is updated once per chunk using information from the perceptual module through a cross attention mechanism. The perceptual module operates within each chunk while the temporal latent bottleneck operates across chunks slowly updating itself after each chunk has been processed by the perceptual module. Thus, the only way the perceptual module gets information about inputs beyond its own chunk is through the temporal latent bottleneck. An added advantage of this is that the computational complexity of the attention mechanism in the proposed model is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{T}{K}\\left(K^{2}+K N\\right)\\right)$ while that of a Transformer is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T^{2}\\right)$, where $T$ is the length of the sequence, $K$ is the chunk size, and $N$ is the number of temporal latent bottleneck state vectors. Since $K<<T$ and $N<<T$, we can see that $\\frac{T}{K}\\left(K^{2}+K N\\right)<T^{2}$. Therefore the proposed model has a much lower computational complexity compared to a Transformer. Furthermore, the capacity of the temporal latent bottleneck is limited and much smaller than that of the perceptual module. This encourages the temporal latent bottleneck to represent the most salient information about the past while the perceptual module represents only local information. This creates an information asymmetry between the two streams. This information asymmetry leads to the perceptual module having a fine grained view of the nearby inputs but a very coarse grained view of the distant past. This is very different from the usual selfattention which attends to all tokens in the sequence at the same level of granularity. An advantage of having a compressed representation of the past is that it allows the model to forget irrelevant information. For example, if an agent is navigating in a large maze, it does not need to have fine grained knowledge of its actions from the distant past. In the case of a Transformer, it would attend to every step from the past (including steps from the distant past) which may be irrelevant in the present context thus wasting its capacity in modeling irrelevant details. Another important component of the proposed model is top-down attention which conveys contextual information from\nthe high-level Temporal Latent Bottleneck module to the processing of low-level perceptual module. Past works (Mittal et al., 2020, Fan et al., 2021, Hill et al., 2020; Dai et al., 2019) have shown that top-down attention improves generalization and adaptation performance of the learned model. One difference between these works and the proposed model is that in their case the multiple streams operate at the same temporal granularity while in our case the streams operate at a different time scales (because of information asymmetry).\n```\n\n#### 3. Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg. Score: 0.68)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information.

To address this challenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are tested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or knowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social media data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information Bottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the distinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with timestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Furthermore, previous approaches have often neglected the crucial factor of language's evolving nature over time. In this work, we present a comprehensive perspective on toxicity mitigation that takes into account its changing nature. We introduce Goodtriever, a flexible methodology that matches the current state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while achieving 43% relative latency reduction during inference and being more computationally efficient. By incorporating a retrieval-based approach at decoding time, Goodtriever enables toxicity-controlled text generation. Our research advocates for an increased focus on adaptable mitigation techniques, which better reflect the data drift models face when deployed in the wild.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. iVideoGPT: Interactive VideoGPTs are Scalable World Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Mingsheng Long, Jianye Hao, Dong Li, Xu He, Ningya Feng, Shaofeng Yin, Jialong Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our work advances the development of interactive general world models, bridging the gap between generative video models and practical model-based reinforcement learning applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal, here are some key areas and specific information that would be most useful:\n\n### 1.

However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with O(1) time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle long-range dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalize LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan (Blelloch, 1990; Martin & Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.\n   ```\n\n2. **Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning**\n   \n   *Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke.*  \n   **Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)  \n   **Cited by:** 14 (*Influential: 3*)\n\n   **Excerpt:**\n   ```\n   The proposed approach divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of K time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n1. **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Architecture:**\n   - **Existing Concepts:** The **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** paper introduces a dual-stream architecture comprising fast and slow streams, where the slow stream maintains a compressed representation of the sequence. This aligns closely with the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal's aim to incorporate hierarchical processing and temporal latent bottlenecks.\n   - **Integration with FastTTTLinear:** The proposal builds upon these concepts by embedding them into the FastTTTLinear GAU framework, potentially enhancing its ability to manage long sequences more efficiently.\n\n2. **Temporal Latent Bottlenecks:**\n   - **Functionality and Impact:** Temporal latent bottlenecks serve as points for compressing and routing information through the network, enhancing memory efficiency and maintaining state information over extended contexts without escalating memory usage. This mechanism is crucial for preserving salient information while discarding irrelevant details, thereby improving the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n   - **Comparative Analysis:** The **Eagle and Finch** paper enhances the RWKV architecture with matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence, which may offer similar benefits to the temporal latent bottlenecks proposed in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**.\n\n3. **Adaptive State Compression:**\n   - **Techniques and Trade-offs:** Adaptive state compression tailors the level of compression based on the input data's characteristics, optimizing both memory usage and performance. It is essential to balance compression efficiency with information preservation to ensure that model performance is not adversely affected. The **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** approach implicitly handles this by forcefully compressing chunks of time steps into latent representations.\n   - **Novelty and Implementation:** The proposal's emphasis on adaptive state compression, combined with hierarchical processing, may offer a more refined approach compared to existing models, provided the integration is seamless and effectively manages trade-offs.\n\n4. **Integration with FastTTTLinear:**\n   - **Compatibility and Computational Impact:** Incorporating hierarchical multi-scale processing and adaptive compression into FastTTTLinear requires ensuring that these modifications do not conflict with existing components. The internal sources indicate advancements in architecture (e.g., **SPADE**) that integrate state-space models with Transformers, suggesting that similar integration strategies could be effective.\n   - **Model Complexity and Scalability:** The integration aims to maintain or reduce computational complexity while enhancing memory management. Existing models like **SPADE** demonstrate that augmenting state-space models with attention mechanisms can achieve efficient long-sequence processing, supporting the feasibility of the proposed enhancements.\n\n5. **Novelty Assessment:**\n   - **Comparison with Siblings:** The **Eagle and Finch** and **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** papers present approaches that share similarities with the hierarchical and compression mechanisms proposed in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**. However, the unique combination of these elements within the GAU framework and their specific implementation details in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** may provide sufficient novelty.\n   - **Unique Contributions:** If the proposal effectively integrates hierarchical processing with temporal latent bottlenecks and adaptive state compression in a manner that distinguishes it from existing models, it stands to make a meaningful contribution to the field of autoregressive language models.\n\n6. **Impact on Model Performance:**\n   - **Accuracy and Robustness:** By efficiently managing memory and compressing states adaptively, the model is expected to maintain high accuracy on long-sequence tasks and improve robustness against noise and irrelevant information.\n   - **Efficiency and Scalability:** The hierarchical architecture and adaptive compression should reduce computational and memory overheads, enabling the model to scale effectively as sequence length and data volume increase.\n\n#### 4.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models. Our code, hyperparameters and CUDA kernels for sparse attention are available in PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Sungjin Ahn, and Yoshua Bengio. 2017.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Goodtriever: Adaptive Toxicity Mitigation with Retrieval-augmented Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Luiza Pozzobon, B. Ermi\u015f, Patrick Lewis, Sara Hooker*\n\n**TL;DR:** Goodtriever is introduced, a flexible methodology that matches the current state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while achieving 43% relative latency reduction during inference and being more computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Considerable effort has been dedicated to mitigating toxicity, but existing methods often require drastic modifications to model parameters or the use of computationally intensive auxiliary models. Furthermore, previous approaches have often neglected the crucial factor of language's evolving nature over time. In this work, we present a comprehensive perspective on toxicity mitigation that takes into account its changing nature. We introduce Goodtriever, a flexible methodology that matches the current state-of-the-art toxicity mitigation while achieving 43% relative latency reduction during inference and being more computationally efficient. By incorporating a retrieval-based approach at decoding time, Goodtriever enables toxicity-controlled text generation. Our research advocates for an increased focus on adaptable mitigation techniques, which better reflect the data drift models face when deployed in the wild.

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. Multi-modal preference alignment remedies regression of visual instruction tuning on language model\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics benchmarks hierarchical multi-scale autoregressive language models*\n\n*Shengzhi Li, Rongyu Lin, Shichao Pei*\n\n**TL;DR:** A distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that reconciles the textual and visual performance of MLLMs, restoring and boosting language capability after visual instruction tuning is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** In production, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to support multi-turn queries of interchanging image and text modalities. However, the current MLLMs trained with visual-question-answering (VQA) datasets could suffer from degradation, as VQA datasets lack the diversity and complexity of the original text instruction datasets which the underlying language model had been trained with. To address this challenging degradation, we first collect a lightweight (6k entries) VQA preference dataset where answers were annotated by Gemini for 5 quality metrics in a granular fashion, and investigate standard Supervised Fine-tuning, rejection sampling, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and SteerLM. Our findings indicate that the with DPO we are able to surpass instruction-following capabilities of the language model, achieving a 6.73 score on MT-Bench, compared to Vicuna's 6.57 and LLaVA's 5.99 despite small data scale. This enhancement in textual instruction proficiency correlates with boosted visual instruction performance (+4.9\\% on MM-Vet, +6\\% on LLaVA-Bench), with minimal alignment tax on visual knowledge benchmarks compared to previous RLHF approach. In conclusion, we propose a distillation-based multi-modal alignment model with fine-grained annotations on a small dataset that reconciles the textual and visual performance of MLLMs, restoring and boosting language capability after visual instruction tuning.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8.

However, it has yet to be explored for vision and multimodal tasks. In this work, we introduce MultiInstruct, the first multimodal instruction tuning benchmark dataset that consists of 62 diverse multimodal tasks in a unified seq-to-seq format covering 10 broad categories. The tasks are derived from 21 existing open-source datasets and each task is equipped with 5 expert-written instructions. We take OFA as the base pre-trained model for multimodal instruction tuning, and to further improve its zero-shot performance, we explore multiple transfer learning strategies to leverage the large-scale Natural Instructions dataset. Experimental results demonstrate strong zero-shot performance on various unseen multimodal tasks and the benefit of transfer learning from a text-only instruction dataset. We also design a new evaluation metric \u2013 Sensitivity, to evaluate how sensitive the model is to the variety of instructions. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the model on a diverse set of tasks and instructions leads to a reduced sensitivity to variations in instructions for each task.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9. Polyhistor: Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation for Dense Vision Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: performance metrics benchmarks hierarchical multi-scale autoregressive language models*\n\n*Yen-Cheng Liu, Chih-Yao Ma, Junjiao Tian, Zijian He, Z. Kira*\n\n**TL;DR:** Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite are proposed, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters, to achieve competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of theirTrainable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting large-scale pretrained models to various downstream tasks via fine-tuning is a standard method in machine learning. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods show promise in adapting a pretrained model to different tasks while training only a few parameters. Despite their success, most existing methods are proposed in Natural Language Processing tasks with language Transformers, and adaptation to Computer Vision tasks with Vision Transformers remains under-explored, especially for dense vision tasks. Further, in multi-task settings, individually fine-tuning and storing separate models for different tasks is inefficient. In this work, we provide an extensive multi-task parameter-efficient benchmark and examine existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning NLP methods for vision tasks. Our results on four different dense vision tasks showed that existing methods cannot be efficiently integrated due to the hierarchical nature of the Hierarchical Vision Transformers. To overcome this issue, we propose Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters. This leads to favorable performance improvements against existing parameter-efficient methods while using fewer trainable parameters. Specifically, Polyhistor achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of their trainable parameters. Furthermore, our methods show larger performance gains when large networks and more pretraining data are used.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. iVideoGPT: Interactive VideoGPTs are Scalable World Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression techniques sequence models*\n\n*Mingsheng Long, Jianye Hao, Dong Li, Xu He, Ningya Feng, Shaofeng Yin, Jialong Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** World models empower model-based agents to interactively explore, reason, and plan within imagined environments for real-world decision-making. However, the high demand for interactivity poses challenges in harnessing recent advancements in video generative models for developing world models at scale. This work introduces Interactive VideoGPT (iVideoGPT), a scalable autoregressive transformer framework that integrates multimodal signals--visual observations, actions, and rewards--into a sequence of tokens, facilitating an interactive experience of agents via next-token prediction. iVideoGPT features a novel compressive tokenization technique that efficiently discretizes high-dimensional visual observations. Leveraging its scalable architecture, we are able to pre-train iVideoGPT on millions of human and robotic manipulation trajectories, establishing a versatile foundation that is adaptable to serve as interactive world models for a wide range of downstream tasks. These include action-conditioned video prediction, visual planning, and model-based reinforcement learning, where iVideoGPT achieves competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The **BP-Transformer** uses binary partitioning for multi-scale attention, reducing computational complexity to \\(O(k \\cdot n \\log(n/k))\\).\n- The **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** employs a dual-stream architecture with fast and slow processing streams, compressing information into latent representations. This approach can be adapted to enhance the GAU's capacity to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\n\n- Temporal latent bottlenecks are crucial for managing memory efficiently and capturing long-range dependencies. Models like **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** and **Hieros** use similar strategies to enhance sequence modeling by compressing chunks of time steps into latent representations.\n- This mechanism can be integrated into **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** to maintain essential information while discarding irrelevant details, thus improving efficiency and performance in handling long sequences.\n\n### Adaptive State Compression\n\n- Adaptive state compression techniques, such as those discussed in **HiPPO** and other state-space models, can be adapted for GAUs. These techniques optimize function approximation over time using polynomial projections, ensuring that critical information is retained while reducing memory usage.\n- The **Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models** paper introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance to self-attention-based models while being more efficient. This can serve as a reference for implementing adaptive state compression in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**.\n\n### Integration with Existing GAUs\n\n- The integration of hierarchical processing and compression mechanisms with existing GAUs must be seamless. Models like **SPADE** and **Efficient Beam Tree Recursion** provide insights into combining state-space models with attention mechanisms without compromising computational efficiency.\n- The **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling** paper shows how to eliminate matrix multiplication operations, which dominate the computational cost of large language models, while maintaining strong performance. This can inform strategies to manage and optimize computational resources in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**.\n\n### Novelty and Contribution\n\n- The unique combination of hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression in the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal differentiates it from other designs like **liquidttt** and **ssmfasttttlinear**.\n- This integration has the potential to offer significant advancements in autoregressive language models, particularly in enhancing their ability to process long sequences with improved efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further refine the proposal, the following search queries and objectives are recommended:\n\n#### External Sources Search\n- **Query:** `keywords hierarchical multi-scale processing temporal latent bottleneck adaptive state compression autoregressive models`\n- **Objective:** Uncover detailed implementations, comparative analyses, and performance evaluations of models that integrate these mechanisms within GAUs or autoregressive models.\n\n#### Internal Library Search\n- **Query:** `description Hierarchical multi-scale processing combined with temporal latent bottlenecks and adaptive state compression within GAUs or autoregressive language models for enhanced long-sequence efficiency and expressiveness`\n- **Objective:** Identify more internal research papers or technical documents that discuss advanced hierarchical architectures, state compression techniques, or temporal processing mechanisms in GAUs or similar architectures.\n\n#### Investigate Comparative Models\n- **Query:** `keywords SPADE model state space transformer hierarchical attention`\n- **Objective:** Explore how similar models like **SPADE**, **MEGA**, and **Hawk** have implemented hierarchical and compression mechanisms to understand best practices and identify potential integration strategies.\n\n#### Explore Adaptive Compression Techniques\n- **Query:** `keywords adaptive state compression techniques sequence models`\n- **Objective:** Gather information on the latest adaptive state compression methods and their applications in sequence modeling to inform the implementation of adaptive compression in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive insights to validate and refine the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal, ensuring its innovation, feasibility, and potential impact on the field of autoregressive language models.\n",
