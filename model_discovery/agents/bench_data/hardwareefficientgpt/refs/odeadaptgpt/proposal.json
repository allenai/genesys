A Length-Extrapolatable Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Barun Patra, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Alon Benhaim, Vishrav Chaudhary, Xia Song, Furu Wei*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2022)\t**Cited by** 70  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a relative position embedding to explicitly maximize attention resolution in Transformers and uses blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Position modeling plays a critical role in Transformers. In this paper, we focus on length extrapolation, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating longer sequences. We define attention resolution as an indicator of extrapolation. Then we propose two designs to improve the above metric of Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a relative position embedding to explicitly maximize attention resolution. Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling. Experimental results show that our model achieves strong performance in both interpolation and extrapolation settings. The code will be available at https://aka.ms/LeX-Transformer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/19 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nFirst, the computation or memory consumption is not efficient enough for long sequences. Second, there is a trade-off between performance and efficiency. One popular solution (Wang et al., 2020b; Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020) is linear attention, i.e., using a kernel-based or low-rank approximation to replace vanilla attention. The methods typically target efficiency while underperforming vanilla Transformers for regular length. Another strand is sparse attention (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Xiong et al., 2021), which usually leverages structured sparsity to reduce computation. For causal sequence modeling, the recurrent-style designs (Dai et al., 2019; Hutchins et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022b) are also competitive. In comparison, we focus on the extrapolation issue (Press et al., 2021) for language modeling, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating long texts. The training process is kept the same as vanilla Transformers, i.e., training on short sequences, and using dense attention computation. The capability of long-sequence modeling is given for free during inference. So the training efficiency (which is typically expensive for large-scale language models) is not affected compared with previous work. Moreover, the performance on regular length is perfectly retained, without trade-offs for long-sequence modeling. ### 5.2 Position Modeling\n\n### 5.2.1 Absolute Position Embedding\n\nAbsolute sinusoidal position embedding is proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017). For each dimension, different frequencies are encoded from $2 \\pi$ to $10000 \\times 2 \\pi$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{PE}_{(p o s, 2 i)} & =\\cos \\left(p o s / 10000^{2 i / d_{\\mathrm{model}}}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathrm{PE}_{(p o s, 2 i+1)} & =\\sin \\left(p o s / 10000^{2 i / d_{\\mathrm{model}}}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{PE}_{p o s+k}$ is represented as a linear function of $\\mathrm{PE}_{p o s}$ to restore a relative-position property. ### 5.2.2 Relative Position Embedding\n\nShaw et al. (2018) propose relative position embedding as an alternative approach. Denote $e_{i j}$ as attention weight, $\\alpha_{i j}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(e_{i j}\\right), o_{i}$ as output, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\ne_{i j}=\\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}}{\\sqrt{d}} \\Longrightarrow \\frac{\\boldsymbol{q}_{i} \\cdot\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}+\\boldsymbol{a}_{i j}^{K}\\right)}{\\sqrt{d}} \\\\\no_{i}=\\sum_{j} \\alpha_{i j} \\boldsymbol{v}_{j} \\Longrightarrow \\sum_{j} \\alpha_{i j}\\left(\\boldsymbol{v}_{j}+\\boldsymbol{a}_{i j}^{V}\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{a}_{i j}^{K}=\\omega_{\\operatorname{clip}(i-j, k)}^{K}, \\boldsymbol{a}_{i j}^{V}=\\omega_{\\operatorname{clip}(i-j, k)}^{V}$, and $\\omega^{K}$ and $\\omega^{V}$ are learnable parameters.\n```\n\n#### 2. Contextual Position Encoding: Learning to Count What's Important (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Olga Golovneva, Tianlu Wang, Jason Weston, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is a critical component of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allows tokens in a sequence to interact with each other, but is order-invariant. Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/25 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nIn Fig. 4. we show examples of attention maps from a model trained with sep-keys (gates are computed with separated keys, see Section 4 ). The attention maps are built from position alone (they have to be multiplied by context attention for the final attention), which gives us better insight into what CoPE is doing. We also normalize so that the maximum attention weight is always 1 for each query. First, we can see that positions are clearly contextualized as the attention tends to drop at specific tokens regardless of their relative positions. A closer look at those tokens reveals that the attentions are mostly focused on the last paragraph (left) or section (right). For clarity, the actual paragraph and section boundaries are marked by black plus signs. In CoPE, this is possible because one attention head can count paragraphs while another counts sections, and then it can focus on position 0 only. For more details, see the gate values shown in Appendix Fig.6, and further ablation results in Appendix D\n\n### 5.5 Code Modeling\n\nWe further test the ability of CoPE by evaluating on code data. Code data has more structure compared to natural language, and might be more sensitive to in-context learning. We train a small 20M Transformer model that resembles the Llama-2 architecture with the corresponding mix of code data [Touvron et al., 2023b] with 4 layers, 8 heads, and a hidden dimension of 256. We use context length 4096, learning rate $5.0 e-4$, and train for 100B tokens. The results are summarized in Table 5 (right). CoPE embeddings improve in perplexity over absolute PE and RoPE by $17 \\%$ and 5\\% correspondingly. Combining RoPE and CoPE embeddings together improves over RoPE, but does not bring any improvements over the proposed embedding method. ## 6 Related Work\n\nWhile the attention mechanism was proposed in Bahdanau et al. [2014] for processing sequences of tokens, the model was still based on RNNs so position encoding (PE) was not necessary. The Memory Network [Weston et al., 2015] architecture moved away from RNNs when processing sequences, instead using multiple layers of attention, and first introduced using PE together with the attention mechanism [Sukhbaatar et al., 2015]. They added learnable embedding vectors that correspond to each relative position to the hidden representations. A similar position embedding was used earlier in a convolution-based architecture [Collobert and Weston, 2008], and later in an architecture that combines convolution with attention [Gehring et al., 2017]. The latter used an absolute PE because relative position cannot be defined on the source text in machine translation. PE became in an important topic of research with the popularity of the Transformer architecture. The original paper by Vaswani et al. 2017] employed an absolute PE with fixed vectors, but the relative position embedding was later used in Shaw et al. [2018]. Relative PE is especially suited to processing unbounded sequences [Dai et al., 2019]. Since then, many different variations of relative and absolute PE have been proposed. In Raffel et al. [2020], each relative position is assigned a simple bias scalar that gets added to the attention logits. While being efficient, this makes position addressing independent of the current token. Press et al. [2022] further simplifies the bias terms by making them fixed in a decaying pattern instead of learning for generalization to longer context. Haviv et al. [2022] takes it to the extreme by removing PE and demonstrated that position information can be recovered by counting previous tokens with causal attention. While absolute PE was used in early LLMs [Radford et al., 2019], relative PE is more common in recent LLMs [Touvron et al., 2023b], Jiang et al., 2023]. In particular, RoPE [Su et al., 2024] made it possible to do relative PE without modifying the self-attention code. It relies on the fact that query and key dot product only depend on the angle between those vectors and are agnostic to their absolute angles. Thus if they are rotated by angles proportional to their absolute position, then its effect on the attention logit will only depend on their difference in position. However, CoPE differs from all these PE methods as it measures position in a context dependent way instead of simply using token counts. While RNNs can be inserted into the Transformer architecture to represent position information in an implicit way [Wang et al., 2019, Neishi and Yoshinaga, 2019], the sequential nature of RNN operations breaks the parallelization of Transformer training, making it slower and less practical. In comparison, the only sequential operation in CoPE is a cumulative sum, which is lightweight and can be partially parallelized.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. Functional Interpolation for Relative Positions Improves Long Context Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Shanda Li, Chong You, Guru Guruganesh, J. Ainslie, Santiago Ontanon, M. Zaheer, Sumit K. Sanghai, Yiming Yang, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple, and empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Preventing the performance decay of Transformers on inputs longer than those used for training has been an important challenge in extending the context length of these models. Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/43 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\n694-711.

Neural Differential Equations for Learning to Program Neural Nets Through Continuous Learning Rules\n\n*From Search Query: continuous position encoding neural ODE attention*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, Francesco Faccio, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel combination of learning rules and Neural ODEs to build continuous-time sequence processing nets that learn to manipulate short-term memory in rapidly changing synaptic connections of other nets.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have attracted much attention as continuous-time counterparts of deep residual neural networks (NNs), and numerous extensions for recurrent NNs have been proposed. Since the 1980s, ODEs have also been used to derive theoretical results for NN learning rules, e.g., the famous connection between Oja's rule and principal component analysis. Such rules are typically expressed as additive iterative update processes which have straightforward ODE counterparts. Here we introduce a novel combination of learning rules and Neural ODEs to build continuous-time sequence processing nets that learn to manipulate short-term memory in rapidly changing synaptic connections of other nets. This yields continuous-time counterparts of Fast Weight Programmers and linear Transformers. Our novel models outperform the best existing Neural Controlled Differential Equation based models on various time series classification tasks, while also addressing their fundamental scalability limitations.

Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: continuous position encoding neural ODE attention*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A. Wright, Azalia Mirhoseini, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel readout mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding, and suggests that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long- range relationships on graphs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

CAPE: Encoding Relative Positions with Continuous Augmented Positional Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: continuous position encoding neural ODE attention*\n\n*Tatiana Likhomanenko, Qiantong Xu, R. Collobert, Gabriel Synnaeve, A. Rogozhnikov*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute and relative positions and leads to better generalization performance as well as increased stability with respect to training hyper-parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Without positional information, attention-based Transformer neural networks are permutation-invariant. Absolute or relative positional embeddings are the most popular ways to feed Transformer models with positional information. Absolute positional embeddings are simple to implement, but suffer from generalization issues when evaluating on sequences longer than seen at training time. Relative positions are more robust to input length change, but are more complex to implement and yield inferior model throughput due to extra computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose an augmentation-based approach (CAPE) for absolute positional embeddings, which keeps the advantages of both absolute (simplicity and speed) and relative positional embeddings (better generalization). In addition, our empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art models in machine translation, image and speech recognition demonstrates that CAPE leads to better generalization performance as well as increased stability with respect to training hyper-parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4.

ODE Discovery for Longitudinal Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Inference\n\n*From Search Query: continuous position encoding neural ODE attention*\n\n*Krzysztof Kacprzyk, Samuel Holt, Jeroen Berrevoets, Zhaozhi Qian, M. Schaar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a different type of solution in the longitudinal setting: a closed-form ordinary differential equation (ODE), and formulates this contribution as a framework that can transform any ODE discovery method into a treatment effects method.\n\n**Abstract:** Inferring unbiased treatment effects has received widespread attention in the machine learning community. In recent years, our community has proposed numerous solutions in standard settings, high-dimensional treatment settings, and even longitudinal settings. While very diverse, the solution has mostly relied on neural networks for inference and simultaneous correction of assignment bias. New approaches typically build on top of previous approaches by proposing new (or refined) architectures and learning algorithms. However, the end result -- a neural-network-based inference machine -- remains unchallenged. In this paper, we introduce a different type of solution in the longitudinal setting: a closed-form ordinary differential equation (ODE). While we still rely on continuous optimization to learn an ODE, the resulting inference machine is no longer a neural network. Doing so yields several advantages such as interpretability, irregular sampling, and a different set of identification assumptions. Above all, we consider the introduction of a completely new type of solution to be our most important contribution as it may spark entirely new innovations in treatment effects in general. We facilitate this by formulating our contribution as a framework that can transform any ODE discovery method into a treatment effects method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Latent Neural ODEs with Sparse Bayesian Multiple Shooting\n\n*From Search Query: continuous position encoding neural ODE attention*\n\n*Harri L\u00e4hdesm\u00e4ki, Markus Heinonen, Cagatay Yildiz, Valerii Iakovlev*\n\n**Abstract:** Training dynamic models, such as neural ODEs, on long trajectories is a hard problem that requires using various tricks, such as trajectory splitting, to make model training work in practice. These methods are often heuristics with poor theoretical justifications, and require iterative manual tuning. We propose a principled multiple shooting technique for neural ODEs that splits the trajectories into manageable short segments, which are optimised in parallel, while ensuring probabilistic control on continuity over consecutive segments. We derive variational inference for our shooting-based latent neural ODE models and propose amortized encodings of irregularly sampled trajectories with a transformer-based recognition network with temporal attention and relative positional encoding. We demonstrate efficient and stable training, and state-of-the-art performance on multiple large-scale benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of neural ODEs with attention mechanisms and position encoding, here are some key points and potential directions based on the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Continuous Position Encoding Methods\n\n- The work on \"CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models\" suggests using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to model the continuous dynamics of position encoding. This approach generalizes position encoding scaling methods, allowing for more flexible and continuous length extrapolation. Integrating this ODE-based method with the current hierarchical adaptive multi-head attention could enhance the model's ability to handle varying sequence lengths efficiently.\n\n## ODE-based Approaches to Sequence Modeling\n\n- The concept of using ODEs for sequence modeling, as seen in \"CLEX,\" can be extended to other components of the model. For instance, ODEs could be used for continuous adaptation in dynamic normalization, allowing smoother transitions across different sequence lengths and better handling of varying input distributions. This aligns with the idea of enhancing dynamic normalization with ODE-based continuous adaptation.\n\n## Adaptive Position Encoding Schemes\n\n- Combining the distance-based attention bias from \"Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\" with the ODE-based continuous length extrapolation from \"CLEX\" could provide a robust and efficient position encoding scheme. This approach would avoid adding positional embeddings to word embeddings, instead using a penalty proportional to the distance between tokens, which can be modeled continuously using ODEs.\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms for Long Sequences\n\n- The block-based processing approach from \"Blockwise Self-Attention for Long Document Understanding\" can be integrated with hierarchical attention to reduce memory consumption and training/inference time. This method allows attention heads to capture both short- and long-range contextual information efficiently, which is crucial for handling long sequences.\n\n## Integration of ODEs with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- To integrate ODEs with attention mechanisms, one could use ODEs to model the continuous dynamics of attention patterns. For example, ODEs can be used to continuously update the attention weights based on the input sequence, allowing for more flexible and adaptive attention mechanisms. This integration can help in better capturing long-range dependencies and handling varying sequence lengths.\n\n## Advanced Normalization Techniques\n\n- Enhancing the dynamic normalization in the seed design with ODE-based continuous adaptation can provide more sophisticated adaptive mechanisms. This would enable the model to adapt smoothly to different sequence lengths and input distributions, improving overall performance and robustness.\n\n### Specific Areas to Explore\n\n- **Continuous Position Encoding**: Investigate how ODEs can be used to model continuous position encoding, allowing for more flexible and efficient handling of varying sequence lengths.\n- **ODE-based Attention**: Explore how ODEs can be integrated into attention mechanisms to continuously update attention weights and better capture long-range dependencies.\n- **Block-based Processing**: Implement block-based processing to reduce computational costs while maintaining the ability to capture both local and global dependencies.\n- **Advanced Normalization**: Develop ODE-based continuous adaptation for dynamic normalization to enhance the model's adaptability to different sequence lengths and input distributions.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can leverage the strengths of ODEs, adaptive position encoding, and efficient attention mechanisms to improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly in handling long sequences, capturing long-range dependencies, and adapting to varying input lengths.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/40 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2104.09864, 2021.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: ODE attention mechanism neural networks implementation*\n\n*Xinyi Wu, A. Ajorlou, Zihui Wu, A. Jadbabaie*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is established that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially.\n\n**Abstract:** Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: ODE attention mechanism neural networks implementation*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A. Wright, Azalia Mirhoseini, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel readout mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding, and suggests that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long- range relationships on graphs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

DEGREE: Decomposition Based Explanation for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: ODE attention mechanism neural networks implementation*\n\n*Qizhang Feng, Ninghao Liu, Fan Yang, Ruixiang Tang, Mengnan Du, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** By decomposing the information generation and aggregation mechanism of GNNs, DEGREE allows tracking the contributions of specific components of the input graph to the final prediction and designs a subgraph level interpretation algorithm to reveal complex interactions between graph nodes that are overlooked by previous methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are gaining extensive attention for their application in graph data. However, the black-box nature of GNNs prevents users from understanding and trusting the models, thus hampering their applicability. Whereas explaining GNNs remains a challenge, most existing methods fall into approximation based and perturbation based approaches with suffer from faithfulness problems and unnatural artifacts, respectively. To tackle these problems, we propose DEGREE \\degree to provide a faithful explanation for GNN predictions. By decomposing the information generation and aggregation mechanism of GNNs, DEGREE allows tracking the contributions of specific components of the input graph to the final prediction. Based on this, we further design a subgraph level interpretation algorithm to reveal complex interactions between graph nodes that are overlooked by previous methods. The efficiency of our algorithm can be further improved by utilizing GNN characteristics. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of DEGREE on node classification and graph classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Interpretable and Generalizable Graph Learning via Stochastic Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: ODE attention mechanism neural networks implementation*\n\n*Siqi Miao, Miaoyuan Liu, Pan Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stoChasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation.\n\n**Abstract:** Interpretable graph learning is in need as many scientific applications depend on learning models to collect insights from graph-structured data. Previous works mostly focused on using post-hoc approaches to interpret pre-trained models (graph neural networks in particular). They argue against inherently interpretable models because the good interpretability of these models is often at the cost of their prediction accuracy. However, those post-hoc methods often fail to provide stable interpretation and may extract features that are spuriously correlated with the task. In this work, we address these issues by proposing Graph Stochastic Attention (GSAT). Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stochasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation. The selected subgraphs provably do not contain patterns that are spuriously correlated with the task under some assumptions. Extensive experiments on eight datasets show that GSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 20%$\\uparrow$ in interpretation AUC and 5%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy.

IM-Loss: Information Maximization Loss for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: ODE attention mechanism neural networks implementation*\n\n*Yu-Zhu Guo, Y. Chen, Liwen Zhang, Xiaode Liu, Yinglei Wang, Xuhui Huang, Zhe Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets show that the SNN models trained by the proposed IM-Loss outperform the current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Network (SNN), recognized as a type of biologically plausible architecture, has recently drawn much research attention. It transmits information by 0 / 1 spikes. This bio-mimetic mechanism of SNN demonstrates extreme energy efficiency since it avoids any multiplications on neuromorphic hardware. However, the forward-passing 0 / 1 spike quantization will cause information loss and accuracy degradation. To deal with this problem, the Information maximization loss (IM-Loss) that aims at maximizing the information flow in the SNN is proposed in the paper. The IM-Loss not only enhances the information expressiveness of an SNN directly but also plays a part of the role of normalization without introducing any additional operations ( e.g. , bias and scaling) in the inference phase. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiable spike activity estimation, Evolutionary Surrogate Gradients (ESG) in SNNs. By appointing automatic evolvable surrogate gradients for spike activity function, ESG can ensure sufficient model updates at the beginning and accurate gradients at the end of the training, resulting in both easy convergence and high task performance. Experimental results on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets show that the SNN models trained by our method outperform the current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on ODE-based attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Mathematical Formulations of ODE Attention\n\nODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) can be integrated into attention mechanisms to model continuous dynamics of attention patterns. For instance, the work on \"Neural Differential Equations for Learning to Program Neural Nets\" suggests combining learning rules with Neural ODEs to build continuous-time sequence processing nets. This approach can enable smooth transitions across sequence lengths and better handling of varying input distributions[2,.\n\nA specific formulation could involve using ODEs to update the attention weights continuously, rather than discretely. This can be achieved by defining the attention mechanism as a solution to an ODE, where the dynamics of the attention weights are governed by the ODE's parameters and the input sequence.\n\n## Integration with Transformer Architectures\n\nIntegrating ODE-based attention mechanisms into transformer architectures can enhance their performance and efficiency. For example, the concept of \"Continuous Augmented Positional Embeddings\" (CAPE) can be extended to include ODEs for position encoding. CAPE has shown better generalization performance and stability with respect to training hyperparameters, which can be further improved by using ODEs to model continuous position encoding[1,.\n\nThe \"Length-Extrapolatable Transformer\" paper also provides insights into how attention resolution can be improved using novel designs, which could be combined with ODE-based attention mechanisms to enhance length extrapolation capabilities[3,.\n\n## Computational Efficiency Considerations\n\nTo address the computational efficiency of ODE-based attention mechanisms, several strategies can be employed:\n\n- **Block-based Processing**: Similar to the \"FlashAttention\" technique, dividing large matrices into smaller blocks can reduce memory usage and computational complexity. This approach can be adapted for ODE-based attention mechanisms to process attention over smaller blocks, minimizing memory footprint and computation time.\n\n- **Hierarchical Structures**: Implementing hierarchical attention mechanisms can capture multi-scale dependencies efficiently. This can involve using ODEs at different scales to model both short-range and long-range dependencies, reducing the overall computational cost[3,.\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Sparse attention can be integrated with ODE-based mechanisms to focus only on the most relevant tokens, thereby decreasing both memory and computational requirements. This can be particularly beneficial for long sequences where traditional self-attention mechanisms become computationally expensive.\n\n## Adaptive Components and Normalization\n\nTo further enhance the model, adaptive components and normalization techniques can be integrated:\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Generation**: Using ODEs to generate dynamic parameters can allow the model to adapt to different input distributions and sequence lengths. This can be combined with context-dependent adaptation mechanisms to improve the model's flexibility and performance[2,.\n\n- **Context-Dependent Position Encoding**: Techniques like \"Contextual Position Encoding\" (CoPE) can be used to make position encoding more context-aware. This can be integrated with ODE-based attention mechanisms to ensure that the model captures the most relevant contextual information[4,.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of ODE-based attention mechanisms, efficient computation methods, and adaptive components to achieve better performance, scalability, and efficiency.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/40 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\non p. 16).

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/54 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42(3):532-538, 1994.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/54 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nW.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation efficient attention*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint Method for Gradient Estimation in Neural ODE\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation efficient attention*\n\n*Juntang Zhuang, N. Dvornek, Xiaoxiao Li, S. Tatikonda, X. Papademetris, J. Duncan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method is proposed: in automatic differentiation, ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode trajectory as the reverse- mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy, and ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have recently attracted increasing attention; however, their empirical performance on benchmark tasks (e.g. image classification) are significantly inferior to discrete-layer models. We demonstrate an explanation for their poorer performance is the inaccuracy of existing gradient estimation methods: the adjoint method has numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method directly back-propagates through ODE solvers, but suffers from a redundantly deep computation graph when searching for the optimal stepsize. We propose the Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: in automatic differentiation, ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods. Finally, in an example of the three-body problem, we show NODE with ACA can incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy. We provide the PyTorch implementation of ACA: https://github.com/juntang-zhuang/torch-ACA.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 3. Understanding the Role of Self Attention for Efficient Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation efficient attention*\n\n*Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Wonyong Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is discovered that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved and implemented the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieves noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention (SA) is a critical component of Transformer neural networks that have succeeded in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we analyze the role of SA in Transformer-based ASR models for not only understanding the mechanism of improved recognition accuracy but also lowering the computational complexity. We reveal that SA performs two distinct roles: phonetic and linguistic localization. Especially, we show by experiments that phonetic localization in the lower layers extracts phonologically meaningful features from speech and reduces the phonetic variance in the utterance for proper linguistic localization in the upper layers. From this understanding, we discover that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved. To evaluate this idea, we implement the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieve up to 1.96 times speedup in inference and 33% savings in training time with noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Sparsely-Connected Neural Networks: Towards Efficient VLSI Implementation of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation efficient attention*\n\n*A. Ardakani, C. Condo, W. Gross*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparsely-connected neural networks are proposed, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets while proposing an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely- connected networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. MALI: A memory efficient and reverse accurate integrator for Neural ODEs\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation efficient attention*\n\n*Juntang Zhuang, N. Dvornek, S. Tatikonda, J. Duncan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Memory-efficient ALF Integrator (MALI) is proposed, which has a constant memory cost, number of solver steps in integration similar to the adjoint method, and guarantees accuracy in reverse-time trajectory (hence accuracy in gradient estimation).\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) are a new family of deep-learning models with continuous depth. However, the numerical estimation of the gradient in the continuous case is not well solved: existing implementations of the adjoint method suffer from inaccuracy in reverse-time trajectory, while the naive method and the adaptive checkpoint adjoint method (ACA) have a memory cost that grows with integration time. In this project, based on the asynchronous leapfrog (ALF) solver, we propose the Memory-efficient ALF Integrator (MALI), which has a constant memory cost \\textit{w.r.t} number of solver steps in integration similar to the adjoint method, and guarantees accuracy in reverse-time trajectory (hence accuracy in gradient estimation). We validate MALI in various tasks: on image recognition tasks, to our knowledge, MALI is the first to enable feasible training of a Neural ODE on ImageNet and outperform a well-tuned ResNet, while existing methods fail due to either heavy memory burden or inaccuracy; for time series modeling, MALI significantly outperforms the adjoint method; and for continuous generative models, MALI achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

For example, the \"FlashAttention\" algorithm divides large matrices into smaller blocks (tiling technique) to compute attention over these blocks, reducing memory footprint and speeding up computations.\n\n### Linear-Time Attention Mechanisms\nLinear attention mechanisms, such as those proposed in \"Transformer Quality in Linear Time,\" can handle sequences efficiently without the quadratic complexity of traditional self-attention. This approach allows for weaker single-head attention with minimal quality loss, making it scalable for long sequences (though not directly mentioned in the provided sources, it is a relevant concept from the analysis).\n\n## Memory Optimization Methods\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nSparse attention mechanisms can focus only on the most relevant tokens, reducing both memory and computational requirements. This is a strategy to mitigate the efficiency issues associated with traditional self-attention.\n\n### Memory Compression Techniques\nTechniques like quantization and pruning can help reduce the memory footprint of the model without significantly impacting performance. These methods are crucial for deploying models on resource-constrained devices.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Neural ODEs for Continuous Dynamics\nNeural ODEs can model the continuous dynamics of attention patterns, enabling smooth transitions across sequence lengths. For instance, the NODEPT framework uses an ODE-based generative module to track the evolution of the underlying diffusion system, which can be adapted to model attention dynamics. This approach integrates an attention mechanism to adaptively aggregate information from a memory module, capturing intricate interactions between different elements.\n\n### Attention Mechanisms in Neural ODEs\nThe NODEPT framework employs an attention mechanism to model interactions between cascades. This mechanism maps the latent state of cascades and the memory matrix to their interaction representation, which is crucial for capturing the continuous dynamics of attention patterns.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration Strategies\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly accelerate matrix operations involved in attention mechanisms. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing latency and energy consumption. For example, the memristor-based accelerator for transformer self-attention achieves high accuracy and efficiency by performing matrix operations in an analog manner using memristor crossbar arrays.\n\n### Efficient Architectures\nExploring alternative architectures like SwiftFormer, which introduces an efficient additive attention mechanism, can enhance computational efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. SwiftFormer replaces traditional quadratic matrix multiplication operations with linear element-wise multiplications, making it suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained devices.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design:\n\n- **Use block-based processing and linear-time attention mechanisms** to reduce computational complexity and memory usage.\n- **Implement sparse attention and memory compression techniques** to optimize memory efficiency.\n- **Integrate neural ODEs with attention mechanisms** to model continuous attention dynamics and capture intricate interactions.\n- **Leverage hardware acceleration strategies**, such as memristor-based in-memory computing and efficient architectures like SwiftFormer, to enhance performance and efficiency.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving the goals of low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and good scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.75)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Space and Time Continuous Physics Simulation From Partial Observations\n\n*From Search Query: continuous attention dynamics implementation hardware*\n\n*Steeven Janny, Madiha Nadri Wolf, Julie Digne, Christian Wolf*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern techniques for physical simulations rely on numerical schemes and mesh-refinement methods to address trade-offs between precision and complexity, but these handcrafted solutions are tedious and require high computational power. Data-driven methods based on large-scale machine learning promise high adaptivity by integrating long-range dependencies more directly and efficiently. In this work, we focus on fluid dynamics and address the shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent GNNs and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation at arbitrary space and time locations.

Motivated by these challenges, we present Gigastep, a fully vectorizable, MARL environment implemented in JAX, capable of executing up to one billion environment steps per second on consumer-grade hardware. Its design allows for comprehensive MARL experimentation, including a complex, high-dimensional space defined by 3D dynamics, stochasticity, and partial observations. Gigastep supports both collaborative and adversarial tasks, continuous and discrete action spaces, and provides RGB image and feature vector observations, allowing the evaluation of a wide range of MARL algorithms.

Deep active inference agents using Monte-Carlo methods\n\n*From Search Query: continuous attention dynamics implementation hardware*\n\n*Z. Fountas, Noor Sajid, P. Mediano, Karl J. Friston*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling, which enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** Active inference is a Bayesian framework for understanding biological intelligence. The underlying theory brings together perception and action under one single imperative: minimizing free energy. However, despite its theoretical utility in explaining intelligence, computational implementations have been restricted to low-dimensional and idealized situations. In this paper, we present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state transitions and actions (i.e., plan), to evince reward-directed navigation - despite temporary suspension of visual input. These results show that deep active inference - equipped with MC methods - provides a flexible framework to develop biologically-inspired intelligent agents, with applications in both machine learning and cognitive science.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 94  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Progressive Stochastic Binarization of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous attention dynamics implementation hardware*\n\n*David Hartmann, Michael Wand*\n\n**Abstract:** A plethora of recent research has focused on improving the memory footprint\nand inference speed of deep networks by reducing the complexity of (i)\nnumerical representations (for example, by deterministic or stochastic\nquantization) and (ii) arithmetic operations (for example, by binarization of\nweights).\n  We propose a stochastic binarization scheme for deep networks that allows for\nefficient inference on hardware by restricting itself to additions of small\nintegers and fixed shifts. Unlike previous approaches, the underlying\nrandomized approximation is progressive, thus permitting an adaptive control of\nthe accuracy of each operation at run-time. In a low-precision setting, we\nmatch the accuracy of previous binarized approaches. Our representation is\nunbiased - it approaches continuous computation with increasing sample size. In\na high-precision regime, the computational costs are competitive with previous\nquantization schemes. Progressive stochastic binarization also permits\nlocalized, dynamic accuracy control within a single network, thereby providing\na new tool for adaptively focusing computational attention.\n  We evaluate our method on networks of various architectures, already\npretrained on ImageNet. With representational costs comparable to previous\nschemes, we obtain accuracies close to the original floating point\nimplementation. This includes pruned networks, except the known special case of\ncertain types of separated convolutions. By focusing computational attention\nusing progressive sampling, we reduce inference costs on ImageNet further by a\nfactor of up to 33% (before network pruning).\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations of continuous attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Integration with Neural Architectures\n\n- **Tensorized Attention**: This approach integrates well with existing neural architectures, such as transformers, and enhances their performance on long sequences. Tensorized attention captures correlations along different dimensions and incorporates hierarchical multi-hop interactions, which is efficient and scalable.\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This mechanism learns and leverages intrinsic sparsity in attention, allowing it to be integrated into existing LLMs. It customizes the FlashAttention kernel to extract block-wise attention maps, which is crucial for efficient long-context modeling.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\n\n- **Sparse Attention Patterns**: Methods like SeerAttention and other sparse attention mechanisms (e.g., Reformer, BiFormer, DAT) reduce memory usage by skipping unimportant blocks and using block-sparse kernels. SeerAttention, for instance, achieves significant speedup with up to 90% sparsity.\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: Techniques such as tensorized attention and SeerAttention use block-based processing to reduce memory requirements. This approach hierarchically merges interactions from low to high levels, avoiding the need for additional global or recurrent modules.\n\n## Hardware Acceleration Strategies\n\n- **Memristor-Based Acceleration**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing can accelerate transformer self-attention calculations. This design leverages analog matrix operations in a memristor crossbar array, reducing power consumption and improving efficiency.\n\n- **Custom Triton Kernels**: Tensorized attention is implemented with an efficient custom Triton kernel, which can be adapted from pre-trained LLMs. This kernel significantly reduces running time compared to full attention implementations.\n\n## Real-World Performance Metrics\n\n- **Performance on Long Sequences**: Tensorized attention has been evaluated on tasks with longer sequences and shows consistent performance improvements. It outperforms full attention in models like OpenLlama-3B and achieves comparable results on Mistral-7B and Llama-8B, with lower perplexity as sequence length increases.\n\n- **Speedup and Efficiency**: SeerAttention demonstrates a speedup of up to 5.67\u00d7 over FlashAttention-2 at a context size of 32k with 90% sparsity. It also shows a speedup of 5.47\u00d7 at a sequence length of 128k, highlighting its efficiency in real-world scenarios.\n\n## Continuous Attention Dynamics\n\n- **ODE-Based Models**: While the specific papers mentioned do not directly discuss ODE-based continuous attention dynamics, the concept of using ODEs for modeling smooth transitions in attention patterns is relevant. Integrating ODEs with the mentioned hardware-efficient attention mechanisms could provide a theoretical foundation for length extrapolation and efficient gradient computation, as suggested in your analysis.\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of memory and computation but also scalable and performant on long sequences.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/40 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\non p. 16).

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/54 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42(3):532-538, 1994.

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/45 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nHambly, B. and Lyons, T.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/59 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nApproximations of differential equations.

On the other hand, for a desired sequence of discrete times $t_{i}$, approximations to $x\\left(t_{0}\\right), x\\left(t_{1}\\right), \\ldots$ can be found by iterating the equation $x\\left(t_{i+1}\\right)=x\\left(t_{i}\\right)+\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}} f(s, x(s)) d s$. Different ways of approximating the RHS integral lead to different discretization schemes. We single out a discretization method called the generalized bilinear transform (GBT) which is specialized to linear ODEs of the form (1). Given a step size $\\Delta t$, the GBT update is\n\n$$\nx(t+\\Delta t)=(I-\\alpha \\Delta t \\cdot A)^{-1}(I+(1-\\alpha) \\Delta t \\cdot A) x(t)+\\Delta t(I-\\alpha \\Delta t \\cdot A)^{-1} B \\cdot u(t)\n$$\n\nThree important cases are: $\\alpha=0$ becomes the classic Euler method which is simply the first-order approximation $x(t+\\Delta t)=x(t)+\\Delta t \\cdot x^{\\prime}(t) ; \\alpha=1$ is called the backward Euler method; and $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$ is called the bilinear method, which preserves the stability of the system 61. In Section 3.2 we will show that the backward Euler method and Picard iteration are actually related to RNNs. On the other hand, the bilinear discretization will be our main method for computing accurate discrete-time approximations of our continuous-time models. In particular, define $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ to be the matrices appearing in $\\sqrt{3}$ for $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$. Then the discrete-time state-space model is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{t} & =\\bar{A} x_{t-1}+\\bar{B} u_{t} \\\\\ny_{t} & =C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\Delta t$ as a timescale. In most models, the length of dependencies they can capture is roughly proportional to $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$. Thus we also refer to the step size $\\Delta t$ as a timescale. This is an intrinsic part of converting a continuous-time ODE into a discrete-time recurrence, and most ODE-based RNN models have it as an important and non-trainable hyperparameter [24, 47, 58]. On the other hand, in Section 3.2 we show that the gating mechanism of classical RNNs is a version of learning $\\Delta t$. Moreover when viewed as a CNN, the timescale $\\Delta t$ can be viewed as controlling the width of the convolution kernel (Section 3.2). Ideally, all ODE-based sequence models would be able to automatically learn the proper timescales. Continuous-time memory. Consider an input function $u(t)$, a fixed probability measure $\\omega(t)$, and a sequence of $N$ basis functions such as polynomials. At every time $t$, the history of $u$ before time $t$ can be projected onto this basis, which yields a vector of coefficients $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that represents an optimal approximation of the history of $u$ with respect to the provided measure $\\omega$. The map taking the function $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to coefficients $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is called the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO) with respect to the measure $\\omega$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 17 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\", \"neural ODE stability analysis\", \"continuous model performance\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation using a real-world commercial dialog system in German.

Evaluating model performance under worst-case subpopulations\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous model performance\"*\n\n*Mike Li, Hongseok Namkoong, Shangzhou Xia*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a scalable yet principled two-stage estimation procedure that can evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art models and proves that the procedure enjoys several finite-sample convergence guarantees, including dimension-free convergence.\n\n**Abstract:** The performance of ML models degrades when the training population is different from that seen under operation. Towards assessing distributional robustness, we study the worst-case performance of a model over all subpopulations of a given size, defined with respect to core attributes Z. This notion of robustness can consider arbitrary (continuous) attributes Z, and automatically accounts for complex intersectionality in disadvantaged groups. We develop a scalable yet principled two-stage estimation procedure that can evaluate the robustness of state-of-the-art models. We prove that our procedure enjoys several finite-sample convergence guarantees, including dimension-free convergence. Instead of overly conservative notions based on Rademacher complexities, our evaluation error depends on the dimension of Z only through the out-of-sample error in estimating the performance conditional on Z. On real datasets, we demonstrate that our method certifies the robustness of a model and prevents deployment of unreliable models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Prefix-Tuning: Optimizing Continuous Prompts for Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous model performance\"*\n\n*Xiang Lisa Li, Percy Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Prefix-tuning is proposed, a lightweight alternative to fine- Tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which is called the prefix.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning is the de facto way of leveraging large pretrained language models for downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning modifies all the language model parameters and therefore necessitates storing a full copy for each task. In this paper, we propose prefix-tuning, a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning for natural language generation tasks, which keeps language model parameters frozen and instead optimizes a sequence of continuous task-specific vectors, which we call the prefix. Prefix-tuning draws inspiration from prompting for language models, allowing subsequent tokens to attend to this prefix as if it were \u201cvirtual tokens\u201d. We apply prefix-tuning to GPT-2 for table-to-text generation and to BART for summarization. We show that by learning only 0.1% of the parameters, prefix-tuning obtains comparable performance in the full data setting, outperforms fine-tuning in low-data settings, and extrapolates better to examples with topics that are unseen during training.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 3352  (*Influential: 363*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right\n  Productions\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\"*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank\nparameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial\nfor unsupervised parsing.

Representation Stability as a Regularizer for Improved Text Analytics\n  Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE stability analysis\"*\n\n*Matthew Riemer, Elham Khabiri, Richard Goodwin*\n\n**Abstract:** Although neural networks are well suited for sequential transfer learning\ntasks, the catastrophic forgetting problem hinders proper integration of prior\nknowledge. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem by using a\nmulti-task objective based on the idea of distillation and a mechanism that\ndirectly penalizes forgetting at the shared representation layer during the\nknowledge integration phase of training. We demonstrate our approach on a\nTwitter domain sentiment analysis task with sequential knowledge transfer from\nfour related tasks. We show that our technique outperforms networks fine-tuned\nto the target task. Additionally, we show both through empirical evidence and\nexamples that it does not forget useful knowledge from the source task that is\nforgotten during standard fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that first\ndistilling a human made rule based sentiment engine into a recurrent neural\nnetwork and then integrating the knowledge with the target task data leads to a\nsubstantial gain in generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate the\npower of multi-source transfer techniques in practical text analytics problems\nwhen paired with distillation. In particular, for the SemEval 2016 Task 4\nSubtask A (Nakov et al., 2016) dataset we surpass the state of the art\nestablished during the competition with a comparatively simple model\narchitecture that is not even competitive when trained on only the labeled task\nspecific data.\n\n**Published:** 2017-04-12T04:38:18Z  (*Updated: 2017-04-12T04:38:18Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Neighborhood-Regularized Self-Training for Learning with Few Labels\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE stability analysis\"*\n\n*Ran Xu, Yue Yu, Hejie Cui, Xuan Kan, Yanqiao Zhu, Joyce Ho, Chao Zhang, Carl Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with limited supervision has been a\npopular research topic as it can significantly alleviate the annotation burden.\nSelf-training has been successfully applied in semi-supervised learning tasks,\nbut one drawback of self-training is that it is vulnerable to the label noise\nfrom incorrect pseudo labels. Inspired by the fact that samples with similar\nlabels tend to share similar representations, we develop a neighborhood-based\nsample selection approach to tackle the issue of noisy pseudo labels. We\nfurther stabilize self-training via aggregating the predictions from different\nrounds during sample selection. Experiments on eight tasks show that our\nproposed method outperforms the strongest self-training baseline with 1.83% and\n2.51% performance gain for text and graph datasets on average.

In spite of its\nhigh efficiency, continual pretraining suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\nwhich may harm the model's performance in downstream tasks. To alleviate the\nissue, in this paper, we propose a continual pretraining method for the\nBERT-based model, named Attention-FFN Adapter. Its main idea is to introduce a\nsmall number of attention heads and hidden units inside each self-attention\nlayer and feed-forward network.

Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\"*\n\n*Ivana Kaji\u0107, Chris Eliasmith, Aaron Voelker*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\\mathcal{O}( d / \\sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Joint Design of RF and gradient waveforms via auto-differentiation for 3D tailored excitation in MRI\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient ODE implementation\"*\n\n*Jon-Fredrik Nielsen, Tianrui Luo, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Douglas C. Noll*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a new method for joint design of radiofrequency (RF) and gradient waveforms in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and applies it to the design of 3D spatially tailored saturation and inversion pulses. The joint design of both waveforms is characterized by the ODE Bloch equations, to which there is no known direct solution. Existing approaches therefore typically rely on simplified problem formulations based on, e.g., the small-tip approximation or constraining the gradient waveforms to particular shapes, and often apply only to specific objective functions for a narrow set of design goals (e.g., ignoring hardware constraints). This paper develops and exploits an auto-differentiable Bloch simulator to directly compute Jacobians of the (Bloch-simulated) excitation pattern with respect to RF and gradient waveforms. This approach is compatible with \\emph{arbitrary} sub-differentiable loss functions, and optimizes the RF and gradients directly without restricting the waveform shapes. For computational efficiency, we derive and implement explicit Bloch simulator Jacobians (approximately halving computation time and memory usage). To enforce hardware limits (peak RF, gradient, and slew rate), we use a change of variables that makes the 3D pulse design problem effectively unconstrained; we then optimize the resulting problem directly using the proposed auto-differentiation framework. We demonstrate our approach with two kinds of 3D excitation pulses that cannot be easily designed with conventional approaches: Outer-volume saturation (90{\\deg} flip angle), and inner-volume inversion.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Stable Neural ODE with Lyapunov-Stable Equilibrium Points for Defending Against Adversarial Attacks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE stability analysis\"*\n\n*Wee Peng Tay, Qinxu Ding, Yang song, Qiyu Kang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) are well-known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious human-imperceptible perturbations are included in the input to the deep network to fool it into making a wrong classification. Recent studies have demonstrated that neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are intrinsically more robust against adversarial attacks compared to vanilla DNNs. In this work, we propose a stable neural ODE with Lyapunov-stable equilibrium points for defending against adversarial attacks (SODEF). By ensuring that the equilibrium points of the ODE solution used as part of SODEF is Lyapunov-stable, the ODE solution for an input with a small perturbation converges to the same solution as the unperturbed input. We provide theoretical results that give insights into the stability of SODEF as well as the choice of regularizers to ensure its stability. Our analysis suggests that our proposed regularizers force the extracted feature points to be within a neighborhood of the Lyapunov-stable equilibrium points of the ODE. SODEF is compatible with many defense methods and can be applied to any neural network's final regressor layer to enhance its stability against adversarial attacks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. Interpolation between Residual and Non-Residual Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE stability analysis\"*\n\n*Chenglong Bao, Zonghan Yang, Zuoqiang Shi, Yang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Although ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide insights for designing network architectures, its relationship with the non-residual convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is still unclear. In this paper, we present a novel ODE model by adding a damping term. It can be shown that the proposed model can recover both a ResNet and a CNN by adjusting an interpolation coefficient. Therefore, the damped ODE model provides a unified framework for the interpretation of residual and non-residual networks. The Lyapunov analysis reveals better stability of the proposed model, and thus yields robustness improvement of the learned networks. Experiments on a number of image classification benchmarks show that the proposed model substantially improves the accuracy of ResNet and ResNeXt over the perturbed inputs from both stochastic noise and adversarial attack methods. Moreover, the loss landscape analysis demonstrates the improved robustness of our method along the attack direction.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Chain-of-Thought Hub: A Continuous Effort to Measure Large Language Models' Reasoning Performance\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous model performance\"*\n\n*Tushar Khot, Hao Peng, Yuhao Wan, Mingyu Chen, Litu Ou, Yao Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** As large language models (LLMs) are continuously being developed, their evaluation becomes increasingly important yet challenging. This work proposes Chain-of-Thought Hub, an open-source evaluation suite on the multi-step reasoning capabilities of large language models. We are interested in this setting for two reasons: (1) from the behavior of GPT and PaLM model family, we observe that complex reasoning is likely to be a key differentiator between weaker and stronger LLMs; (2) we envisage large language models to become the next-generation computational platform and foster an ecosystem of LLM-based new applications, this naturally requires the foundation models to perform complex tasks that often involve the composition of linguistic and logical operations. Our approach is to compile a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks to track the progress of LLMs. Our current results show that: (1) model scale clearly correlates with reasoning capabilities; (2) As of May 2023, Claude-v1.3 and PaLM-2 are the only two models that are comparable with GPT-4, while open-sourced models still lag behind; (3) LLaMA-65B performs closely to code-davinci-002, indicating that with successful further development such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it has great potential to be close to GPT-3.5-Turbo.

CARMA models fully account\nfor irregular sampling and measurement errors, making them valuable for\nquantifying variability, forecasting and interpolating light curves, and for\nvariability-based classification. We show that the PSD of a CARMA model can be\nexpressed as a sum of Lorentzian functions, which makes them extremely flexible\nand able to model a broad range of PSDs. We present the likelihood function for\nlight curves sampled from CARMA processes, placing them on a statistically\nrigorous foundation, and we present a Bayesian method to infer the probability\ndistribution of the PSD given the measured lightcurve. Because calculation of\nthe likelihood function scales linearly with the number of data points, CARMA\nmodeling scales to current and future massive time-domain data sets. We\nconclude by applying our CARMA modeling approach to light curves for an X-ray\nbinary, two AGN, a long-period variable star, and an RR-Lyrae star, in order to\nillustrate their use, applicability, and interpretation.\n\n**Published:** 2014-02-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), here are some key points and strategies derived from the analysis and the provided keywords:\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Neural ODEs\n\n- **Kernel Fusion and Optimization**: Techniques like those described in the context of GPU optimization can be applied to neural ODEs. For instance, using tools like `torch.compile` to fuse consecutive operations on the GPU can reduce kernel launch overhead and memory transfers, making the computation more efficient.\n- **Specialized Hardware**: Leveraging specialized hardware such as GPUs, TPUs, or even FPGAs can significantly improve the performance of neural ODEs. For example, integrating FPGA IP cores can provide customized and optimized hardware solutions for specific computational tasks, including ODE solving.\n\n### Stability Analysis Methods for Continuous-Time Models\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: Ensuring numerical stability in continuous-time models is crucial. This involves careful selection of ODE solvers and monitoring the stability of the solutions. Methods like adaptive step-size control and stability analysis frameworks can help in maintaining the stability of the model[Analysis Note: Technical Considerations].\n- **Depth-Adaptive Variants**: Models like the N-ODE Transformer, which are depth-adaptive and input-dependent, require careful stability analysis to ensure that the continuous dynamics do not lead to unstable behavior[Analysis Note: N-ODE Transformer].\n\n### Performance Benchmarks Comparing Continuous vs Discrete Approaches\n\n- **Empirical Comparisons**: Studies comparing the performance of continuous-time models (using neural ODEs) against discrete-time models (traditional transformers) are essential. Metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and computational efficiency should be evaluated. For example, the CLEX model demonstrates improved performance in handling varying sequence lengths using continuous dynamics[Analysis Note: CLEX].\n- **Efficiency Metrics**: Evaluating the energy efficiency and computational overhead of continuous models versus discrete models can provide insights into their practical applicability. Techniques like energy-aware prompting and optimization can be used to improve the efficiency of continuous models.\n\n### Memory Optimization Techniques for ODE-Based Models\n\n- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory management is critical for ODE-based models. Techniques such as fusing operations to reduce memory transfers, using cache systems effectively, and optimizing resource utilization can help in minimizing memory overhead.\n- **Data Processing in Larger Chunks**: Similar to the approach in energy-efficient code optimization, processing data in larger chunks can reduce memory traffic and improve overall efficiency. This can be particularly beneficial in ODE-based models where continuous data processing is involved.\n\n### Integration Strategies with Modern Hardware\n\n- **Hardware/Software Co-Design**: Implementing a hardware/software co-design approach can leverage the strengths of both hardware and software components.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 255  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale and enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/54 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42(3):532-538, 1994.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/40 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\non p. 16).

Stateful ODE-Nets using Basis Function Expansions\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE normalization\"*\n\n*A. Queiruga, N. Benjamin Erichson, Liam Hodgkinson, Michael W. Mahoney*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reconsider formulations of the weights as continuous-in-depth functions using linear combinations of basis functions which enables them to leverage parameter transformations such as function projections to formulate a novel stateful ODE-Block that handles stateful layers.\n\n**Abstract:** The recently-introduced class of ordinary differential equation networks (ODE-Nets) establishes a fruitful connection between deep learning and dynamical systems. In this work, we reconsider formulations of the weights as continuous-in-depth functions using linear combinations of basis functions which enables us to leverage parameter transformations such as function projections. In turn, this view allows us to formulate a novel stateful ODE-Block that handles stateful layers. The benefits of this new ODE-Block are twofold: first, it enables incorporating meaningful continuous-in-depth batch normalization layers to achieve state-of-the-art performance; second, it enables compressing the weights through a change of basis, without retraining, while maintaining near state-of-the-art performance and reducing both inference time and memory footprint. Performance is demonstrated by applying our stateful ODE-Block to (a) image classification tasks using convolutional units and (b) sentence-tagging tasks using transformer encoder units.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. IM-Loss: Information Maximization Loss for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE normalization\"*\n\n*Yu-Zhu Guo, Y. Chen, Liwen Zhang, Xiaode Liu, Yinglei Wang, Xuhui Huang, Zhe Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets show that the SNN models trained by the proposed IM-Loss outperform the current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Network (SNN), recognized as a type of biologically plausible architecture, has recently drawn much research attention. It transmits information by 0 / 1 spikes. This bio-mimetic mechanism of SNN demonstrates extreme energy efficiency since it avoids any multiplications on neuromorphic hardware. However, the forward-passing 0 / 1 spike quantization will cause information loss and accuracy degradation. To deal with this problem, the Information maximization loss (IM-Loss) that aims at maximizing the information flow in the SNN is proposed in the paper. The IM-Loss not only enhances the information expressiveness of an SNN directly but also plays a part of the role of normalization without introducing any additional operations ( e.g. , bias and scaling) in the inference phase. Additionally, we introduce a novel differentiable spike activity estimation, Evolutionary Surrogate Gradients (ESG) in SNNs. By appointing automatic evolvable surrogate gradients for spike activity function, ESG can ensure sufficient model updates at the beginning and accurate gradients at the end of the training, resulting in both easy convergence and high task performance. Experimental results on both popular non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets show that the SNN models trained by our method outperform the current state-of-the-art algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous adaptive normalization\"*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

Both of\ufb02ine A/B-testing and off-policy learning require a counterfactual estimator that evaluates how some new policy would have performed, if it had been used instead of the logging policy.

Most importantly, this analysis identi\ufb01es a new estimator \u2013 called Continuous Adaptive Blending (CAB) \u2013 which enjoys many advantageous theoretical and practical properties. In particular, it can be substantially less biased than clipped Inverse Propensity Score (IPS) weighting and the Direct Method, and it can have less variance than Doubly Robust and IPS estimators.

Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

Root Mean Square Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient layer normalization\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square, giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability and is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) has been successfully applied to various deep neural networks to help stabilize training and boost model convergence because of its capability in handling re-centering and re-scaling of both inputs and weight matrix. However, the computational overhead introduced by LayerNorm makes these improvements expensive and significantly slows the underlying network, e.g. RNN in particular. In this paper, we hypothesize that re-centering invariance in LayerNorm is dispensable and propose root mean square layer normalization, or RMSNorm. RMSNorm regularizes the summed inputs to a neuron in one layer according to root mean square (RMS), giving the model re-scaling invariance property and implicit learning rate adaptation ability. RMSNorm is computationally simpler and thus more efficient than LayerNorm. We also present partial RMSNorm, or pRMSNorm where the RMS is estimated from p% of the summed inputs without breaking the above properties. Extensive experiments on several tasks using diverse network architectures show that RMSNorm achieves comparable performance against LayerNorm but reduces the running time by 7%~64% on different models.

Structured Pruning for Efficient Generative Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient layer normalization\"*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Haoli Bai, Jiansheng Wei, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes S IMPLE, a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components and assigns learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training to identify redundant network structures.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing sizes of large generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) hinder their deployment in real-world applications. To obtain ef\ufb01cient PLMs, previous studies mostly focus on pruning the attention heads and feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the Transformer. Nevertheless, we \ufb01nd that in generative PLMs, the hidden dimension shared by many other modules (e.g., embedding layer and layer normalization) contains persistent outliers regardless of the network input. In this study, we propose S IMPLE , a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components. To identify redundant network structures, we assign learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training. Various sizes of PLMs can be \ufb02exibly extracted via different thresholds, and are then task-speci\ufb01cally \ufb01ne-tuned for further improvement. Extensive experiments on language modeling, summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. For example, the pruned BART brings 1.51x/6.96x inference speedup on GPU/CPU with 67% size reduction, and can be further combined with quantization for more than 25 \u00d7 compression.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient layer normalization\"*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE normalization\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2.

AF Adapter: Continual Pretraining for Building Chinese Biomedical\n  Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous adaptive normalization\"*\n\n*Yongyu Yan, Kui Xue, Xiaoming Shi, Qi Ye, Jingping Liu, Tong Ruan*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual pretraining is a popular way of building a domain-specific\npretrained language model from a general-domain language model. In spite of its\nhigh efficiency, continual pretraining suffers from catastrophic forgetting,\nwhich may harm the model's performance in downstream tasks. To alleviate the\nissue, in this paper, we propose a continual pretraining method for the\nBERT-based model, named Attention-FFN Adapter. Its main idea is to introduce a\nsmall number of attention heads and hidden units inside each self-attention\nlayer and feed-forward network. Furthermore, we train a domain-specific\nlanguage model named AF Adapter based RoBERTa for the Chinese biomedical\ndomain. In experiments, models are applied to downstream tasks for evaluation.\nThe results demonstrate that with only about 17% of model parameters trained,\nAF Adapter achieves 0.6%, 2% gain in performance on average, compared to strong\nbaselines.

Transformers have a mostly uniform backbone where layers\nalternate between feed-forward and self-attention in order to build a deep\nnetwork.

Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer,\nthat consists of a diverse sets of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward\nlayers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer\nnormalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality\nand efficiency.

However, its role for Ordinary Differential Equation based networks (neural ODEs) is still poorly understood. This paper investigates how different normalization techniques affect the performance of neural ODEs.

ANODE: Unconditionally Accurate Memory-Efficient Gradients for Neural ODEs\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE normalization\"*\n\n*George Biros, Kurt Keutzer, Amir Gholami*\n\n**Abstract:** Residual neural networks can be viewed as the forward Euler discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with a unit time step. This has recently motivated researchers to explore other discretization approaches and train ODE based networks. However, an important challenge of neural ODEs is their prohibitive memory cost during gradient backpropogation. Recently a method proposed in [8], claimed that this memory overhead can be reduced from O(LN_t), where N_t is the number of time steps, down to O(L) by solving forward ODE backwards in time, where L is the depth of the network. However, we will show that this approach may lead to several problems: (i) it may be numerically unstable for ReLU/non-ReLU activations and general convolution operators, and (ii) the proposed optimize-then-discretize approach may lead to divergent training due to inconsistent gradients for small time step sizes. We discuss the underlying problems, and to address them we propose ANODE, an Adjoint based Neural ODE framework which avoids the numerical instability related problems noted above, and provides unconditionally accurate gradients. ANODE has a memory footprint of O(L) + O(N_t), with the same computational cost as reversing ODE solve. We furthermore, discuss a memory efficient algorithm which can further reduce this footprint with a trade-off of additional computational cost.

Overcoming Recency Bias of Normalization Statistics in Continual Learning: Balance and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous adaptive normalization\"*\n\n*Liping Jing, Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Zicheng Sun, Xingxing Zhang, Liyuan Wang, Yilin Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning entails learning a sequence of tasks and balancing their knowledge appropriately. With limited access to old training samples, much of the current work in deep neural networks has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting of old tasks in gradient-based optimization. However, the normalization layers provide an exception, as they are updated interdependently by the gradient and statistics of currently observed training samples, which require specialized strategies to mitigate recency bias. In this work, we focus on the most popular Batch Normalization (BN) and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning. Our analysis demonstrates the dilemma between balance and adaptation of BN statistics for incremental tasks, which potentially affects training stability and generalization. Targeting on these particular challenges, we propose Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages. By implementing BN in a continual learning fashion, our approach achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of benchmarks, particularly for the challenging yet realistic online scenarios (e.g., up to 7.68%, 6.86% and 4.26% on Split CIFAR-10, Split CIFAR-100 and Split Mini-ImageNet, respectively).

Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient layer normalization\"*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. I-BERT: Integer-only BERT Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient layer normalization\"*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer based models, like BERT and RoBERTa, have achieved state-of-the-art results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption are prohibitive efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While quantization can be a viable solution for this, previous work on quantizing Transformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which cannot efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing Tensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM processors. In this work, we propose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that quantizes the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on lightweight integer-only approximation methods for nonlinear operations, e.g., GELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end integer-only BERT inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate our approach on GLUE downstream tasks using RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that for both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as compared to the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary implementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4-4.0x for INT8 inference on a T4 GPU system as compared to FP32 inference. The framework has been developed in PyTorch and has been open-sourced.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using neural ODEs and adaptive normalization, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n## Neural ODE Integration in Normalization\n\n- **Neural ODEs** can be used to model continuous-time dynamics, which can be applied to normalization layers. For instance, neural ODEs can learn continuous-time dynamics by solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs), making them suitable for modeling normalization parameters as continuous processes.\n- The paper on \"Graph Neural Flows for Unveiling Systemic Interactions\" discusses how neural ODEs can be used in latent variable models and how they can be replaced by neural flows, which might offer more efficiency and avoid the need for numerical ODE solvers.\n\n## Continuous Adaptation Mechanism\n\n- **Continuous adaptation** can be achieved through neural ODEs by modeling the evolution of normalization parameters over time. This approach allows for smooth adaptation across different sequence lengths and distributions. The paper on \"Generalization of neural network models for complex networked dynamical systems\" shows how neural ODEs can handle irregularly sampled time series data and adapt to different dynamics, which could be beneficial for language models.\n- The concept of using neural ODEs for zero-shot transfer and adaptable control algorithms also hints at their potential for continuous adaptation in language models.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Claims\n\n- **Memory efficiency** is crucial, and neural ODEs can be optimized in this regard. For example, the use of neural flows instead of neural ODEs can remove the reliance on numerical ODE solvers, leading to computational efficiency and potentially lower memory requirements.\n- The paper on \"Graph Neural Flows\" highlights that their approach can learn systemic interactions efficiently, which might be adapted to reduce memory overhead in normalization layers.\n\n## Hardware Implementation\n\n- **Hardware optimization** for neural ODE computations is important. While the provided sources do not specifically address hardware optimization for normalization layers, it is implied that avoiding numerical ODE solvers (as in neural flows) can lead to more efficient computations, which would be beneficial for hardware implementation.\n- General considerations for optimizing deep learning models on hardware, such as using efficient parameterizations and minimizing the need for expensive computations, would also apply here.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Continuous Adaptation\n\n- **Stability analysis** is critical when using continuous adaptation mechanisms. The paper on \"Generalization of neural network models for complex networked dynamical systems\" discusses the generalization capacity and out-of-distribution detection for neural network models, including those using neural ODEs. It highlights the importance of statistical significance tests to identify regimes of good and poor generalization, which can be applied to ensure stability in continuous adaptation.\n\n### Implementation Details and Strategies\n\n- **Implementation details**: Neural ODEs can be integrated into normalization layers by defining the normalization parameters as functions that evolve according to ODEs. This involves using neural networks to define the system's derivatives and integrating these over time using ODE solvers or more efficient alternatives like neural flows.\n- **Memory efficiency strategies**: Efficient caching and parameter sharing can be explored. For example, using neural flows instead of neural ODEs can reduce the computational overhead and memory requirements associated with numerical ODE solvers.\n- **Hardware optimization techniques**: Optimizing the parameter evolution through ODE integration to minimize computational overhead is key. This can involve using more efficient algorithms and avoiding unnecessary computations, such as those associated with numerical ODE solvers.\n\n### Comparison with Existing Approaches\n\n- **Comparison with existing adaptive normalization methods**: The proposal's uniqueness lies in using neural ODEs for normalization in language models. Existing adaptive normalization methods, such as layer normalization and adaptive layer normalization, do not use continuous-time dynamics. The proposal needs to be compared against these methods in terms of computational overhead, stability, and memory efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researchers can better assess the novelty, feasibility, and practical implications of using neural ODEs in normalization layers for autoregressive language models.\n",

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/54 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nIEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 42(3):532-538, 1994.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/40 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\non p. 16).

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/45 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nHambly, B. and Lyons, T.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/54 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nW.

Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint Method for Gradient Estimation in Neural ODE\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE implementation efficiency\"*\n\n*Juntang Zhuang, N. Dvornek, Xiaoxiao Li, S. Tatikonda, X. Papademetris, J. Duncan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method is proposed: in automatic differentiation, ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode trajectory as the reverse- mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy, and ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) have recently attracted increasing attention; however, their empirical performance on benchmark tasks (e.g. image classification) are significantly inferior to discrete-layer models. We demonstrate an explanation for their poorer performance is the inaccuracy of existing gradient estimation methods: the adjoint method has numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method directly back-propagates through ODE solvers, but suffers from a redundantly deep computation graph when searching for the optimal stepsize. We propose the Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: in automatic differentiation, ACA applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods. Finally, in an example of the three-body problem, we show NODE with ACA can incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy.

Biros*\n\n**TL;DR:** Results are reported showing that the coupled ODE-based framework is indeed trainable, and that it achieves higher accuracy, compared to the baseline ResNet network and the recently-proposed Neural ODE approach.\n\n**Abstract:** It has been observed that residual networks can be viewed as the explicit Euler discretization of an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). This observation motivated the introduction of so-called Neural ODEs, in which other discretization schemes and/or adaptive time stepping techniques can be used to improve the performance of residual networks. Here, we propose \\OURS, which extends this approach by introducing a framework that allows ODE-based evolution for both the weights and the activations, in a coupled formulation. Such an approach provides more modeling flexibility, and it can help with generalization performance. We present the formulation of \\OURS, derive optimality conditions, and implement the coupled framework in PyTorch. We present empirical results using several different configurations of \\OURS, testing them on the CIFAR-10 dataset. We report results showing that our coupled ODE-based framework is indeed trainable, and that it achieves higher accuracy, compared to the baseline ResNet network and the recently-proposed Neural ODE approach.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. HOPE: High-order Graph ODE For Modeling Interacting Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE implementation efficiency\"*\n\n*Xiao Luo, Jingyang Yuan, Zijie Huang, Huiyu Jiang, Yifang Qin, Wei Ju, Ming Zhang, Yizhou Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel model named High-Order graPh ODE (HOPE) for learning from dynamic interaction data, which can be naturally represented as a graph and utilizes a second-order graph ODE function which models the dynamics for both nodes and edges in the latent space respectively, which enables efficient learning of long-term dependencies from complex dynamical systems.\n\n**Abstract:** Leading graph ordinary differential equation (ODE) models have offered generalized strategies to model interacting multi-agent dynamical systems in a data-driven approach. They typically consist of a temporal graph encoder to get the initial states and a neural ODE-based generative model to model the evolution of dynamical systems. However, existing methods have severe deficiencies in capacity and efficiency due to the failure to model high-order correlations in long-term temporal trends. To tackle this, in this paper, we propose a novel model named High-Order graPh ODE (HOPE) for learning from dynamic interaction data, which can be naturally represented as a graph. It first adopts a twin graph encoder to initialize the latent state representations of nodes and edges, which consists of two branches to capture spatio-temporal correlations in complementary manners. More importantly, our HOPE utilizes a second-order graph ODE function which models the dynamics for both nodes and edges in the latent space respectively, which enables efficient learning of long-term dependencies from complex dynamical systems. Experiment results on a variety of datasets demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Makadia, Vikas Sindhwani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel family of Neural ODEs with time-varying weights, where time-dependence is non-parametric, and the smoothness of weight trajectories can be explicitly controlled to allow a tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are elegant reinterpretations of deep networks where continuous time can replace the discrete notion of depth, ODE solvers perform forward propagation, and the adjoint method enables efficient, constant memory backpropagation. Neural ODEs are universal approximators only when they are non-autonomous, that is, the dynamics depends explicitly on time. We propose a novel family of Neural ODEs with time-varying weights, where time-dependence is non-parametric, and the smoothness of weight trajectories can be explicitly controlled to allow a tradeoff between expressiveness and efficiency. Using this enhanced expressiveness, we outperform previous Neural ODE variants in both speed and representational capacity, ultimately outperforming standard ResNet and CNN models on select image classification and video prediction tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, the numerical estimation of the gradient in the continuous case is not well solved: existing implementations of the adjoint method suffer from inaccuracy in reverse-time trajectory, while the naive method and the adaptive checkpoint adjoint method (ACA) have a memory cost that grows with integration time. In this project, based on the asynchronous leapfrog (ALF) solver, we propose the Memory-efficient ALF Integrator (MALI), which has a constant memory cost \\textit{w.r.t} number of solver steps in integration similar to the adjoint method, and guarantees accuracy in reverse-time trajectory (hence accuracy in gradient estimation). We validate MALI in various tasks: on image recognition tasks, to our knowledge, MALI is the first to enable feasible training of a Neural ODE on ImageNet and outperform a well-tuned ResNet, while existing methods fail due to either heavy memory burden or inaccuracy; for time series modeling, MALI significantly outperforms the adjoint method; and for continuous generative models, MALI achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

Memory Efficient Optimizers with 4-bit States\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient ODE solvers\"*\n\n*Bingrui Li, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work pushes optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments, and identifies a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solves this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizer states are a major source of memory consumption for training neural networks, limiting the maximum trainable model within given memory budget. Compressing the optimizer states from 32-bit floating points to lower bitwidth is promising to reduce the training memory footprint, while the current lowest achievable bitwidth is 8-bit. In this work, we push optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments. Specifically, we find that moments have complicated outlier patterns, that current block-wise quantization cannot accurately approximate. We use a smaller block size and propose to utilize both row-wise and column-wise information for better quantization. We further identify a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solve this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point. Our 4-bit optimizers are evaluated on a wide variety of benchmarks including natural language understanding, machine translation, image classification, and instruction tuning. On all the tasks our optimizers can achieve comparable accuracy with their full-precision counterparts, while enjoying better memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7.

In this paper, we interpret this approach from a game theoretical perspective . De\ufb01ning optimal solutions in domain-adversarial training as local Nash equilibria, we show that gradient descent in domain-adversarial training can violate the asymptotic convergence guarantees of the optimizer, oftentimes hindering the transfer performance. Our analysis leads us to replace gradient descent with high-order ODE solvers (i.e., Runge\u2013Kutta), for which we derive asymptotic convergence guarantees. This family of optimizers is signi\ufb01cantly more stable and allows more aggressive learning rates, leading to high performance gains when used as a drop-in replacement over standard optimizers. Our experiments show that in conjunction with state-of-the-art domain-adversarial methods, we achieve up to 3.5% improvement with less than half of training iterations.

N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE implementation efficiency\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

HLAT: High-quality Large Language Model Pre-trained on AWS Trainium\n\n*From Search Query: \"stable ODE training\"*\n\n*Haozheng Fan, Hao Zhou, Guangtai Huang, Parameswaran Raman, Xinwei Fu, Gaurav Gupta, Dhananjay Ram, Yida Wang, Jun Huan*\n\n**Abstract:** Getting large language models (LLMs) to perform well on the downstream tasks\nrequires pre-training over trillions of tokens. This typically demands a large\nnumber of powerful computational devices in addition to a stable distributed\ntraining framework to accelerate the training. The growing number of\napplications leveraging AI/ML had led to a scarcity of the expensive\nconventional accelerators (such as GPUs), which begs the need for the\nalternative specialized-accelerators that are scalable and cost-efficient. AWS\nTrainium is the second-generation machine learning accelerator that has been\npurposely built for training large deep learning models. Its corresponding\ninstance, Amazon EC2 trn1, is an alternative to GPU instances for LLM training.\nHowever, training LLMs with billions of parameters on trn1 is challenging due\nto its relatively nascent software ecosystem. In this paper, we showcase HLAT:\na 7 billion parameter decoder-only LLM pre-trained using trn1 instances over\n1.8 trillion tokens. The performance of HLAT is benchmarked against popular\nopen source baseline models including LLaMA and OpenLLaMA, which have been\ntrained on NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs, respectively. On various evaluation\ntasks, we show that HLAT achieves model quality on par with the baselines. We\nalso share the best practice of using the Neuron Distributed Training Library\n(NDTL), a customized distributed training library for AWS Trainium to achieve\nefficient training. Our work demonstrates that AWS Trainium powered by the NDTL\nis able to successfully pre-train state-of-the-art LLM models with high\nperformance and cost-effectiveness.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-16T15:02:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-16T15:02:46Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE implementation efficiency\"*\n\n*Ivana Kaji\u0107, Chris Eliasmith, Aaron Voelker*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\\mathcal{O}( d / \\sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Monotone operator equilibrium networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODE implementation efficiency\"*\n\n*J. Zico Kolter, Ezra Winston*\n\n**Abstract:** Implicit-depth models such as Deep Equilibrium Networks have recently been shown to match or exceed the performance of traditional deep networks while being much more memory efficient. However, these models suffer from unstable convergence to a solution and lack guarantees that a solution exists. On the other hand, Neural ODEs, another class of implicit-depth models, do guarantee existence of a unique solution but perform poorly compared with traditional networks. In this paper, we develop a new class of implicit-depth model based on the theory of monotone operators, the Monotone Operator Equilibrium Network (monDEQ). We show the close connection between finding the equilibrium point of an implicit network and solving a form of monotone operator splitting problem, which admits efficient solvers with guaranteed, stable convergence. We then develop a parameterization of the network which ensures that all operators remain monotone, which guarantees the existence of a unique equilibrium point. Finally, we show how to instantiate several versions of these models, and implement the resulting iterative solvers, for structured linear operators such as multi-scale convolutions. The resulting models vastly outperform the Neural ODE-based models while also being more computationally efficient.

Training Generative Adversarial Networks by Solving Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"stable ODE training\"*\n\n*Pushmeet Kohli, Timothy P. Lillicrap, Jeff Donahue, Andrew Brock, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Yan Wu, Chongli Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** The instability of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training has frequently been attributed to gradient descent. Consequently, recent methods have aimed to tailor the models and training procedures to stabilise the discrete updates. In contrast, we study the continuous-time dynamics induced by GAN training. Both theory and toy experiments suggest that these dynamics are in fact surprisingly stable. From this perspective, we hypothesise that instabilities in training GANs arise from the integration error in discretising the continuous dynamics. We experimentally verify that well-known ODE solvers (such as Runge-Kutta) can stabilise training - when combined with a regulariser that controls the integration error. Our approach represents a radical departure from previous methods which typically use adaptive optimisation and stabilisation techniques that constrain the functional space (e.g. Spectral Normalisation). Evaluation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet shows that our method outperforms several strong baselines, demonstrating its efficacy.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 4. LCM-LoRA: A Universal Stable-Diffusion Acceleration Module\n\n*From Search Query: \"stable ODE training\"*\n\n*Hang Zhao, Jian Li, Longbo Huang, Apolin\u00e1rio Passos, Patrick von Platen, Daniel Gu, Suraj Patil, Yiqin Tan, Simian Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) have achieved impressive performance in accelerating text-to-image generative tasks, producing high-quality images with minimal inference steps. LCMs are distilled from pre-trained latent diffusion models (LDMs), requiring only ~32 A100 GPU training hours. This report further extends LCMs' potential in two aspects: First, by applying LoRA distillation to Stable-Diffusion models including SD-V1.5, SSD-1B, and SDXL, we have expanded LCM's scope to larger models with significantly less memory consumption, achieving superior image generation quality. Second, we identify the LoRA parameters obtained through LCM distillation as a universal Stable-Diffusion acceleration module, named LCM-LoRA. LCM-LoRA can be directly plugged into various Stable-Diffusion fine-tuned models or LoRAs without training, thus representing a universally applicable accelerator for diverse image generation tasks. Compared with previous numerical PF-ODE solvers such as DDIM, DPM-Solver, LCM-LoRA can be viewed as a plug-in neural PF-ODE solver that possesses strong generalization abilities.

For example, the use of ODE solvers can be computationally intensive, especially for long sequences or complex systems.\n- The `NeuralPDE` package provides a practical example of how to implement neural ODEs using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve ODEs. This involves defining an `ODEProblem` and choosing a neural network architecture, such as a multilayer perceptron (MLP), and an optimizer like Adam.\n\n### Memory Optimization Techniques for ODE-Based Models\n\n- Neural ODEs are often more memory-efficient than deep RNNs or LSTMs because they only store the initial state and compute the solution on the fly using ODE solvers. This reduces the need to keep track of states across each step, which can be beneficial for large datasets.\n- However, the choice of ODE solver and the size of the memory module can significantly impact performance. For instance, increasing the memory module size can improve performance up to a point but may lead to overfitting or noise if the module becomes too large.\n\n### Training Stability Analysis for Neural ODEs\n\n- Training stability is a critical concern for neural ODEs. The computational overhead of ODE solvers can make training slower, and the continuous nature of these models can introduce instability. Careful selection of the ODE solver and hyperparameters is essential to maintain stability.\n- The paper on \"Efficient, Accurate and Stable Gradients for Neural ODEs\" discusses methods to improve the stability and efficiency of training neural ODEs, including techniques for computing gradients and optimizing the training process.\n\n### Integration of ODEs with Normalization Layers\n\n- While there is limited work specifically on integrating ODEs with normalization layers in language models, the concept of using ODEs for continuous adaptation in normalization layers shows promise. For example, \"Stateful ODE-Nets using Basis Function Expansions\" suggests incorporating meaningful continuous-in-depth batch normalization layers using ODEs[Analysis Note].\n- Integrating ODEs with existing normalization techniques, such as layer normalization or root mean square layer normalization, could provide better handling of varying sequence lengths and non-stationary data[Analysis Note].\n\n### Performance Comparisons Between ODE-Based and Traditional Approaches\n\n- Neural ODEs have been compared to traditional RNNs and LSTMs in various contexts. Neural ODEs excel in continuous time modeling and are more memory-efficient but can be computationally intensive and less suitable for real-time applications or tasks requiring long-range dependencies in a discrete context.\n- In the context of dynamical systems and time series prediction, neural ODEs have shown superior performance in capturing subtle nuances and handling irregularly sampled data compared to sequence-based models like RNNs and LSTMs.\n\n### Implementation Details and Code Examples\n\n- The `NeuralPDE` tutorial provides a detailed example of implementing neural ODEs using PINNs, including code snippets for defining the ODE problem, choosing a neural network architecture, and optimizing the parameters.\n\n### Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n- Storing only the initial state and using ODE solvers to generate the rest of the sequence as needed is a key strategy for memory efficiency. This approach contrasts with RNNs and LSTMs, which must keep track of states across each step.\n\n### Stability Analysis Methods\n\n- Stability analysis involves careful tuning of hyperparameters and the choice of ODE solvers. The paper on \"Efficient, Accurate and Stable Gradients for Neural ODEs\" provides insights into methods for improving stability during training.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can better design and implement neural ODE-based autoregressive language models that are efficient, stable, and perform well on various tasks.\n",

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture.

We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

First, we propose a simple layer named gated attention unit, which allows the use of a weaker single-head attention with minimal quality loss. We then propose a linear approximation method complementary to this new layer, which is accelerator-friendly and highly competitive in quality. The resulting model, named FLASH, matches the perplexity of improved Transformers over both short (512) and long (8K) context lengths, achieving training speedups of up to 4.9$\\times$ on Wiki-40B and 12.1$\\times$ on PG-19 for auto-regressive language modeling, and 4.8$\\times$ on C4 for masked language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 5156-5165.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1084  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 2. LipsNet: A Smooth and Robust Neural Network with Adaptive Lipschitz Constant for High Accuracy Optimal Control\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Xujie Song, Jingliang Duan, Wenxuan Wang, S.

Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a neural network named LipsNet, which addresses the action \ufb02uctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve as actor networks in most RL algorithms, making it more accessible and user-friendly than previous works.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for solving optimal control problems. However, RL-trained policies often suffer from the action \ufb02uctuation problem, where the consecutive actions signi\ufb01cantly differ despite only slight state variations. This problem results in mechanical components\u2019 wear and tear and poses safety hazards. The action \ufb02uctuation is caused by the high Lipschitz constant of actor networks. To address this problem, we pro-pose a neural network named LipsNet. We pro-pose the Multi-dimensional Gradient Normalization (MGN) method, to constrain the Lipschitz constant of networks with multi-dimensional input and output. Bene\ufb01ting from MGN, LipsNet achieves Lipschitz continuity, allowing smooth actions while preserving control performance by adjusting Lipschitz constant. LipsNet addresses the action \ufb02uctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve as actor networks in most RL algorithms, making it more \ufb02exible and user-friendly than previous works. Experiments demonstrate that LipsNet has good landscape smoothness and noise robustness, resulting in signi\ufb01cantly smoother action compared to the Multilayer Perceptron.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a simple and general method to train a single neural network executable at different widths, permitting instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime, and demonstrates better performance of slimmable models compared with individual ones across a wide range of applications.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a simple and general method to train a single neural network executable at different widths (number of channels in a layer), permitting instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Instead of training individual networks with different width configurations, we train a shared network with switchable batch normalization. At runtime, the network can adjust its width on the fly according to on-device benchmarks and resource constraints, rather than downloading and offloading different models. Our trained networks, named slimmable neural networks, achieve similar (and in many cases better) ImageNet classification accuracy than individually trained models of MobileNet v1, MobileNet v2, ShuffleNet and ResNet-50 at different widths respectively. We also demonstrate better performance of slimmable models compared with individual ones across a wide range of applications including COCO bounding-box object detection, instance segmentation and person keypoint detection without tuning hyper-parameters. Lastly we visualize and discuss the learned features of slimmable networks.

ODE Transformer: An Ordinary Differential Equation-Inspired Model for Sequence Generation\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Bei Li, Quan Du, Tao Zhou, Yi Jing, Shuhan Zhou, Xin Zeng, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu, Xuebo Liu, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new architecture is designed, ODE Transformer, which is analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODE, and can gain large improvements in model performance over strong baselines at a slight cost in inference efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Residual networks are an Euler discretization of solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). This paper explores a deeper relationship between Transformer and numerical ODE methods. We first show that a residual block of layers in Transformer can be described as a higher-order solution to ODE. Inspired by this, we design a new architecture, ODE Transformer, which is analogous to the Runge-Kutta method that is well motivated in ODE. As a natural extension to Transformer, ODE Transformer is easy to implement and efficient to use. Experimental results on the large-scale machine translation, abstractive summarization, and grammar error correction tasks demonstrate the high genericity of ODE Transformer. It can gain large improvements in model performance over strong baselines (e.g., 30.77 and 44.11 BLEU scores on the WMT\u201914 English-German and English-French benchmarks) at a slight cost in inference efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

Transformer-based Planning for Symbolic Regression\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Parshin Shojaee, Kazem Meidani, A. Farimani, Chandan K. Reddy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fitting-complexity trade-off, extrapolation abilities, and robustness to noise.\n\n**Abstract:** Symbolic regression (SR) is a challenging task in machine learning that involves finding a mathematical expression for a function based on its values. Recent advancements in SR have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-trained transformer-based models in generating equations as sequences, leveraging large-scale pre-training on synthetic datasets and offering notable advantages in terms of inference time over classical Genetic Programming (GP) methods. However, these models primarily rely on supervised pre-training goals borrowed from text generation and overlook equation discovery objectives like accuracy and complexity. To address this, we propose TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process. Unlike conventional decoding strategies, TPSR enables the integration of non-differentiable feedback, such as fitting accuracy and complexity, as external sources of knowledge into the transformer-based equation generation process. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the model's fitting-complexity trade-off, extrapolation abilities, and robustness to noise.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Linguistically Motivated Sign Language Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Amit Moryossef, Zifan Jiang, Mathias Muller, Sarah Ebling, Yoav Goldberg*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces the predominant IO tagging scheme with BIO tagging to account for continuous signing, and observes that including optical flow and 3D hand normalization enhances the robustness of the model in this context.\n\n**Abstract:** Sign language segmentation is a crucial task in sign language processing systems. It enables downstream tasks such as sign recognition, transcription, and machine translation. In this work, we consider two kinds of segmentation: segmentation into individual signs and segmentation into phrases, larger units comprising several signs. We propose a novel approach to jointly model these two tasks. Our method is motivated by linguistic cues observed in sign language corpora. We replace the predominant IO tagging scheme with BIO tagging to account for continuous signing. Given that prosody plays a significant role in phrase boundaries, we explore the use of optical flow features. We also provide an extensive analysis of hand shapes and 3D hand normalization. We find that introducing BIO tagging is necessary to model sign boundaries. Explicitly encoding prosody by optical flow improves segmentation in shallow models, but its contribution is negligible in deeper models. Careful tuning of the decoding algorithm atop the models further improves the segmentation quality. We demonstrate that our final models generalize to out-of-domain video content in a different signed language, even under a zero-shot setting. We observe that including optical flow and 3D hand normalization enhances the robustness of the model in this context.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. CLEX: Continuous Length Extrapolation for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Guanzheng Chen, Xin Li, Zaiqiao Meng, Shangsong Liang, Li Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) is proposed, which generalises the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are pioneering advances in many natural language processing tasks, however, their exceptional capabilities are restricted within the preset context window of Transformer. Position Embedding (PE) scaling methods, while effective in extending the context window to a specific length, demonstrate either notable limitations in their extrapolation abilities or sacrificing partial performance within the context window. Length extrapolation methods, although theoretically capable of extending the context window beyond the training sequence length, often underperform in practical long-context applications. To address these challenges, we propose Continuous Length EXtrapolation (CLEX) for LLMs. We generalise the PE scaling approaches to model the continuous dynamics by ordinary differential equations over the length scaling factor, thereby overcoming the constraints of current PE scaling methods designed for specific lengths. Moreover, by extending the dynamics to desired context lengths beyond the training sequence length, CLEX facilitates the length extrapolation with impressive performance in practical tasks. We demonstrate that CLEX can be seamlessly incorporated into LLMs equipped with Rotary Position Embedding, such as LLaMA and GPT-NeoX, with negligible impact on training and inference latency. Experimental results reveal that CLEX can effectively extend the context window to over 4x or almost 8x training length, with no deterioration in performance. Furthermore, when evaluated on the practical LongBench benchmark, our model trained on a 4k length exhibits competitive performance against state-of-the-art open-source models trained on context lengths up to 32k.

Test-Time Distribution Normalization for Contrastively Learned Visual-language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Yi Zhou, Juntao Ren, Fengyu Li, Ramin Zabih, S. Lim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Distribution Normalization (DN) is proposed, where the mean representation of a batch of test samples is approximate and used to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss, which requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Advances in the field of vision-language contrastive learning have made it possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently known as CLIP has garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This paper reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should also be in alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative samples information during inference in a computationally efficient way. To this end, we propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear advantage of DN over the dot product on top of other existing test-time augmentation methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Layer Normalization for Adaptive Neural Acoustic Modeling in\n  Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Taesup Kim, Inchul Song, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization is a recently introduced technique for normalizing the\nactivities of neurons in deep neural networks to improve the training speed and\nstability. In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Training Integer-Only Deep Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Vahid Partovi Nia, Eyy\u00fcb Sari, Vanessa Courville, Masoud Asgharian*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the backbone of many text and speech\napplications. These architectures are typically made up of several\ncomputationally complex components such as; non-linear activation functions,\nnormalization, bi-directional dependence and attention. In order to maintain\ngood accuracy, these components are frequently run using full-precision\nfloating-point computation, making them slow, inefficient and difficult to\ndeploy on edge devices. In addition, the complex nature of these operations\nmakes them challenging to quantize using standard quantization methods without\na significant performance drop.

Unveiling LLM Mechanisms Through Neural ODEs and Control Theory\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Yukun Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** This study presents a novel approach that leverages Neural Ordinary\nDifferential Equations (Neural ODEs) to unravel the intricate relationships\nbetween inputs and outputs in Large Language Models (LLMs), and employs robust\ncontrol to fine-tune outputs to meet predefined standards. Central to our\nmethodology is the transformation of LLM inputs and outputs into a\nlower-dimensional latent space, facilitating a detailed examination of the\ninformation processing pathways within LLMs. Neural ODEs play a pivotal role in\nthis investigation by providing a dynamic model that captures the continuous\nevolution of data within the LLMs. Additionally, robust control mechanisms are\napplied to strategically adjust the model's outputs, ensuring they not only\nmaintain high quality and reliability but also adhere to specific performance\ncriteria.

N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. LLMs Plagiarize: Ensuring Responsible Sourcing of Large Language Model\n  Training Data Through Knowledge Graph Comparison\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Devam Mondal, Carlo Lipizzi*\n\n**Abstract:** In light of recent legal allegations brought by publishers, newspapers, and\nother creators of copyrighted corpora against large language model developers\nwho use their copyrighted materials for training or fine-tuning purposes, we\npropose a novel system, a variant of a plagiarism detection system, that\nassesses whether a knowledge source has been used in the training or\nfine-tuning of a large language model. Unlike current methods, we utilize an\napproach that uses Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples to create\nknowledge graphs from both a source document and an LLM continuation of that\ndocument. These graphs are then analyzed with respect to content using cosine\nsimilarity and with respect to structure using a normalized version of graph\nedit distance that shows the degree of isomorphism. Unlike traditional\nplagiarism systems that focus on content matching and keyword identification\nbetween a source and a target corpus, our approach enables a broader and more\naccurate evaluation of similarity between a source document and LLM\ncontinuation by focusing on relationships between ideas and their organization\nwith regards to others. Additionally, our approach does not require access to\nLLM metrics like perplexity that may be unavailable in closed large language\nmodel \"black-box\" systems, as well as the training corpus. We thus assess\nwhether an LLM has \"plagiarized\" a corpus in its continuation through\nsimilarity measures.

Learning Deep Transformer Models for Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Qiang Wang, Bei Li, Tong Xiao, Jingbo Zhu, Changliang Li, Derek F. Wong, Lidia S. Chao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is the state-of-the-art model in recent machine translation\nevaluations. Two strands of research are promising to improve models of this\nkind: the first uses wide networks (a.k.a. Transformer-Big) and has been the de\nfacto standard for the development of the Transformer system, and the other\nuses deeper language representation but faces the difficulty arising from\nlearning deep networks. Here, we continue the line of research on the latter.\nWe claim that a truly deep Transformer model can surpass the Transformer-Big\ncounterpart by 1) proper use of layer normalization and 2) a novel way of\npassing the combination of previous layers to the next. On WMT'16 English-\nGerman, NIST OpenMT'12 Chinese-English and larger WMT'18 Chinese-English tasks,\nour deep system (30/25-layer encoder) outperforms the shallow\nTransformer-Big/Base baseline (6-layer encoder) by 0.4-2.4 BLEU points.

Batch-Instance Normalization for Adaptively Style-Invariant Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Hyo-Eun Kim, Hyeonseob Nam*\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world image recognition is often challenged by the variability of visual\nstyles including object textures, lighting conditions, filter effects, etc.\nAlthough these variations have been deemed to be implicitly handled by more\ntraining data and deeper networks, recent advances in image style transfer\nsuggest that it is also possible to explicitly manipulate the style\ninformation. Extending this idea to general visual recognition problems, we\npresent Batch-Instance Normalization (BIN) to explicitly normalize unnecessary\nstyles from images. Considering certain style features play an essential role\nin discriminative tasks, BIN learns to selectively normalize only disturbing\nstyles while preserving useful styles. The proposed normalization module is\neasily incorporated into existing network architectures such as Residual\nNetworks, and surprisingly improves the recognition performance in various\nscenarios. Furthermore, experiments verify that BIN effectively adapts to\ncompletely different tasks like object classification and style transfer, by\ncontrolling the trade-off between preserving and removing style variations.

Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Preprocessing Time Series Data for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive normalization neural networks\"*\n\n*Anton Hinel, Leonie Goldmann, Francesco Sanna Passino, Marcus A. K. September*\n\n**Abstract:** Data preprocessing is a crucial part of any machine learning pipeline, and it can have a significant impact on both performance and training efficiency. This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series preprocessing layers.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. AudioLCM: Text-to-Audio Generation with Latent Consistency Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Zhou Zhao, Siqi Zheng, Xize Cheng, Jialei Wang, Hengyuan Cao, Yang Liu, Rongjie Huang, Huadai Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have propelled them to the forefront of various generative tasks. However, their iterative sampling process poses a significant computational burden, resulting in slow generation speeds and limiting their application in text-to-audio generation deployment. In this work, we introduce AudioLCM, a novel consistency-based model tailored for efficient and high-quality text-to-audio generation. AudioLCM integrates Consistency Models into the generation process, facilitating rapid inference through a mapping from any point at any time step to the trajectory's initial point. To overcome the convergence issue inherent in LDMs with reduced sample iterations, we propose the Guided Latent Consistency Distillation with a multi-step Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. This innovation shortens the time schedule from thousands to dozens of steps while maintaining sample quality, thereby achieving fast convergence and high-quality generation. Furthermore, to optimize the performance of transformer-based neural network architectures, we integrate the advanced techniques pioneered by LLaMA into the foundational framework of transformers. This architecture supports stable and efficient training, ensuring robust performance in text-to-audio synthesis. Experimental results on text-to-sound generation and text-to-music synthesis tasks demonstrate that AudioLCM needs only 2 iterations to synthesize high-fidelity audios, while it maintains sample quality competitive with state-of-the-art models using hundreds of steps. AudioLCM enables a sampling speed of 333x faster than real-time on a single NVIDIA 4090Ti GPU, making generative models practically applicable to text-to-audio generation deployment. Our extensive preliminary analysis shows that each design in AudioLCM is effective.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Finite Elements with Switch Detection for Direct Optimal Control of Nonsmooth Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"transformer ODE integration\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces Finite Elements with Switch Detection (FESD), a numerical discretization method for nonsmooth differential equations. We consider the Filippov convexification of these systems and a transformation into dynamic complementarity systems introduced by [Stewart, 1990]. FESD is based on solving nonlinear complementarity problems and can automatically detect nonsmooth events in time. If standard time-stepping Runge-Kutta (RK) methods are naively applied to a nonsmooth ODE, the accuracy is at best of order one. In FESD, we let the integrator step size be a degree of freedom. Additional complementarity conditions, which we call cross complementarities, enable exact switch detection, hence FESD can recover the high order accuracy that the RK methods enjoy for smooth ODE. Additional conditions called step equilibration allow the step size to change only when switches occur and thus avoid spurious degrees of freedom. Convergence results for the FESD method are derived, local uniqueness of the solution and convergence of numerical sensitivities are proven. The efficacy of FESD is demonstrated in several simulation and optimal control examples. In an optimal control problem benchmark with FESD, we achieve up to five orders of magnitude more accurate solutions than a standard time-stepping approach for the same computational time.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-11\n\n\n\n#### 5. P-Tuning v2: Prompt Tuning Can Be Comparable to Fine-tuning Universally Across Scales and Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Jie Tang, Zhilin Yang, Zhengxiao Du, Weng Lam Tam, Yicheng Fu, Kaixuan Ji, Xiao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt tuning, which only tunes continuous prompts with a frozen language model, substantially reduces per-task storage and memory usage at training. However, in the context of NLU, prior work reveals that prompt tuning does not perform well for normal-sized pretrained models. We also find that existing methods of prompt tuning cannot handle hard sequence labeling tasks, indicating a lack of universality. We present a novel empirical finding that properly optimized prompt tuning can be universally effective across a wide range of model scales and NLU tasks. It matches the performance of finetuning while having only 0.1%-3% tuned parameters. Our method P-Tuning v2 is an implementation of Deep Prompt Tuning \\cite{li2021prefix,qin2021learning} optimized and adapted for NLU. Given the universality and simplicity of P-Tuning v2, we believe it can serve as an alternative to finetuning and a strong baseline for future research.Our code and data are released at https://github.com/THUDM/P-tuning-v2.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 6. Discrete Flows: Invertible Generative Models of Discrete Data\n\n*From Search Query: \"continuous normalization language models\"*\n\n*Laurent Dinh, Kumar Krishna Agrawal, Keyon Vafa, Dustin Tran, Ben Poole*\n\n**Abstract:** While normalizing flows have led to significant advances in modeling high-dimensional continuous distributions, their applicability to discrete distributions remains unknown. In this paper, we show that flows can in fact be extended to discrete events---and under a simple change-of-variables formula not requiring log-determinant-Jacobian computations. Discrete flows have numerous applications. We consider two flow architectures: discrete autoregressive flows that enable bidirectionality, allowing, for example, tokens in text to depend on both left-to-right and right-to-left contexts in an exact language model; and discrete bipartite flows that enable efficient non-autoregressive generation as in RealNVP. Empirically, we find that discrete autoregressive flows outperform autoregressive baselines on synthetic discrete distributions, an addition task, and Potts models; and bipartite flows can obtain competitive performance with autoregressive baselines on character-level language modeling for Penn Tree Bank and text8.\n\n**Conference:** discrete-flows-invertible-generative-models-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design using the specified keywords and focus areas, here are some key findings and suggestions from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Applications of Adaptive Normalization in Neural Networks\n\n- Adaptive normalization techniques are crucial for improving the robustness and performance of neural networks, especially in heterogeneous data settings. For instance, the paper on Adaptive Normalization-Free Feature Recalibration (ANFR) discusses how combining weight standardization with channel attention can enhance model performance by suppressing inconsistent features and emphasizing shared, informative features across clients. This approach is particularly useful in federated learning scenarios where data heterogeneity is a significant challenge.\n\n## Integration of ODEs with Transformer Architectures\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of ODEs with transformer architectures, previous research has explored this area. For example, the concept of \"ODE Transformer\" involves using ordinary differential equations to model the continuous dynamics within transformer layers. This approach can potentially improve the efficiency and expressiveness of transformer models by allowing continuous-time transformations, which can be particularly beneficial for sequence-to-sequence tasks and language modeling (referenced in the analysis note).\n\n## Continuous-Time Approaches to Normalization in Language Models\n\n- Continuous-time approaches, such as those involving neural ODEs, can be integrated with normalization techniques to improve stability and efficiency. However, the provided sources do not specifically address continuous-time normalization in language models. Instead, they focus on general normalization techniques and their applications. For continuous-time normalization, researchers might need to explore how adaptive normalization methods (like those discussed in and) can be adapted for continuous-time models, ensuring stability and efficiency.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Traditional and Continuous Normalization\n\n- Performance comparisons between traditional and continuous normalization methods are crucial. Traditional normalization methods like batch normalization can stabilize the training process but may not be as effective in continuous-time models. Adaptive normalization methods, as discussed in, can offer better performance under data heterogeneity and might be more suitable for continuous-time models. However, specific empirical comparisons in the context of language models would require further research.\n\n## Implementation Details of Adaptive Normalization\n\n- Implementation details of adaptive normalization involve careful consideration of the normalization technique used. For example, weight standardization instead of activation normalization can be more robust under data heterogeneity. Channel attention mechanisms can also be integrated to produce learnable scaling factors for feature maps, which helps in suppressing inconsistent features and emphasizing relevant ones.\n\n### Practical Implementation Details and Performance Metrics\n\n- **Practical Implementation**: When implementing adaptive normalization in neural networks, it is important to consider the computational and memory efficiency. Techniques like weight standardization and channel attention can be integrated into existing architectures with minimal computational overhead.\n- **Performance Metrics**: Performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs should be evaluated. The ANFR approach, for instance, has been shown to enhance class selectivity and optimize channel attention weight distribution, leading to better performance under data heterogeneity.\n\n### Integration Strategies with Existing Architectures\n\n- **Integration with Transformers**: Integrating adaptive normalization with transformer architectures can involve replacing traditional normalization layers with adaptive ones. For example, using weight standardization instead of batch normalization can improve the model's robustness and performance. Additionally, incorporating channel attention mechanisms can further enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant features.\n\n### Stability Analysis\n\n- **Stability Considerations**: Stability is a critical aspect when integrating ODEs or continuous-time models with normalization techniques. Ensuring numerical stability during training is essential, and methods like MALI and ACA can be useful in managing the memory-computation trade-off and ensuring accurate gradient computation[Analysis Note].\n\n### Memory and Computational Efficiency\n\n- **Efficiency**: Adaptive normalization techniques can be designed to be computationally efficient. For instance, weight standardization does not depend on mini-batch statistics, making it less computationally intensive compared to batch normalization. However, integrating these techniques with ODEs or continuous-time models may introduce additional computational overhead, which needs to be managed through techniques like adaptive checkpointing[Analysis Note].\n\nTo further improve autoregressive language model design, the researchers should:\n\n- Explore the integration of ODEs with transformer architectures, focusing on how continuous-time transformations can enhance model expressiveness and efficiency.\n- Conduct empirical comparisons between traditional and continuous normalization methods in language models to identify the most effective approach.\n- Implement adaptive normalization techniques, such as weight standardization and channel attention, within transformer-based language models to improve robustness and performance.\n- Ensure stability and efficiency by carefully managing the memory-computation trade-off and using techniques like MALI and ACA for accurate gradient computation.\n",

While techniques like RMSNorm provide computational benefits, they lack the ability to smoothly adapt to changing contexts and sequence lengths. This limitation becomes particularly apparent in scenarios requiring length extrapolation or handling diverse input distributions. Additionally, existing normalization approaches often struggle to maintain consistent performance across different scales of the input, leading to potential instability during training and inference.\n\n## Related Work\n\nRecent advances in neural ODEs, continuous modeling, and efficient hardware implementations have opened new possibilities for enhancing normalization in language models:\n\n1. **Continuous Length Extrapolation**:\n   - CLEX (Chen et al., 2023) demonstrates the effectiveness of ODE-based approaches for modeling continuous dynamics in position embeddings\n   - Shows potential for smooth adaptation across different sequence lengths\n\n2. **Efficient Hardware Implementation**:\n   - FlashFFTConv (Fu et al., 2023) provides insights into hardware-efficient implementations of continuous operations\n   - Demonstrates the importance of memory hierarchy and hardware utilization\n\n3. **Adaptive Normalization**:\n   - Lightning Attention-2 (Qin et al., 2024) shows the benefits of efficient implementation strategies\n   - Highlights the importance of hardware-aware design for performance\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nCurrent normalization techniques face several key challenges:\n\n1. **Discrete Nature**: Traditional normalization methods operate discretely, lacking smooth transitions across different scales and contexts.\n\n2. **Limited Adaptability**: Fixed normalization parameters cannot efficiently handle varying input distributions and sequence lengths.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**: Naive implementations of adaptive normalization can introduce significant computational overhead.\n\n4. **Memory Management**: Dynamic parameter generation needs careful design to maintain memory efficiency.\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nODEAdaptGPT introduces ODERMSNorm, a novel normalization approach that models normalization parameters as continuous dynamics using neural ODEs.
