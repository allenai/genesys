In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance.

As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

At its heart is the attention mechanism, which enables effective modeling of long-term dependencies in a sequence. Recently, transformers have been successfully applied in the computer vision domain, where 2D images are first segmented into patches and then treated as 1D sequences. Such linearization, however, impairs the notion of spatial locality in images, which bears important visual clues. To bridge the gap, we propose ripple attention, a sub-quadratic attention mechanism for vision transformers. Built upon the recent kernel-based efficient attention mechanisms, we design a novel dynamic programming algorithm that weights contributions of different tokens to a query with respect to their relative spatial distances in the 2D space in linear observed time. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ripple attention on various visual tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. You Only Sample (Almost) Once: Linear Cost Self-Attention Via Bernoulli Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism linear complexity*\n\n*Zhanpeng Zeng, Yunyang Xiong, Sathya Ravi, Shailesh Acharya, G. Fung, Vikas Singh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models are widely used in natural language processing (NLP). Central to the transformer model is the self-attention mechanism, which captures the interactions of token pairs in the input sequences and depends quadratically on the sequence length. Training such models on longer sequences is expensive. In this paper, we show that a Bernoulli sampling attention mechanism based on Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), decreases the quadratic complexity of such models to linear. We bypass the quadratic cost by considering self-attention as a sum of individual tokens associated with Bernoulli random variables that can, in principle, be sampled at once by a single hash (although in practice, this number may be a small constant). This leads to an efficient sampling scheme to estimate self-attention which relies on specific modifications of LSH (to enable deployment on GPU architectures). We evaluate our algorithm on the GLUE benchmark with standard 512 sequence length where we see favorable performance relative to a standard pretrained Transformer. On the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, for evaluating performance on long sequences, our method achieves results consistent with softmax self-attention but with sizable speed-ups and memory savings and often outperforms other efficient self-attention methods.

Yet for real-time semantic segmentation, pure CNN-based approaches still dominate in this field, due to the time-consuming computation mechanism of transformer. We propose RTFormer, an efficient dual-resolution transformer for real-time semantic segmenation, which achieves better trade-off between performance and efficiency than CNN-based models. To achieve high inference efficiency on GPU-like devices, our RTFormer leverages GPU-Friendly Attention with linear complexity and discards the multi-head mechanism. Besides, we find that cross-resolution attention is more efficient to gather global context information for high-resolution branch by spreading the high level knowledge learned from low-resolution branch. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RTFormer, it achieves state-of-the-art on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCOStuff, and shows promising results on ADE20K.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanism linear complexity*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on efficient attention mechanisms having linear complexity, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Linear Attention Variants\n\n### SAMSA: SAMpling-Self-Attention\nThe SAMSA mechanism proposes a context-aware linear complexity self-attention method. It uses a differentiable sampling without replacement to attend to the most important token set, defined by the data. This approach reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, making it efficient for multiple data modalities. SAMSA achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks while being faster in inference.\n\n### Linear-Complexity Multiplication (-Mul or L-Mul)\nThe -Mul or L-Mul algorithm approximates floating point multiplication with integer addition operations, reducing the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. This method replaces the complicated tensor multiplications in attention mechanisms with integer additions, significantly lowering the computation resource usage. It has been shown to maintain high precision and performance across various tasks, including natural language understanding and visual question answering.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Designs\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nImplementing sparse attention can reduce both memory and computational requirements by focusing only on the most relevant tokens.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/51 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\n(2020), but the elementwise operations in the recurrent update cannot make use of tensor cores and result in low arithmetic intensity. Hence, while the recurrent form generally has the lowest total FLOPs among the three forms, this does not translate to actual wall-time efficiency. And while it is theoretically possible to parallelize linear recurrences via the parallel scan algorithm, this method requires materializing the 2D hidden state for each time step. This incurs a significant memory I/O burden, thereby offsetting the benefits of parallelism over the sequence length and resulting in slow actual running speeds, as in Katsch (2023). Parallel form. The parallel form could be as efficient as FlashAttention using similar I/O optimization techniques, as demonstrated by Qin et al. (2023b). However, the high number of FLOPs (due to the quadratic complexity) makes the long-sequence training expensive, the same issue that the na\u00efve implementation of softmax attention would suffer from. Chunkwise form. The chunkwise parallel form, which interpolates between the parallel and recurrent forms with an extra \"parameter\" $C$, makes it possible to more easily make the above tradeoffs for fine-grained optimization. Unlike the recurrent form, most operations can be done via matmuls, enabling the use of tensor cores (if $C$ is set to a multiple of 16). Though the chunkwise training algorithm has been discussed before in the literature (Hua et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023a), most implementations are not I/O-aware and thus slower than FlaShATtENTION for moderate sequence lengths (e.g., 2K-4K). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=622&width=663&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=257)\n\nFigure 1: (a) FLASHLINEARATTENTION without materialization. This version is more memory-efficient. (b-c) FlASHLINEARATTENTION with materialization. This version enables sequence-level chunkwise parallelism. ### 3.3 FlashLinearAttention: Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention with the Chunkwise Form\n\nWe describe our I/O-aware, hardware-efficient implementation of the chunkwise form. We give two versions, whose forward and backward passes differ depending on whether the chunk-level hidden states $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ are materialized in HBM. See Alg. 1 and Fig. 1 for the forward pass. (Alg. 2 in the appendix describes the backward pass.) At a high level, we use tiling to load tensors block-by-block and re-use tensor blocks on chip to avoid multiple HBM I/O as much as possible. For example, when $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ is loaded to SRAM, both $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{S}$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{K}_{[n]}^{\\top} \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_{[n]}$ can be computed on chip, which avoids loading $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ twice, thus saving HBM I/O. The non-materialization version computes $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ sequentially for $n \\in[N]$, using SRAM to temporarily store $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$, which is memory-efficient. This version parallelizes across batch size, number of heads, and head dimensions, but lacks sequence-level parallelim. When the batch size is large, this level of parallelism is sufficient to enable high GPU occupancy. In long-sequence and large scale training settings where batch size is small, the SMs cannot be fully exploited in this case. The materialization version first performs the inter-chunk recurrence (Eq. 2) and stores all $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ for $n \\in[N]$ in HBM. Then, the $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ 's can be computed in parallel for all chunks. This approach offers better parallelism but increases the memory footprint by approximately 10-20\\%. We mitigate this through recomputation, where the hidden states discarded after the forward pass and recomputed during the backward pass. We find this introduces a small runtime overhead but significantly reduces the memory footprint, and we adopt this strategy by default. Figure 2 shows the speed and memory footprint of our implementation. Both versions of FLASHLINEARATTENTION are substantially faster than FlASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=475&width=811&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2: Speed comparison on a single H100 GPU with batch size 32 , number of heads 16 , head dimension 64 , and chunk size 64.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hardware optimization techniques attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Wipf*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work first outlines several major obstacles before providing companion techniques to at least partially address them, demonstrating for the first time a close association between energy function minimization and deep layers with self-attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models such as the Transformer are often constructed by heuristics and experience. To provide a complementary foundation, in this work we study the following problem: Is it possible to find an energy function underlying the Transformer model, such that descent steps along this energy correspond with the Transformer forward pass? By finding such a function, we can view Transformers as the unfolding of an interpretable optimization process across iterations. This unfolding perspective has been frequently adopted in the past to elucidate more straightforward deep models such as MLPs and CNNs; however, it has thus far remained elusive obtaining a similar equivalence for more complex models with self-attention mechanisms like the Transformer. To this end, we first outline several major obstacles before providing companion techniques to at least partially address them, demonstrating for the first time a close association between energy function minimization and deep layers with self-attention. This interpretation contributes to our intuition and understanding of Transformers, while potentially laying the ground-work for new model designs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

We show that this algorithm can be successfully applied to learn better quality compact policies than those using standard gradient estimation techniques. The compact policies we learn have several advantages over unstructured ones, including faster training algorithms and faster inference. These benefits are important when the policy is deployed on real hardware with limited resources. Further, compact policies provide more scalable architectures for derivative-free optimization (DFO) in high-dimensional spaces. We show that most robotics tasks from the OpenAI Gym can be solved using neural networks with less than 300 parameters, with almost linear time complexity of the inference phase, with up to 13x fewer parameters relative to the Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithm introduced by Salimans et al.

In particular, the use of multi-head attention extends single-head attention by allowing a model to jointly attend information from different perspectives. Without explicit constraining, however, multi-head attention may suffer from attention collapse, an issue that makes different heads extract similar attentive features, thus limiting the model's representation power. In this paper, for the first time, we provide a novel understanding of multi-head attention from a Bayesian perspective. Based on the recently developed particle-optimization sampling techniques, we propose a non-parametric approach that explicitly improves the repulsiveness in multi-head attention and consequently strengthens model's expressiveness. Remarkably, our Bayesian interpretation provides theoretical inspirations on the not-well-understood questions: why and how one uses multi-head attention. Extensive experiments on various attention models and applications demonstrate that the proposed repulsive attention can improve the learned feature diversity, leading to more informative representations with consistent performance improvement on various tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Inspired by recent studies that explore the presence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives disproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic importance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a more profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and to uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly optimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning. Specifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the attention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and tasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of sequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention sinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon our findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT) that automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during inference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT consistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different applications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to 7.30% in accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B.

ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques attention mechanisms*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Model-Architecture Co-Design for High Performance Temporal GNN Inference on FPGA\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques attention mechanisms*\n\n*Carl Busart, Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Bingyi Zhang, Hongkuan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) are powerful models to capture temporal, structural, and contextual information on temporal graphs. The generated temporal node embeddings outperform other methods in many downstream tasks. Real-world applications require high performance inference on real-time streaming dynamic graphs. However, these models usually rely on complex attention mechanisms to capture relationships between temporal neighbors. In addition, maintaining vertex memory suffers from intrinsic temporal data dependency that hinders task-level parallelism, making it inefficient on general-purpose processors. In this work, we present a novel model-architecture co-design for inference in memory-based TGNNs on FPGAs. The key modeling optimizations we propose include a light-weight method to compute attention scores and a related temporal neighbor pruning strategy to further reduce computation and memory accesses. These are holistically coupled with key hardware optimizations that leverage FPGA hardware. We replace the temporal sampler with an on-chip FIFO based hardware sampler and the time encoder with a look-up-table. We train our simplified models using knowledge distillation to ensure similar accuracy vis-\\'a-vis the original model. Taking advantage of the model optimizations, we propose a principled hardware architecture using batching, pipelining, and prefetching techniques to further improve the performance. We also propose a hardware mechanism to ensure the chronological vertex updating without sacrificing the computation parallelism. We evaluate the performance of the proposed hardware accelerator on three real-world datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. Accelerating Error Correction Code Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization techniques attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lior Wolf, Yoni Choukroun, Matan Levy*\n\n**Abstract:** Error correction codes (ECC) are crucial for ensuring reliable information transmission in communication systems. Choukroun & Wolf (2022b) recently introduced the Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT), which has demonstrated promising performance across various transmission channels and families of codes. However, its high computational and memory demands limit its practical applications compared to traditional decoding algorithms. Achieving effective quantization of the ECCT presents significant challenges due to its inherently small architecture, since existing, very low-precision quantization techniques often lead to performance degradation in compact neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel acceleration method for transformer-based decoders. We first propose a ternary weight quantization method specifically designed for the ECCT, inducing a decoder with multiplication-free linear layers. We present an optimized self-attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity via codeaware multi-heads processing. Finally, we provide positional encoding via the Tanner graph eigendecomposition, enabling a richer representation of the graph connectivity. The approach not only matches or surpasses ECCT's performance but also significantly reduces energy consumption, memory footprint, and computational complexity. Our method brings transformer-based error correction closer to practical implementation in resource-constrained environments, achieving a 90% compression ratio and reducing arithmetic operation energy consumption by at least 224 times on modern hardware.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hardware optimization techniques for attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization\n\n- **Block-based Processing**: Techniques like those described in Lightning Attention-2 and CHELA involve separating intra-block and inter-block attention calculations. This approach allows for more efficient memory hierarchy exploitation by handling different scales of attention differently. For instance, using conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention for inter-blocks can reduce memory pressure and improve cache utilization.\n\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Tiling is a crucial technique for optimizing memory hierarchy. It involves dividing the computation into smaller blocks that can be processed efficiently within the available memory and cache. This method is highlighted in the analysis of Lightning Attention-2, which leverages tiling to handle intra-block and inter-block components separately, thus optimizing memory usage.\n\n## Tiling Strategies\n\n- **Forward and Backward Passes**: Tiling techniques can be applied to both forward and backward passes in the computation. This is mentioned in the analysis note, where IO-aware implementations using Triton and block-based processing are suggested to optimize both passes efficiently[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Lightning Attention-2**: This method specifically utilizes tiling to achieve true linear complexity in attention calculations. By handling intra-block and inter-block components separately, it optimizes the computational process and reduces memory footprint.\n\n## Cache Utilization\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: By dividing the computation into blocks, models like Lightning Attention-2 and CHELA can better utilize cache memory. This approach reduces the memory pressure and improves cache utilization, leading to more efficient computation.\n\n- **SPARSEK Attention**: This method integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator to select a constant number of key-value pairs for each query. This selective sampling helps in maintaining a constant memory footprint and improves cache utilization during generation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Algorithm Design\n\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: The paper on efficient memristor accelerators for transformer self-attention introduces a hardware-aware design that leverages memristor-based in-memory computing. This design performs matrix operations in an analog manner, integrating computation into memory, which significantly improves efficiency and reduces latency.\n\n- **Optimized Hardware Deployment**: Deploying models on specialized hardware like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) can accelerate model inference. Techniques such as model pruning, quantization, and model distillation can also be optimized for these hardware platforms to enhance performance and efficiency.\n\n- **Control Variates and Adaptive Sampling**: Methods like those described in the Control Variates paper and adaptive sampling strategies can be designed with hardware efficiency in mind. These methods reduce the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity, which is crucial for hardware-aware algorithm design[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the key strategies involve:\n- Using block-based processing and tiling to optimize memory hierarchy and cache utilization.\n- Implementing hardware-aware designs such as memristor-based accelerators and optimized deployment on specialized hardware.\n- Employing techniques like SPARSEK Attention and control variates to maintain efficiency and reduce memory footprint.\n- Leveraging adaptive sampling mechanisms to further optimize computational efficiency.\n",

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1810.12698, 2018.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

Transformer-based model for symbolic regression via joint supervised learning\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Wenqiang Li, Weijun Li, Linjun Sun, Min Wu, Lina Yu, Jingyi Liu, Yanjie Li, Song Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** The core idea is that a joint learning mechanism combining supervised contrastive learning is proposed, which makes features of data points from expressions with the same skeleton more similar so as to effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Symbolic regression (SR) is an important technique for discovering hidden mathematical expressions from observed data. Transformer-based approaches have been widely used for machine translation due to their high performance, and are recently highly expected to be used for SR. They input the data points, then output the expression skeleton, and finally optimize the coefficients. However, recent transformer-based methods for SR focus more attention on large scale training data and ignore the ill-posed problem: the lack of sufficient supervision, i.e., expressions that may be completely different have the same supervision because of their same skeleton, which makes it challenging to deal with data that may be from the same expression skeleton but with different coefficients. Therefore, we present a transformer-based model for SR with the ability to alleviate this problem. Specifically, we leverage a feature extractor based on pure residual MLP networks to obtain more information about data points. Furthermore, the core idea is that we propose a joint learning mechanism combining supervised contrastive learning, which makes features of data points from expressions with the same skeleton more similar so as to effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem. The benchmark results show that the proposed method is up to 25% higher with respect to the recovery rate of skeletons than typical transformer-based methods. Moreover, our method outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods based on reinforcement learning and genetic programming in terms of the coefficient of determination (R).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Spoken Language Understanding for Task-oriented Dialogue Systems with Augmented Memory Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jie Wu, I. Harris, Hongzhi Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach to model long-term slot context and to fully utilize the semantic correlation between slots and intents is proposed, adopting a key-value memory network to model slot context dynamically and to track more important slot tags decoded before, which are then fed into the decoder for slot tagging.\n\n**Abstract:** Spoken language understanding, usually including intent detection and slot filling, is a core component to build a spoken dialog system. Recent research shows promising results by jointly learning of those two tasks based on the fact that slot filling and intent detection are sharing semantic knowledge. Furthermore, attention mechanism boosts joint learning to achieve state-of-the-art results. However, current joint learning models ignore the following important facts: 1. Long-term slot context is not traced effectively, which is crucial for future slot filling. 2. Slot tagging and intent detection could be mutually rewarding, but bi-directional interaction between slot filling and intent detection remains seldom explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model long-term slot context and to fully utilize the semantic correlation between slots and intents. We adopt a key-value memory network to model slot context dynamically and to track more important slot tags decoded before, which are then fed into our decoder for slot tagging. Furthermore, gated memory information is utilized to perform intent detection, mutually improving both tasks through global optimization. Experiments on benchmark ATIS and Snips datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms other methods, especially for the slot filling task.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. A Self-Attentive Model with Gate Mechanism for Spoken Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Changliang Li, Liang Li, Ji Qi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel self-attentive model with gate mechanism to fully utilize the semantic correlation between slot and intent and outperforms other popular methods by a large margin in terms of both intent detection error rate and slot filling F1-score is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Spoken Language Understanding (SLU), which typically involves intent determination and slot filling, is a core component of spoken dialogue systems. Joint learning has shown to be effective in SLU given that slot tags and intents are supposed to share knowledge with each other. However, most existing joint learning methods only consider joint learning by sharing parameters on surface level rather than semantic level. In this work, we propose a novel self-attentive model with gate mechanism to fully utilize the semantic correlation between slot and intent. Our model first obtains intent-augmented embeddings based on neural network with self-attention mechanism. And then the intent semantic representation is utilized as the gate for labelling slot tags. The objectives of both tasks are optimized simultaneously via joint learning in an end-to-end way. We conduct experiment on popular benchmark ATIS. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art and outperforms other popular methods by a large margin in terms of both intent detection error rate and slot filling F1-score. This paper gives a new perspective for research on SLU.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 125  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. Multichannel End-to-end Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tsubasa Ochiai, Shinji Watanabe, Takaaki Hori, J. Hershey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The end-to-end framework for speech recognition is extended to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network, allowing the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end- to-end speech recognition objective.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of speech recognition is in the midst of a paradigm shift: end-to-end neural networks are challenging the dominance of hidden Markov models as a core technology. Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 90  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on tensor core optimization for attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Matrix Multiplication Reformulation Techniques\n\n- The use of matrix multiplication-friendly reformulations is crucial for leveraging tensor cores. For instance, the Gated Linear Attention mechanism allows most operations to be performed via matrix multiplications, enabling the effective use of tensor cores.\n- FlashFFTConv demonstrates how matrix decomposition can be used to compute FFTs using matrix multiply units, which is applicable to attention mechanisms that involve complex computations.\n\n## Kernel Fusion Strategies\n\n- Kernel fusion is a technique that reduces memory bandwidth requirements by combining multiple operations into a single kernel. This is highlighted in the Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism work, where kernel fusion and intermediate state caching enhance practical efficiency by decreasing communication overhead.\n- Together AI's FlashAttention-3 also emphasizes the importance of kernel fusion and memory optimization, achieving up to 75% GPU utilization and reducing memory footprint, which is beneficial for large-scale deployments.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n- Optimizing for tensor core utilization is a key aspect. For example, the ND H200 v5-series virtual machines, powered by NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs, offer significant improvements in memory bandwidth and computation efficiency. This is particularly relevant when optimizing batch size and tensor parallelism to maximize GPU utilization.\n- FlashAttention-3 by Together AI is specifically designed to optimize attention mechanisms on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, achieving up to 75% GPU utilization and nearly doubling the performance compared to previous models.\n\n## Performance Analysis and Benchmarks\n\n- The performance analysis of the ND H200 v5-series virtual machines provides detailed metrics on throughput and latency, highlighting the impact of input sequence length, output sequence length, batch size, and tensor parallelism on inference performance. This analysis helps in optimizing the model for time efficiency or cost-effectiveness.\n- Together AI's benchmarks show that FlashAttention-3 operates at nearly 1.2 PFLOPS while maintaining competitive accuracy, offering up to 2x faster processing speed and significant reductions in operational costs.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Memory Optimization**: The use of key-value caches, as discussed in the optimization of language model inference on Azure, can help avoid recalculating attention values for every token in the sequence, reducing memory usage and improving efficiency.\n- **Adaptive Computation Scheduling**: Techniques like the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM) dynamically adjust attention based on input characteristics, which can be beneficial for handling diverse and dynamic data environments. This adaptability ensures that the model can balance between broad and focused attention distributions as needed.\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014matrix multiplication reformulation, kernel fusion, hardware-specific optimizations, and careful performance analysis\u2014the researchers can significantly enhance the efficiency and performance of their autoregressive language models, particularly in terms of tensor core utilization and overall hardware efficiency.\n",

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, and parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 678  (*Influential: 70*)\n\n#### 2. Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/epfml/landmark-attention/.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 3. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. BayesPCN: A Continually Learnable Predictive Coding Associative Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jason Yoo, F. Wood*\n\n**TL;DR:** BayesPCN is presented, a hierarchical associative memory capable of performing continual one-shot memory writes without meta-learning and able to gradually forget past observations to free its memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Associative memory plays an important role in human intelligence and its mechanisms have been linked to attention in machine learning. While the machine learning community's interest in associative memories has recently been rekindled, most work has focused on memory recall ($read$) over memory learning ($write$). In this paper, we present BayesPCN, a hierarchical associative memory capable of performing continual one-shot memory writes without meta-learning. Moreover, BayesPCN is able to gradually forget past observations ($forget$) to free its memory. Experiments show that BayesPCN can recall corrupted i.i.d. high-dimensional data observed hundreds to a thousand ``timesteps'' ago without a large drop in recall ability compared to the state-of-the-art offline-learned parametric memory models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Ontological attention ensembles for capturing semantic concepts in ICD code prediction from clinical text\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mat\u00fas Falis, Maciej Pajak, Aneta Lisowska, Patrick Schrempf, Lucas Deckers, Shadia S. Mikhael, S. Tsaftaris, Alison Q. O'Neil*\n\n**TL;DR:** An ontological attention mechanism which matches the structure of the ICD ontology, in which shared attention vectors are learned at each level of the hierarchy, and combined into label-dependent ensembles, is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a semantically interpretable system for automated ICD coding of clinical text documents. Our contribution is an ontological attention mechanism which matches the structure of the ICD ontology, in which shared attention vectors are learned at each level of the hierarchy, and combined into label-dependent ensembles. Analysis of the attention heads shows that shared concepts are learned by the lowest common denominator node. This allows child nodes to focus on the differentiating concepts, leading to efficient learning and memory usage. Visualisation of the multi-level attention on the original text allows explanation of the code predictions according to the semantics of the ICD ontology. On the MIMIC-III dataset we achieve a 2.7% absolute (11% relative) improvement from 0.218 to 0.245 macro-F1 score compared to the previous state of the art across 3,912 codes. Finally, we analyse the labelling inconsistencies arising from different coding practices which limit performance on this task.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory hierarchy optimization for attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Cache Utilization Strategies\n\n- **DuoAttention** introduces a method of categorizing attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming Heads, which helps in optimizing cache utilization. Retrieval Heads use a full Key-Value (KV) cache to maintain long-term context, while Streaming Heads use a reduced, constant-length cache for recent tokens, minimizing unnecessary memory usage.\n\n## Memory Access Patterns\n\n- **SeerAttention** optimizes memory access by learning the intrinsic sparsity in attention maps. This mechanism adaptively identifies important blocks in the attention map, reducing the need to compute and store full attention maps, which improves memory efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Block-Based Processing\n\n- **Block-based processing with tiling optimizations** is highlighted in the analysis of FastTTTLinear. This approach involves dividing the data into blocks and processing them in a way that optimizes cache efficiency and reduces memory bandwidth requirements. This strategy is crucial for improving the performance of attention mechanisms.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Memory Management\n\n- The use of **memristor-based in-memory computing** for transformer networks is discussed in one of the sources. This approach integrates computation into memory, using memristor crossbar arrays to perform matrix operations efficiently. This method reduces power consumption and latency by avoiding the need to move data between memory and processing units.\n\n### Specific Techniques and Strategies\n\n- **Kernel Fusion**: Techniques like kernel fusion, as mentioned in the analysis, can reduce memory bandwidth requirements by combining multiple operations into a single kernel. This is particularly effective in long-sequence processing and can be applied to attention mechanisms to improve efficiency.\n\n- **Intermediate State Caching**: The analysis notes the importance of intermediate state caching in enhancing efficiency. By caching intermediate results, models can avoid redundant computations and reduce memory pressure, which is beneficial for attention mechanisms that involve complex matrix operations.\n\n- **Strategic Data Movement**: Optimizing data movement within the memory hierarchy is crucial. Strategies such as minimizing HBM (High-Bandwidth Memory) access and using block-based processing can significantly improve performance by reducing the overhead of data movement.\n\n### Implementation and Optimization\n\n- **Cache-Aware Algorithm Design**: Designing algorithms that are aware of the cache hierarchy can significantly improve performance. This involves ensuring that data is accessed in a pattern that maximizes cache hits and minimizes cache misses.\n\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Optimizations tailored to specific hardware architectures, such as GPU architectures, can further enhance the efficiency of attention mechanisms. This includes using libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow that support dynamic computation graphs and efficient GPU utilization.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models, particularly in terms of memory hierarchy optimization for attention mechanisms.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

However, it has difficulty in handling long documents due to the quadratic complexity with input text length. In order to handle this problem, we propose a hierarchical interactive Transformer (Hi-Transformer) for efficient and effective long document modeling. Hi-Transformer models documents in a hierarchical way, i.e., first learns sentence representations and then learns document representations. It can effectively reduce the complexity and meanwhile capture global document context in the modeling of each sentence. More specifically, we first use a sentence Transformer to learn the representations of each sentence. Then we use a document Transformer to model the global document context from these sentence representations. Next, we use another sentence Transformer to enhance sentence modeling using the global document context. Finally, we use hierarchical pooling method to obtain document embedding. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the efficiency and effectiveness of Hi-Transformer in long document modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/13 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nYi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, and Donald Metzler. 2020.

InstOptima: Evolutionary Multi-objective Instruction Optimization via Large Language Model-based Instruction Operators\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Heng Yang, Ke Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel approach that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an objective-guided mechanism for instruction operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** Instruction-based language modeling has received significant attention in pretrained language models. However, the efficiency of instruction engineering remains low and hinders the development of instruction studies. Recent studies have focused on automating instruction generation, but they primarily aim to improve performance without considering other crucial objectives that impact instruction quality, such as instruction length and perplexity. Therefore, we propose a novel approach (i.e., InstOptima) that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem. In contrast to text edition-based methods, our approach utilizes a large language model (LLM) to simulate instruction operators, including mutation and crossover. Furthermore, we introduce an objective-guided mechanism for these operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions. Experimental results demonstrate improved fine-tuning performance and the generation of a diverse set of high-quality instructions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Haoyi Wu, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method is proposed that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput, and is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Huge memory consumption has been a major bottleneck for deploying high-throughput large language models in real-world applications. In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

Primal-Attention: Self-attention through Asymmetric Kernel SVD in Primal Representation\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F.

Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization, and demonstrates that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-ATTention.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a new line of works has emerged to understand and improve self-attention in Transformers by treating it as a kernel machine. However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. InfoNet: Neural Estimation of Mutual Information without Test-Time Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Zhengyang Hu, Song Kang, Qunsong Zeng, Kaibin Huang, Yanchao Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures and evaluates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed mutual information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Estimating mutual correlations between random variables or data streams is essential for intelligent behavior and decision-making. As a fundamental quantity for measuring statistical relationships, mutual information has been extensively studied and utilized for its generality and equitability. However, existing methods often lack the efficiency needed for real-time applications, such as test-time optimization of a neural network, or the differentiability required for end-to-end learning, like histograms. We introduce a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures. By maximizing a dual formulation of mutual information through large-scale simulated training, our approach circumvents time-consuming test-time optimization and offers generalization ability. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed mutual information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications. Our results demonstrate that InfoNet and its training process provide a graceful efficiency-accuracy trade-off and order-preserving properties. We will make the code and models available as a comprehensive toolbox to facilitate studies in different fields requiring real-time mutual information estimation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Bifurcated Attention for Single-Context Large-Batch Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Ben Athiwaratkun, Sujan Kumar Gonugondla, Sanjay Krishna Gouda, Haifeng Qian, Hantian Ding, Qing Sun, Jun Wang, Jiacheng Guo, Liangfu Chen, Parminder Bhatia, Ramesh Nallapati, Sudipta Sengupta, Bing Xiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Bifurcated attention achieves this by dividing the attention mechanism during incremental decoding into two distinct GEMM operations, focusing on the KV cache from prefill and the decoding process, leading to lower latency and improving suitability for real-time applications.\n\n**Abstract:** In our study, we present bifurcated attention , a method developed for language model inference in single-context batch sampling contexts. This approach aims to reduce redundant memory IO costs, a significant factor in latency for high batch sizes and long context lengths. Bifurcated attention achieves this by dividing the attention mechanism during incremental decoding into two distinct GEMM operations, focusing on the KV cache from prefill and the decoding process. This method ensures precise computation and maintains the usual computational load (FLOPs) of standard attention mechanisms, but with reduced memory IO. Bifurcated attention is also compatible with multi-query attention mechanism known for reduced memory IO for KV cache, further enabling higher batch size and context length. The resulting efficiency leads to lower latency, improving suitability for real-time applications, e.g., enabling massively-parallel answer generation without substantially increasing latency, enhancing performance when integrated with post-processing techniques such as reranking.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. vTensor: Flexible Virtual Tensor Management for Efficient LLM Serving\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Jingwen Leng, Minyi Guo, Ke Zhang, Junping Zhao, Yuhong Guo, Changxu Shao, Shixuan Sun, Yu Feng, Feiyang Wu, Zihan Liu, Weiming Hu, Cong Guo, Rui Zhang, Jiale Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various domains, processing millions of daily requests. This surge in demand poses significant challenges in optimizing throughput and latency while keeping costs manageable. The Key-Value (KV) cache, a standard method for retaining previous computations, makes LLM inference highly bounded by memory. While batching strategies can enhance performance, they frequently lead to significant memory fragmentation. Even though cutting-edge systems like vLLM mitigate KV cache fragmentation using paged Attention mechanisms, they still suffer from inefficient memory and computational operations due to the tightly coupled page management and computation kernels. This study introduces the vTensor, an innovative tensor structure for LLM inference based on GPU virtual memory management (VMM). vTensor addresses existing limitations by decoupling computation from memory defragmentation and offering dynamic extensibility. Our framework employs a CPU-GPU heterogeneous approach, ensuring efficient, fragmentation-free memory management while accommodating various computation kernels across different LLM architectures. Experimental results indicate that vTensor achieves an average speedup of 1.86x across different models, with up to 2.42x in multi-turn chat scenarios. Additionally, vTensor provides average speedups of 2.12x and 3.15x in kernel evaluation, reaching up to 3.92x and 3.27x compared to SGLang Triton prefix-prefilling kernels and vLLM paged Attention kernel, respectively. Furthermore, it frees approximately 71.25% (57GB) of memory on the NVIDIA A100 GPU compared to vLLM, enabling more memory-intensive workloads.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-22\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Yu Qiao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

EdgeQAT: Entropy and Distribution Guided Quantization-Aware Training for the Acceleration of Lightweight LLMs on the Edge\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism optimization cache efficiency*\n\n*Yanzhi Wang, Pu Zhao, Miriam Leeser, Wei Niu, Zhihao Shu, Xuehang Guo, Chih-hsiang Li, Cheng Lyu, Peiyan Dong, Lei Lu, Zhaoyang Han, Changdi Yang, Zhenglun Kong, Xuan Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the remarkable strides of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various fields, the wide applications of LLMs on edge devices are limited due to their massive parameters and computations. To address this, quantization is commonly adopted to generate lightweight LLMs with efficient computations and fast inference. However, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods dramatically degrade in quality when quantizing weights, activations, and KV cache together to below 8 bits. Besides, many Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) works quantize model weights, leaving the activations untouched, which do not fully exploit the potential of quantization for inference acceleration on the edge. In this paper, we propose EdgeQAT, the Entropy and Distribution Guided QAT for the optimization of lightweight LLMs to achieve inference acceleration on Edge devices. We first identify that the performance drop of quantization primarily stems from the information distortion in quantized attention maps, demonstrated by the different distributions in quantized query and key of the self-attention mechanism. Then, the entropy and distribution guided QAT is proposed to mitigate the information distortion. Moreover, we design a token importance-aware adaptive method to dynamically quantize the tokens with different bit widths for further optimization and acceleration. Our extensive experiments verify the substantial improvements with our framework across various datasets. Furthermore, we achieve an on-device speedup of up to 2.37x compared with its FP16 counterparts across multiple edge devices, signaling a groundbreaking advancement.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on attention mechanism optimizations, cache efficiency, memory hierarchy management, block processing strategies, and hardware-specific optimizations, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Attention Mechanism Optimizations\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nImplementing sparse attention can significantly reduce computational and memory requirements. Techniques like sparse attention focus only on the most relevant tokens, decreasing both memory and computational needs.\n\n### FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is a fast and memory-efficient algorithm that computes exact attention in neural networks. It uses tiling and recomputation techniques to achieve a 2-4x speedup over standard attention mechanisms. This approach minimizes memory usage by processing smaller blocks of matrices, which is crucial for modern GPUs.\n\n### Block-Attention\nBlock-Attention divides the input sequence into discrete blocks, each independently calculating key-value (KV) states except for the final block. This method reduces inference latency and computational overhead, especially in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios. It achieves performance comparable to or even superior to traditional self-attention models while significantly enhancing efficiency.\n\n## Cache-Efficient Transformer Architectures\n\n### Efficient Architectures\nExploring alternative architectures like Linformer or Performer can reduce the complexity of self-attention. These models are designed to be more efficient in terms of computational complexity and memory usage.\n\n### SwiftFormer\nSwiftFormer introduces an efficient additive attention mechanism that replaces traditional quadratic matrix multiplication operations with linear element-wise multiplications. This approach enhances computational efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. SwiftFormer also uses a Shared Attention mechanism to reduce computational and memory overhead by sharing pre-computed attention weights across multiple layers.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Management in Transformers\n\n### Memory Compression Techniques\nTechniques such as quantization and pruning can help reduce the memory footprint of the model without significantly impacting performance. These methods are essential for managing the memory hierarchy efficiently.\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can integrate computation into memory, reducing latency and power consumption. This approach performs matrix operations in an analog manner, which can significantly improve efficiency in transformer self-attention calculations.\n\n## Block Processing Strategies for Attention\n\n### Block-Attention Mechanism\nAs mentioned earlier, the Block-Attention mechanism divides the input sequence into blocks and calculates KV states independently for each block. This approach allows for the reuse of KV states of previously seen passages, reducing latency and computational overhead.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Attention Optimizations\n\n### FlashAttention-2\nFlashAttention-2 enhances the original FlashAttention by parallelizing the workload across the sequence length dimension and optimizing memory access. This results in more efficient processing and reduced memory accesses, which are often bottlenecks in attention operations.\n\n### Memristor Crossbar Array\nThe use of a memristor crossbar array for matrix operations in self-attention can significantly improve efficiency. This method performs operations in an analog manner, reducing power consumption and latency. It involves mapping matrices to conductance values and using bipolar programming to handle negative values.\n\n### Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nDAAM integrates multi-head attention with Gaussian mixtures and skip connections, allowing for dynamic adjustment of attention focus. This mechanism is particularly effective for handling non-stationary data and can be optimized for computational efficiency, making it compatible with dot-product attention mechanisms.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details and Performance Benchmarks\n\n- **FlashAttention**: Achieves a 2-4x speedup over standard attention mechanisms and is integrated into popular libraries like PyTorch 2.0 and Hugging Face Transformers.\n- **SwiftFormer**: Achieves 78.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset with a latency of only 0.8 ms on an iPhone 14, demonstrating its efficiency and performance.\n- **Block-Attention**: Reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) and FLOPs to 1.3% and 0.2% of self-attention models for long input sequences, maintaining comparable or superior accuracy.\n- **Memristor-Based Acceleration**: Demonstrates significantly improved efficiency with a power consumption of \\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\) and a latency of \\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\).\n\n## Memory Efficiency Metrics\n\n- **Memory Compression**: Techniques like quantization and pruning reduce the memory footprint without impacting performance significantly.\n- **FlashAttention**: Minimizes memory usage by processing smaller blocks of matrices, reducing memory transfers and computation times.\n- **Memristor-Based Acceleration**: Integrates computation into memory, reducing the need for intermediate results and data dependencies, thus optimizing memory usage.\n\n## Hardware Utilization Strategies\n\n- **Tensor Core Utilization**: Techniques like matrix decomposition and kernel fusion can efficiently utilize tensor cores, reducing I/O overhead and improving performance[Analysis Note].\n- **Context-Level Load Balancing**: Strategies like KV-Runahead can handle uneven KV-cache generation, offering speedups for large language models[Analysis Note].\n- **Memristor Crossbar Array**: Utilizes analog operations to perform matrix multiplications, optimizing power consumption and latency.\n\nThese strategies and techniques provide a comprehensive approach to optimizing attention mechanisms, managing memory hierarchies, and leveraging hardware-specific optimizations to improve the performance and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n",

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Xiang Meng, Shibal Ibrahim, Kayhan Behdin, Hussein Hazimeh, Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning, and proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\\times$ -- $8\\times$ faster. Notably, our work considers models with tens of billions of parameters, which is up to $100\\times$ larger than what has been previously considered in the structured pruning literature.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

FlexGen: High-Throughput Generative Inference of Large Language Models with a Single GPU\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Ce Zhang, Ion Stoica, Christopher R\u00e9, Percy Liang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention cache optimization*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Yu Qiao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster. The code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/LASP.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware efficiency, cache optimization, and memory hierarchy utilization, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources:\n\n## Hardware-Aware Attention Mechanisms and Optimizations\n\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing latency and power consumption. It utilizes memristor crossbar arrays for matrix operations, which can be particularly efficient for self-attention mechanisms in transformers.\n\n## Cache-Efficient Transformer Implementations\n\n- The work on \"POD-Attention\" for large language models (LLMs) highlights the importance of optimizing attention computation for hybrid batches. POD-Attention is a GPU kernel that computes prefill and decode attention concurrently, maximizing both compute and memory bandwidth utilization. This approach reduces periods of high demand followed by low utilization of resources, leading to improved performance and reduced latency.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization in Deep Learning\n\n- The \"Tiny-Transfer-Learning (TinyTL)\" method focuses on memory-efficient on-device learning by freezing weights and learning only the bias modules. This approach significantly reduces memory usage without sacrificing accuracy, which is crucial for optimizing the memory hierarchy in deep learning models. Additionally, the use of lite residual modules helps in refining feature extractors with minimal memory overhead.\n\n## Block-Based Processing for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The \"Head Partitioning Self Attention (HPSA)\" mechanism introduced in the context of Error Correction Code Transformers (ECCT) involves dividing attention heads into two groups: first-ring and second-ring message passing. This division enhances efficiency by structuring the attention mechanism to focus on nearest neighbors and second-ring connections, reducing computational complexity while maintaining performance.\n\n## Tensor Core Optimization Strategies\n\n- While the sources do not explicitly discuss tensor core optimization strategies in detail, the concept of utilizing GPU resources efficiently, as seen in POD-Attention, implies that optimizing tensor operations would involve similar strategies. This includes ensuring that both compute and memory bandwidth are utilized simultaneously to avoid underutilization of resources. The integration of such strategies with block-based processing and cache-aware attention computation would be crucial for optimizing tensor core operations.\n\n## Practical Hardware Optimizations and Memory Efficiency Improvements\n\n- The memristor-based accelerator demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency with low power consumption (\\(5.955 \\times 10^{-5} W\\)) and reduced latency (\\(1552 \\times 10^{7} ns\\)). This hardware optimization is practical and shows how integrating computation into memory can enhance overall efficiency.\n\n- The POD-Attention kernel improves performance by up to 28% and increases LLM serving throughput, highlighting the importance of concurrent computation of prefill and decode attention to utilize both compute and memory resources efficiently.\n\n## Cache Utilization Strategies\n\n- The POD-Attention approach addresses the issue of underutilized GPU resources by fusing the computation of prefill and decode attention in a CTA-parallel manner. This ensures better utilization of both compute and memory bandwidth, reducing critical latency metrics such as time-to-first-token (TTFT) and time-between-tokens (TBT).\n\n## Block Processing Techniques\n\n- The HPSA mechanism involves block-based processing by dividing the attention heads into specific groups, each focusing on different levels of connections in the Tanner graph. This structured approach enhances sparsity and reduces computational complexity, making it more efficient for resource-constrained environments.\n\n### Summary of Key Findings\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Memristor-based accelerators and POD-Attention kernels offer practical hardware optimizations that improve efficiency and reduce latency.\n- **Cache Efficiency**: POD-Attention and HPSA mechanisms demonstrate cache-efficient strategies by optimizing the utilization of compute and memory resources.\n- **Memory Hierarchy Optimization**: TinyTL and HPSA show how to optimize memory hierarchy by reducing memory usage and enhancing sparsity.\n- **Block Processing**: HPSA and POD-Attention illustrate the benefits of block-based processing in attention mechanisms.\n- **Tensor Core Optimization**: Efficient utilization of GPU resources, as seen in POD-Attention, can be applied to optimize tensor core operations.\n\nThese findings and strategies can help researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models by focusing on hardware-aware optimizations, cache efficiency, memory hierarchy utilization, block-based processing, and tensor core optimization.\n",

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Its first level uses a smaller sliding window pattern to aggregate information from neighbors. Its second level employs a larger window to increase receptive fields with pooling attention to reduce both computational cost and memory consumption. We first evaluate Poolingformer on two long sequence QA tasks: the monolingual NQ and the multilingual TyDi QA. Experimental results show that Poolingformer sits atop three official leaderboards measured by F1, outperforming previous state-of-the-art models by 1.9 points (79.8 vs. 77.9) on NQ long answer, 1.9 points (79.5 vs. 77.6) on TyDi QA passage answer, and 1.6 points (67.6 vs. 66.0) on TyDi QA minimal answer.

ChunkAttention: Efficient Self-Attention with Prefix-Aware KV Cache and Two-Phase Partition\n\n*From Search Query: block based attention cache optimization techniques*\n\n*Lu Ye, Ze Tao, Yong Huang, Yang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ChunkAttention is introduced, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is an essential component of large language models (LLM) but a significant source of inference latency for long sequences. In multi-tenant LLM serving scenarios, the compute and memory operation cost of self-attention can be optimized by using the probability that multiple LLM requests have shared system prompts in prefixes. In this paper, we introduce ChunkAttention, a prefix-aware self-attention module that can detect matching prompt prefixes across multiple requests and share their key/value tensors in memory at runtime to improve the memory utilization of KV cache. This is achieved by breaking monolithic key/value tensors into smaller chunks and structuring them into the auxiliary prefix tree. Consequently, on top of the prefix-tree based KV cache, we design an efficient self-attention kernel, where a two-phase partition algorithm is implemented to improve the data locality during self-attention computation in the presence of shared system prompts. Experiments show that ChunkAttention can speed up the self-attention kernel by 3.2-4.8$\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art implementation, with the length of the system prompt ranging from 1024 to 4096.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. One-Line-of-Code Data Mollification Improves Optimization of Likelihood-based Generative Models\n\n*From Search Query: block based attention cache optimization techniques*\n\n*Ba-Hien Tran, Giulio Franzese, Pietro Michiardi, M. Filippone*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper connects data mollification through the addition of Gaussian noise to Gaussian homotopy, which is a well-known technique to improve optimization, and demonstrates that this provides a boost in generation quality of likelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Models (GMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their tremendous success in various domains, such as computer vision where they are capable to generate impressive realistic-looking images. Likelihood-based GMs are attractive due to the possibility to generate new data by a single model evaluation. However, they typically achieve lower sample quality compared to state-of-the-art score-based diffusion models (DMs). This paper provides a significant step in the direction of addressing this limitation. The idea is to borrow one of the strengths of score-based DMs, which is the ability to perform accurate density estimation in low-density regions and to address manifold overfitting by means of data mollification. We connect data mollification through the addition of Gaussian noise to Gaussian homotopy, which is a well-known technique to improve optimization. Data mollification can be implemented by adding one line of code in the optimization loop, and we demonstrate that this provides a boost in generation quality of likelihood-based GMs, without computational overheads. We report results on image data sets with popular likelihood-based GMs, including variants of variational autoencoders and normalizing flows, showing large improvements in FID score.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we present novel theoretical results on the complexity of derivative-free policy optimization on an important class of robust control tasks, namely the structured H \u221e synthesis with static output feedback. Optimal H \u221e synthesis under structural constraints leads to a constrained nonconvex nonsmooth problem and is typically addressed using subgradient-based policy search techniques that are built upon the concept of Goldstein subdifferential or other notions of enlarged subdifferential. In this paper, we study the complexity of finding ( \u03b4, \u03f5 ) -stationary points for such nonsmooth robust control design tasks using policy optimization methods which can only access the zeroth-order oracle (i.e. the H \u221e norm of the closed-loop system). First, we study the exact oracle setting and identify the coerciveness of the cost function to prove high-probability feasibility/complexity bounds for derivative-free policy optimization on this problem. Next, we derive a sample complexity result for the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) H \u221e -norm estimation. We combine this with our analysis to obtain the first sample complexity of model-free, trajectory-based, zeroth-order policy optimization on finding ( \u03b4, \u03f5 ) -stationary points for structured H \u221e control. Numerical results are also provided to demonstrate our theory.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Learning Linear Block Error Correction Codes\n\n*From Search Query: block based attention cache optimization techniques*\n\n*Yoni Choukroun, Lior Wolf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that the proposed decoder outperforms existing neural decoding on conventional codes, the suggested framework generates codes that outperform the {analogous} conventional codes, and the codes developed not only excel with the decoder but also show enhanced performance with traditional decoding techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Error correction codes are a crucial part of the physical communication layer, ensuring the reliable transfer of data over noisy channels. The design of optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern, especially for short block lengths. While neural decoders have recently demonstrated their advantage over classical decoding techniques, the neural design of the codes remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a unified encoder-decoder training of binary linear block codes. To this end, we adapt the coding setting to support efficient and differentiable training of the code for end-to-end optimization over the order two Galois field. We also propose a novel Transformer model in which the self-attention masking is performed in a differentiable fashion for the efficient backpropagation of the code gradient. Our results show that (i) the proposed decoder outperforms existing neural decoding on conventional codes, (ii) the suggested framework generates codes that outperform the {analogous} conventional codes, and (iii) the codes we developed not only excel with our decoder but also show enhanced performance with traditional decoding techniques.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

We demonstrate our framework with NeuPSL, a state-of-the-art NeSy architecture. To achieve this, we propose a smooth primal and dual formulation of NeuPSL inference and show learning gradients are functions of the optimal dual variables. Additionally, we develop a dual block coordinate descent algorithm for the new formulation that naturally exploits warm-starts. This leads to over 100x learning runtime improvements over the current best NeuPSL inference method. Finally, we provide extensive empirical evaluations across 8 datasets covering a range of tasks and demonstrate our learning framework achieves up to a 16% point prediction performance improvement over alternative learning methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on block-based attention mechanisms, cache-aware attention computation, memory hierarchy optimization, efficient parallel processing, and hardware-specific tensor operation optimizations, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Block-Based Attention Mechanisms and Implementations\n\n- **DuoAttention**: This framework introduces a block-based approach by distinguishing between \"Retrieval Heads\" and \"Streaming Heads\" in attention mechanisms. Retrieval Heads require full attention across all tokens, while Streaming Heads focus on recent tokens and do not need full attention. This approach reduces memory and latency significantly without compromising long-context abilities.\n\n- **SqueezeAttention**: Although not strictly block-based, SqueezeAttention dynamically allocates the KV cache budget based on the importance of each layer's attention computations. This layer-wise optimization can be seen as a form of block-level management, where each layer is treated as a block with its own optimal cache budget.\n\n## Cache-Aware Attention Computation Techniques\n\n- **DuoAttention**: This method optimizes the KV cache by applying a full KV cache only to Retrieval Heads and using a lightweight, constant-length KV cache for Streaming Heads. This reduces both decoding and pre-filling memory and latency without significant accuracy loss.\n\n- **KV-Compress**: This technique involves KV cache compression that eliminates under-utilized key-value pairs, creating additional space and boosting overall throughput. It is particularly beneficial for setups with limited video RAM and can be integrated with PagedAttention to enhance LLM throughput.\n\n- **SqueezeAttention**: By dynamically allocating the KV cache budget based on the layer-wise importance of attention computations, SqueezeAttention reduces the memory footprint of the KV cache while maintaining inference accuracy.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization in Transformers\n\n- **DuoAttention**: The method significantly reduces memory usage by up to 2.55x for MHA and 1.67x for GQA models, and it accelerates decoding and pre-filling processes. This optimization is crucial for managing the memory hierarchy in transformers.\n\n- **KV-Compress**: This technique optimizes cache usage by removing under-utilized key-value pairs, allowing more sequences to be included in the decoding batch and thus improving overall throughput. It is particularly useful for resource-constrained devices.\n\n- **SqueezeAttention**: By optimizing the KV cache budget layer-wise, SqueezeAttention achieves up to 50% reduction in memory usage while maintaining the same level of inference accuracy. This approach is beneficial for large-scale deployments and resource-constrained devices.\n\n## Efficient Parallel Processing Strategies for Attention\n\n- **FlexGen**: While not specifically focused on attention mechanisms, FlexGen is a high-throughput generation engine that can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints. It aggregates memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk, which can be applied to optimize parallel processing in attention computations[Analysis Note, c].\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers**: This work introduces a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. It is faster even on short sequence lengths, indicating potential for efficient parallel processing[Analysis Note, a].\n\n## Hardware-Specific Tensor Operation Optimizations\n\n- **KV-Compress**: This method is designed to work with PagedAttention and is particularly beneficial for setups with limited video RAM, such as consumer-grade GPUs. It optimizes cache usage to include more sequences in the decoding batch, thereby boosting throughput.\n\n- **FlexGen**: This engine is designed to run LLMs with limited GPU memory and can be configured to utilize resources from the GPU, CPU, and disk. This hybrid approach can be adapted to optimize tensor operations specific to the available hardware[Analysis Note, c].\n\n- **Eigen Attention**: This approach performs attention operations in a low-rank space, reducing the KV cache memory overhead. It is orthogonal to existing KV cache compression techniques and can be used synergistically with them, making it a hardware-efficient solution.\n\nIn summary, these approaches and techniques provide practical implementation details, performance benchmarks, and memory efficiency metrics that can help in improving the design of autoregressive language models, particularly in terms of block-based attention, cache-aware computations, memory hierarchy optimization, and hardware-specific optimizations.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Score: 0.87)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/28 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1911.05507, 2019.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Parallel Successive Convex Approximation for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization parallel processing*\n\n*Meisam Razaviyayn, Mingyi Hong, Z. Luo, J. Pang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an inexact parallel BCD approach where at each iteration, a subset of the variables is updated in parallel by minimizing convex approximations of the original objective function and investigates the convergence of this parallel B CD method for both randomized and cyclic variable selection rules.\n\n**Abstract:** Consider the problem of minimizing the sum of a smooth (possibly non-convex) and a convex (possibly nonsmooth) function involving a large number of variables. A popular approach to solve this problem is the block coordinate descent (BCD) method whereby at each iteration only one variable block is updated while the remaining variables are held fixed. With the recent advances in the developments of the multi-core parallel processing technology, it is desirable to parallelize the BCD method by allowing multiple blocks to be updated simultaneously at each iteration of the algorithm. In this work, we propose an inexact parallel BCD approach where at each iteration, a subset of the variables is updated in parallel by minimizing convex approximations of the original objective function. We investigate the convergence of this parallel BCD method for both randomized and cyclic variable selection rules. We analyze the asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence behavior of the algorithm for both convex and non-convex objective functions. The numerical experiments suggest that for a special case of Lasso minimization problem, the cyclic block selection rule can outperform the randomized rule.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 90  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Practical Bayesian Optimization of Machine Learning Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization parallel processing*\n\n*Jasper Snoek, H. Larochelle, Ryan P. Adams*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes new algorithms that take into account the variable cost of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation and shows that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms.\n\n**Abstract:** The use of machine learning algorithms frequently involves careful tuning of learning parameters and model hyperparameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a \"black art\" requiring expert experience, rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. There is therefore great appeal for automatic approaches that can optimize the performance of any given learning algorithm to the problem at hand. In this work, we consider this problem through the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). We show that certain choices for the nature of the GP, such as the type of kernel and the treatment of its hyperparameters, can play a crucial role in obtaining a good optimizer that can achieve expertlevel performance. We describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning algorithm experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization for many algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2012\n\n**Citations:** 7308  (*Influential: 541*)\n\n#### 4. KV-Runahead: Scalable Causal LLM Inference by Parallel Key-Value Cache Generation\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization parallel processing*\n\n*Minsik Cho, Mohammad Rastegari, Devang Naik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase of LLM inference, and proposes context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Model or LLM inference has two phases, the prompt (or prefill) phase to output the first token and the extension (or decoding) phase to the generate subsequent tokens. In this work, we propose an efficient parallelization scheme, KV-Runahead to accelerate the prompt phase. The key observation is that the extension phase generates tokens faster than the prompt phase because of key-value cache (KV-cache). Hence, KV-Runahead parallelizes the prompt phase by orchestrating multiple processes to populate the KV-cache and minimizes the time-to-first-token (TTFT). Dual-purposing the KV-cache scheme has two main benefits. First, since KV-cache is designed to leverage the causal attention map, we minimize computation and computation automatically. Second, since it already exists for the extension phase, KV-Runahead is easy to implement. We further propose context-level load-balancing to handle uneven KV-cache generation (due to the causal attention) and to optimize TTFT. Compared with an existing parallelization scheme such as tensor or sequential parallelization where keys and values are locally generated and exchanged via all-gather collectives, our experimental results demonstrate that KV-Runahead can offer over 1.4x and 1.6x speedups for Llama 7B and Falcon 7B respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

All of these can be solved by more general distribution strategies (model-parallelism). Unfortunately, efficient model-parallel algorithms tend to be complicated to discover, describe, and to implement, particularly on large clusters. We introduce Mesh-TensorFlow, a language for specifying a general class of distributed tensor computations. Where data-parallelism can be viewed as splitting tensors and operations along the \"batch\" dimension, in Mesh-TensorFlow, the user can specify any tensor-dimensions to be split across any dimensions of a multi-dimensional mesh of processors. A Mesh-TensorFlow graph compiles into a SPMD program consisting of parallel operations coupled with collective communication primitives such as Allreduce. We use Mesh-TensorFlow to implement an efficient data-parallel, model-parallel version of the Transformer sequence-to-sequence model. Using TPU meshes of up to 512 cores, we train Transformer models with up to 5 billion parameters, surpassing state of the art results on WMT'14 English-to-French translation task and the one-billion-word language modeling benchmark.

This state can be used to accelerate optimization compared to plain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be allocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models trained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use 8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit optimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and stability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise quantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently quantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster optimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and performance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes: (1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for both large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to reduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of input tokens in language models. As a result, our 8-bit optimizers maintain 32-bit performance with a small fraction of the memory footprint on a range of tasks, including 1.5B parameter language modeling, GLUE finetuning, ImageNet classification, WMT'14 machine translation, MoCo v2 contrastive ImageNet pretraining+finetuning, and RoBERTa pretraining, without changes to the original optimizer hyperparameters. We open-source our 8-bit optimizers as a drop-in replacement that only requires a two-line code change.\n\n**Conference:** 8-bit-optimizers-via-block-wise-quantization-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. Harnessing Deep Learning and HPC Kernels via High-Level Loop and Tensor Abstractions on CPU Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization parallel processing*\n\n*Alexander Heinecke, Alexander Breuer, Antonio Noack, Abhisek Kundu, Hans Pabst, Kirill Voronin, Dhiraj Kalamkar, Evangelos Georganas*\n\n**Abstract:** During the past decade, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms, programming systems and hardware have converged with the High Performance Computing (HPC) counterparts. Nevertheless, the programming methodology of DL and HPC systems is stagnant, relying on highly-optimized, yet platform-specific and inflexible vendor-optimized libraries. Such libraries provide close-to-peak performance on specific platforms, kernels and shapes thereof that vendors have dedicated optimizations efforts, while they underperform in the remaining use-cases, yielding non-portable codes with performance glass-jaws. This work introduces a framework to develop efficient, portable DL and HPC kernels for modern CPU architectures. We decompose the kernel development in two steps: 1) Expressing the computational core using Tensor Processing Primitives (TPPs): a compact, versatile set of 2D-tensor operators, 2) Expressing the logical loops around TPPs in a high-level, declarative fashion whereas the exact instantiation (ordering, tiling, parallelization) is determined via simple knobs. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using standalone kernels and end-to-end workloads that outperform state-of-the-art implementations on diverse CPU platforms.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Tensorized Ant Colony Optimization for GPU Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: tensor core optimization parallel processing*\n\n*Ran Cheng, Tao Jiang, Luming Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is renowned for its effectiveness in solving Traveling Salesman Problems, yet it faces computational challenges in CPU-based environments, particularly with large-scale instances. In response, we introduce a Tensorized Ant Colony Optimization (TensorACO) to utilize the advancements of GPU acceleration. As the core, TensorACO fully transforms ant system and ant path into tensor forms, a process we refer to as tensorization. For the tensorization of ant system, we propose a preprocessing method to reduce the computational overhead by calculating the probability transition matrix. In the tensorization of ant path, we propose an index mapping method to accelerate the update of pheromone matrix by replacing the mechanism of sequential path update with parallel matrix operations. Additionally, we introduce an Adaptive Independent Roulette (AdaIR) method to overcome the challenges of parallelizing ACO's selection mechanism on GPUs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of TensorACO achieving up to 1921$\\times$ speedup over standard ACO. Moreover, the AdaIR method further improves TensorACO's convergence speed by 80% and solution quality by 2%.

Utilizing tensor cores can significantly enhance the performance of matrix operations, such as those in attention mechanisms and other linear transformations within the model.\n- The use of mixed-precision training with tensor cores, as seen in NVIDIA's examples, can achieve faster training times while maintaining target accuracy. For instance, the BERT model optimized with mixed-precision arithmetic and tensor cores on V100 GPUs shows improved training efficiency.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Parallel Processing Strategies\n\n- Modern GPUs like the NVIDIA RTX 3090, with its 10,496 CUDA cores and 328 Tensor cores, significantly enhance parallel computing capabilities. This hardware is particularly suited for deep learning tasks due to its large VRAM, high memory bandwidth, and support for NVLink, which enables multi-GPU configurations and reduces time to solution for large-scale applications.\n- Utilizing NVLink technology, as in the NVIDIA Tesla P100, allows for linking multiple GPUs at higher bandwidths than PCIe, which is essential for parallel processing in large-scale deep learning tasks.\n\n## Memory Bandwidth Optimization Methods\n\n- Optimizing memory bandwidth is critical for deep learning tasks. GPUs with high memory bandwidth, such as the NVIDIA RTX 3090 with 936.2 GB/s, ensure rapid data transfer between memory and processing units, reducing latency and enhancing training efficiency.\n- Efficient memory access patterns, such as those achieved through prefix-aware self-attention modules (e.g., ChunkAttention), can improve data locality and reduce memory bandwidth usage. Breaking large tensors into smaller chunks and using two-phase partition algorithms can also optimize memory access.\n\n## Cache Hierarchy Utilization Techniques\n\n- Cache-aware algorithm design is essential for optimizing deep learning models. Techniques like block-based processing with adaptive chunk sizes and two-phase partitioning can improve data locality and reduce the need for frequent memory accesses, thus optimizing cache usage.\n- Designing models with cache hierarchy in mind, such as the outer-product-based state expansion mechanism in HGRN2, allows for hardware-efficient training by minimizing cache misses and optimizing data movement patterns.\n\n## Efficient Parallel Attention Implementations\n\n- Efficient self-attention mechanisms, such as those described in \"Self-attention Does Not Need O(n^2) Memory\" and \"ChunkAttention,\" can reduce the memory requirements from O(n^2) to O(\u221an) or even lower, making them more suitable for parallel processing on accelerators. These implementations often involve sharing key/value tensors in memory and using prefix-aware mechanisms to detect matching prompt prefixes.\n- The Nystr\u00f6mformer algorithm, which approximates self-attention using the Nystr\u00f6m method, is another example of efficient parallel attention implementation that reduces computational and memory costs while maintaining performance.\n\nBy leveraging these techniques, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models:\n\n- **Practical Tensor Core Implementations**: Utilize mixed-precision training and optimize models to maximize tensor core usage for faster matrix operations.\n- **Parallel Processing Optimizations**: Use high-end GPUs with multiple cores and NVLink technology to enhance parallel computing capabilities.\n- **Memory Bandwidth Utilization**: Optimize memory access patterns through chunking and prefix-aware mechanisms to reduce memory bandwidth usage.\n- **Cache Hierarchy Utilization**: Design cache-aware algorithms and use techniques like block-based processing to minimize cache misses.\n- **Efficient Parallel Attention**: Implement self-attention mechanisms that reduce memory requirements and optimize data locality, such as ChunkAttention and Nystr\u00f6mformer.\n",
