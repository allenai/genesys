It effectively outlines the motivation behind enhancing the Conv GAU by integrating dynamic and multi-scale convolutional techniques. The proposal provides a structured problem analysis, highlighting the limitations of the current Conv GAU and the proposed solutions. Additionally, the mathematical formulations and implementation guidelines offer a solid foundation for understanding and replicating the proposed modifications. However, some sections, such as the detailed description of the dynamic convolutional kernel generation and multi-scale aggregation methods, could benefit from further elaboration to enhance comprehensiveness.\n\n2. **Innovation:**\n   \n   The proposal introduces a novel integration of dynamic and multi-scale convolutions within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) for autoregressive language models. While dynamic and multi-scale convolutions have been explored in other neural architectures (e.g., **DSTAGNN**, **MICN**, **Sequencer**), their specific application within GAUs remains relatively unexplored. This unique combination has the potential to significantly enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of GAUs, enabling them to better capture both local and long-range dependencies in language data. Furthermore, the emphasis on hardware-optimized implementations aligns with current research trends aimed at improving computational efficiency, as demonstrated in works like **FlashFFTConv** and **CacheOptRMSNorm**.\n\n3. **Feasibility:**\n   \n   The design is theoretically sound and builds upon established convolutional techniques. The implementation guidelines provided are detailed, suggesting that the integration of dynamic and multi-scale convolutions into GAUs can be achieved with careful engineering. The references to existing hardware optimization strategies offer practical pathways to maintain computational efficiency. However, the increased complexity from dynamic kernel generation and multi-scale processing may pose challenges in terms of implementation and optimization. Ensuring numerical stability and efficient memory management will be crucial for successful deployment.\n\n4. **Scalability:**\n   \n   The proposal addresses scalability by incorporating multi-scale convolutions, which allow the model to handle varying granularities of information without a significant increase in computational overhead. The principles outlined in **What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?** regarding sub-linear parameter scaling and decaying kernel structures are particularly relevant for ensuring that the model can scale effectively with longer sequences and larger datasets. Additionally, leveraging hardware optimization techniques ensures that the enhanced GAUs can maintain or improve performance as the model size grows.\n\n5. **Accuracy and Robustness:**\n   \n   Integrating dynamic convolutions enables the GAU to adapt its processing based on input features, which can enhance the model's ability to capture complex linguistic patterns and dependencies, potentially leading to improved accuracy. Multi-scale convolutions allow the model to effectively aggregate information at different levels of detail, contributing to better contextual understanding and robustness. The combination of these techniques is expected to reduce perplexity and increase performance on downstream tasks. However, the impact of these enhancements on training stability and the potential for overfitting should be carefully monitored.\n\n6. **Efficiency:**\n   \n   The proposal emphasizes maintaining computational efficiency through hardware-optimized implementations, drawing inspiration from works like **FlashFFTConv** and **CacheOptRMSNorm**. By adopting tiling, cache-aware algorithms, and leveraging tensor cores, the enhanced GAUs can achieve efficient convolution operations even with the added complexity of dynamic and multi-scale processing. Nevertheless, the introduction of dynamic kernel generation and multi-scale layers may introduce additional computational overhead. Mitigating this through efficient implementation strategies and lightweight convolutional networks will be essential to ensure that efficiency gains are realized without compromising model performance.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Innovative Integration:** Combining dynamic and multi-scale convolutions within GAUs is a novel approach that has the potential to significantly enhance model expressiveness and adaptability.\n2. **Comprehensive Problem Analysis:** The proposal clearly identifies the limitations of the current Conv GAU and presents well-thought-out solutions.\n3. **Alignment with Research Trends:** The focus on hardware optimization and efficient convolutional implementations aligns with current advancements in the field.\n4. **Detailed Implementation Guidelines:** Providing mathematical formulations and pseudo-code aids in understanding the proposed modifications.\n5. **Potential for Improved Performance:** Enhanced ability to capture both local and long-range dependencies can lead to lower perplexity and higher accuracy in language modeling tasks.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. **Implementation Complexity:** Integrating dynamic and multi-scale convolutions may introduce significant complexity, requiring careful engineering and optimization.\n2. **Computational Overhead:** The added layers and dynamic kernel generation could increase computational demands, potentially offsetting efficiency gains.\n3. **Numerical Stability:** Dynamic parameterization and multi-scale processing may lead to numerical instabilities, necessitating robust normalization and activation strategies.\n4. **Empirical Validation:** The proposal lacks empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhancements, making it essential to conduct comprehensive experiments.\n5. **Memory Management:** Efficient handling of memory, especially with multi-scale convolutions, is crucial to prevent bottlenecks and ensure scalability.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Provide Empirical Results:** Conduct and include preliminary experiments to showcase the benefits of integrating dynamic and multi-scale convolutions within GAUs. Comparative analyses with existing models would strengthen the proposal.\n2. **Elaborate on Implementation Details:** Further detail on dynamic kernel generation mechanisms and multi-scale aggregation methods would enhance understanding and replication efforts.\n3. **Address Numerical Stability:** Incorporate robust normalization techniques and stable activation functions to mitigate potential numerical instabilities.\n4. **Optimize Computational Efficiency:** Explore lightweight convolutional networks and efficient aggregation mechanisms to balance expressiveness with computational demands.\n5. **Detailed Hardware Optimization Strategies:** Provide more specific guidelines or references on implementing hardware optimizations, such as tiling and tensor core utilization, tailored to the proposed GAU enhancements.\n6. **Benchmarking and Comparative Studies:** Plan for extensive benchmarking against standard GAU implementations and other state-of-the-art models to validate performance improvements and scalability.\n\n---\n\n```rating 4.0```\n\n---",

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/67 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05946, 2015.

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/38 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\nY.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution*\n\n*Chao Li, Aojun Zhou, Anbang Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a single static convolutional kernel in each convolutional layer is the common training paradigm of modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Instead, recent research in dynamic convolution shows that learning a linear combination of $n$ convolutional kernels weighted with their input-dependent attentions can significantly improve the accuracy of light-weight CNNs, while maintaining efficient inference. However, we observe that existing works endow convolutional kernels with the dynamic property through one dimension (regarding the convolutional kernel number) of the kernel space, but the other three dimensions (regarding the spatial size, the input channel number and the output channel number for each convolutional kernel) are overlooked. Inspired by this, we present Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv), a more generalized yet elegant dynamic convolution design, to advance this line of research. ODConv leverages a novel multi-dimensional attention mechanism with a parallel strategy to learn complementary attentions for convolutional kernels along all four dimensions of the kernel space at any convolutional layer. As a drop-in replacement of regular convolutions, ODConv can be plugged into many CNN architectures. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets show that ODConv brings solid accuracy boosts for various prevailing CNN backbones including both light-weight and large ones, e.g., 3.77%~5.71%|1.86%~3.72% absolute top-1 improvements to MobivleNetV2|ResNet family on the ImageNet dataset. Intriguingly, thanks to its improved feature learning ability, ODConv with even one single kernel can compete with or outperform existing dynamic convolution counterparts with multiple kernels, substantially reducing extra parameters. Furthermore, ODConv is also superior to other attention modules for modulating the output features or the convolutional weights.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 150  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2.

Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. Why Are Convolutional Nets More Sample-Efficient than Fully-Connected Nets?\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional architectures*\n\n*Zhiyuan Li, Yi Zhang, Sanjeev Arora*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms, and demonstrates a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an $O(1)$ vs $Omega(d^2/\\varepsilon)$ gap.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks often dominate fully-connected counterparts in generalization performance, especially on image classification tasks. This is often explained in terms of 'better inductive bias'. However, this has not been made mathematically rigorous, and the hurdle is that the fully connected net can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training algorithm plays a role. The current work describes a natural task on which a provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms. We construct a single natural distribution on $\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\{\\pm 1\\}$ on which any orthogonal-invariant algorithm (i.e. fully-connected networks trained with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires $\\Omega(d^2)$ samples to generalize while $O(1)$ samples suffice for convolutional architectures. Furthermore, we demonstrate a single target function, learning which on all possible distributions leads to an $O(1)$ vs $\\Omega(d^2/\\varepsilon)$ gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on fully-connected network is orthogonal equivariant. Similar results are achieved for $\\ell_2$ regression and adaptive training algorithms, e.g. Adam and AdaGrad, which are only permutation equivariant.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

However, neural network architectures that perform well are still typically designed manually by experts in a cumbersome trial-and-error process. We propose a new method to automatically search for well-performing CNN architectures based on a simple hill climbing procedure whose operators apply network morphisms, followed by short optimization runs by cosine annealing. Surprisingly, this simple method yields competitive results, despite only requiring resources in the same order of magnitude as training a single network. E.g., on CIFAR-10, our method designs and trains networks with an error rate below 6% in only 12 hours on a single GPU; training for one day reduces this error further, to almost 5%.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 221  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 5. ConViT: improving vision transformers with soft convolutional inductive biases\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional architectures*\n\n*St\u00e9phane d'Ascoli, Hugo Touvron, Matthew L. Leavitt, Ari S. Morcos, G. Biroli, Levent Sagun*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPSA is introduced, a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a \u2018soft\u2019 convolutional inductive bias and outperforms the DeiT on ImageNet, while offering a much improved sample efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional architectures have proven to be extremely successful for vision tasks. Their hard inductive biases enable sample-efficient learning, but come at the cost of a potentially lower performance ceiling. Vision transformers rely on more flexible self-attention layers, and have recently outperformed CNNs for image classification. However, they require costly pre-training on large external datasets or distillation from pre-trained convolutional networks. In this paper, we ask the following question: is it possible to combine the strengths of these two architectures while avoiding their respective limitations? To this end, we introduce gated positional self-attention (GPSA), a form of positional self-attention which can be equipped with a \u2018soft\u2019 convolutional inductive bias. We initialize the GPSA layers to mimic the locality of convolutional layers, then give each attention head the freedom to escape locality by adjusting a gating parameter regulating the attention paid to position versus content information. The resulting convolutional-like ViT architecture, ConViT, outperforms the DeiT (Touvron et al 2020 arXiv:2012.12877) on ImageNet, while offering a much improved sample efficiency. We further investigate the role of locality in learning by first quantifying how it is encouraged in vanilla self-attention layers, then analyzing how it has escaped in GPSA layers. We conclude by presenting various ablations to better understand the success of the ConViT.

EvoPrompting: Language Models for Code-Level Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional language models*\n\n*Angelica Chen, David Dohan, David R. So*\n\n**TL;DR:** EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the recent impressive accomplishments of language models (LMs) for code generation, we explore the use of LMs as adaptive mutation and crossover operators for an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. While NAS still proves too difficult a task for LMs to succeed at solely through prompting, we find that the combination of evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt-tuning, a method we term EvoPrompting, consistently finds diverse and high performing models. We first demonstrate that EvoPrompting is effective on the computationally efficient MNIST-1D dataset, where EvoPrompting produces convolutional architecture variants that outperform both those designed by human experts and naive few-shot prompting in terms of accuracy and model size. We then apply our method to searching for graph neural networks on the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, where EvoPrompting is able to design novel architectures that outperform current state-of-the-art models on 21 out of 30 algorithmic reasoning tasks while maintaining similar model size. EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7.

However, many researchers wonder whether these models can maintain their dominance forever. Of course, we do not have answers now, but, as an attempt to find better neural architectures and training schemes, we pretrain a simple CNN using a GAN-style learning scheme and Wikipedia data, and then integrate it with standard TLMs. We show that on the GLUE tasks, the combination of our pretrained CNN with ALBERT outperforms the original ALBERT and achieves a similar performance to that of SOTA. Furthermore, on open-domain QA (Quasar-T and SearchQA), the combination of the CNN with ALBERT or RoBERTa achieved stronger performance than SOTA and the original TLMs. We hope that this work provides a hint for developing a novel strong network architecture along with its training scheme.

Geometry-Aware Supertagging with Heterogeneous Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution*\n\n*Konstantinos Kogkalidis, Michael Moortgat*\n\n**Abstract:** The syntactic categories of categorial grammar formalisms are structured\nunits made of smaller, indivisible primitives, bound together by the underlying\ngrammar's category formation rules. In the trending approach of constructive\nsupertagging, neural models are increasingly made aware of the internal\ncategory structure, which in turn enables them to more reliably predict rare\nand out-of-vocabulary categories, with significant implications for grammars\npreviously deemed too complex to find practical use. In this work, we revisit\nconstructive supertagging from a graph-theoretic perspective, and propose a\nframework based on heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutions aimed at exploiting\nthe distinctive structure of a supertagger's output space. We test our approach\non a number of categorial grammar datasets spanning different languages and\ngrammar formalisms, achieving substantial improvements over previous state of\nthe art scores.

Scaling Laws vs Model Architectures: How does Inductive Bias Influence\n  Scaling?\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution*\n\n*Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Samira Abnar, Hyung Won Chung, William Fedus, Jinfeng Rao, Sharan Narang, Vinh Q. Tran, Dani Yogatama, Donald Metzler*\n\n**Abstract:** There have been a lot of interest in the scaling properties of Transformer\nmodels. However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the\neffect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model\narchitectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does\ninductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream\n(pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study\nof scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers,\nSwitch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers,\nand recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1)\narchitecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling\nand (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales. We believe\nthat the findings outlined in this work has significant implications to how\nmodel architectures are currently evaluated in the community.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-21T15:50:22Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-21T15:50:22Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional language models*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large\nTransformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building\nblock of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in\nsequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing\nsubquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be\ncombined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in\ncapability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement\nfor attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long\nconvolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on\nsequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves\naccuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and\nother implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a\nnew state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language\nmodeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer\nquality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length\n2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence\nlength 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-21T18:29:25Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-19T20:08:39Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Zoology: Measuring and Improving Recall in Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: convolutional language models*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Aman Timalsina, Isys Johnson, Michael Poli, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-free language models that combine gating and convolutions are\ngrowing in popularity due to their efficiency and increasingly competitive\nperformance. To better understand these architectures, we pretrain a suite of\n17 attention and \"gated-convolution\" language models, finding that SoTA\ngated-convolution architectures still underperform attention by up to 2.1\nperplexity points on the Pile. In fine-grained analysis, we find 82% of the gap\nis explained by each model's ability to recall information that is previously\nmentioned in-context, e.g. \"Hakuna Matata means no worries Hakuna Matata it\nmeans no\" $\\rightarrow$ \"??\". On this task, termed \"associative recall\", we\nfind that attention outperforms gated-convolutions by a large margin: a 70M\nparameter attention model outperforms a 1.4 billion parameter gated-convolution\nmodel on associative recall. This is surprising because prior work shows gated\nconvolutions can perfectly solve synthetic tests for AR capability. To close\nthe gap between synthetics and real language, we develop a new formalization of\nthe task called multi-query associative recall (MQAR) that better reflects\nactual language. We perform an empirical and theoretical study of MQAR that\nelucidates differences in the parameter-efficiency of attention and\ngated-convolution recall. Informed by our analysis, we evaluate simple\nconvolution-attention hybrids and show that hybrids with input-dependent sparse\nattention patterns can close 97.4% of the gap to attention, while maintaining\nsub-quadratic scaling.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. Visual Dynamics: Probabilistic Future Frame Synthesis via Cross Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic convolution*\n\n*William T. Freeman, Katherine L. Bouman, Jiajun Wu, Tianfan Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of synthesizing a number of likely future frames from a\nsingle input image. In contrast to traditional methods, which have tackled this\nproblem in a deterministic or non-parametric way, we propose a novel approach\nthat models future frames in a probabilistic manner. Our probabilistic model\nmakes it possible for us to sample and synthesize many possible future frames\nfrom a single input image. Future frame synthesis is challenging, as it\ninvolves low- and high-level image and motion understanding. We propose a novel\nnetwork structure, namely a Cross Convolutional Network to aid in synthesizing\nfuture frames; this network structure encodes image and motion information as\nfeature maps and convolutional kernels, respectively. In experiments, our model\nperforms well on synthetic data, such as 2D shapes and animated game sprites,\nas well as on real-wold videos. We also show that our model can be applied to\ntasks such as visual analogy-making, and present an analysis of the learned\nnetwork representations.\n\n**Conference:** visual-dynamics-probabilistic-future-frame-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. Searching Efficient 3D Architectures with Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional architectures*\n\n*Song Han, Yujun Lin, Haotian Tang, Hanrui Wang, Shengyu Zhao, Zhijian Liu, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-driving cars need to understand 3D scenes efficiently and accurately in order to drive safely. Given the limited hardware resources, existing 3D perception models are not able to recognize small instances (e.g., pedestrians, cyclists) very well due to the low-resolution voxelization and aggressive downsampling. To this end, we propose Sparse Point-Voxel Convolution (SPVConv), a lightweight 3D module that equips the vanilla Sparse Convolution with the high-resolution point-based branch. With negligible overhead, this point-based branch is able to preserve the fine details even from large outdoor scenes. To explore the spectrum of efficient 3D models, we first define a flexible architecture design space based on SPVConv, and we then present 3D Neural Architecture Search (3D-NAS) to search the optimal network architecture over this diverse design space efficiently and effectively. Experimental results validate that the resulting SPVNAS model is fast and accurate: it outperforms the state-of-the-art MinkowskiNet by 3.3%, ranking 1st on the competitive SemanticKITTI leaderboard. It also achieves 8x computation reduction and 3x measured speedup over MinkowskiNet with higher accuracy. Finally, we transfer our method to 3D object detection, and it achieves consistent improvements over the one-stage detection baseline on KITTI.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Octree Generating Networks: Efficient Convolutional Architectures for High-resolution 3D Outputs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional architectures*\n\n*Thomas Brox, Maxim Tatarchenko, Alexey Dosovitskiy*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a deep convolutional decoder architecture that can generate\nvolumetric 3D outputs in a compute- and memory-efficient manner by using an\noctree representation. The network learns to predict both the structure of the\noctree, and the occupancy values of individual cells. This makes it a\nparticularly valuable technique for generating 3D shapes. In contrast to\nstandard decoders acting on regular voxel grids, the architecture does not have\ncubic complexity. This allows representing much higher resolution outputs with\na limited memory budget. We demonstrate this in several application domains,\nincluding 3D convolutional autoencoders, generation of objects and whole scenes\nfrom high-level representations, and shape from a single image.\n\n**Conference:** octree-generating-networks-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-28\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Their success on this task is often linked to their ability to\ncapture unbounded context. In this paper we develop a finite context approach\nthrough stacked convolutions, which can be more efficient since they allow\nparallelization over sequential tokens. We propose a novel simplified gating\nmechanism that outperforms Oord et al (2016) and investigate the impact of key\narchitectural decisions. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art on the\nWikiText-103 benchmark, even though it features long-term dependencies, as well\nas competitive results on the Google Billion Words benchmark.

We proposed Megabyte, a multi-scale decoder architecture that enables end-to-end differentiable modeling of sequences of over one million bytes. Megabyte segments sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches. This enables sub-quadratic self-attention, much larger feedforward layers for the same compute, and improved parallelism during decoding -- unlocking better performance at reduced cost for both training and generation. Extensive experiments show that Megabyte allows byte-level models to perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling, achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on ImageNet, and model audio from raw files.

In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/27 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition, pages 10819-10829, 2022.

Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

The DoG step sizes depend on simple empirical quantities (distance from the initial point and norms of gradients) and have no ``learning rate'' parameter. Theoretically, we show that a slight variation of the DoG formula enjoys strong parameter-free convergence guarantees for stochastic convex optimization assuming only \\emph{locally bounded} stochastic gradients. Empirically, we consider a broad range of vision and language transfer learning tasks, and show that DoG's performance is close to that of SGD with tuned learning rate. We also propose a per-layer variant of DoG that generally outperforms tuned SGD, approaching the performance of tuned Adam.

Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: optimized dynamic convolution implementation*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Specifically, we consider discrete-time stochastic dynamic models, as they are of particular interest in practical applications such as estimation and control. However, these aspects exacerbate the challenge of guaranteeing stability. Our method works by embedding a Lyapunov neural network into the dynamic model, thereby inherently satisfying the stability criterion. To this end, we propose two approaches and apply them in both the deterministic and stochastic settings: one exploits convexity of the Lyapunov function, while the other enforces stability through an implicit output layer. We demonstrate the utility of each approach through numerical examples.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. GradInit: Learning to Initialize Neural Networks for Stable and Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: numerically stable dynamic convolution*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Renkun Ni, Zheng Xu, Kezhi Kong, W. R. Huang, T. Goldstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** GradInit is an automated and architecture agnostic method for initializing neural networks based on a simple heuristic; the norm of each network layer is adjusted so that a single step of SGD or Adam with prescribed hyperparameters results in the smallest possible loss value.\n\n**Abstract:** Innovations in neural architectures have fostered significant breakthroughs in language modeling and computer vision. Unfortunately, novel architectures often result in challenging hyper-parameter choices and training instability if the network parameters are not properly initialized. A number of architecture-specific initialization schemes have been proposed, but these schemes are not always portable to new architectures. This paper presents GradInit, an automated and architecture agnostic method for initializing neural networks. GradInit is based on a simple heuristic; the norm of each network layer is adjusted so that a single step of SGD or Adam with prescribed hyperparameters results in the smallest possible loss value. This adjustment is done by introducing a scalar multiplier variable in front of each parameter block, and then optimizing these variables using a simple numerical scheme. GradInit accelerates the convergence and test performance of many convolutional architectures, both with or without skip connections, and even without normalization layers. It also improves the stability of the original Transformer architecture for machine translation, enabling training it without learning rate warmup using either Adam or SGD under a wide range of learning rates and momentum coefficients.

ScaleCrafter: Tuning-free Higher-Resolution Visual Generation with Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: numerically stable dynamic convolution*\n\n*Yin-Yin He, Shaoshu Yang, Haoxin Chen, Xiaodong Cun, Menghan Xia, Yong Zhang, Xintao Wang, Ran He, Qifeng Chen, Ying Shan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the capability of generating images from pre-trained diffusion models at much higher resolutions than the training image sizes and proposes the dispersed convolution and noise-damped classifier-free guidance, which can enable ultra-high-resolution image generation.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we investigate the capability of generating images from pre-trained diffusion models at much higher resolutions than the training image sizes. In addition, the generated images should have arbitrary image aspect ratios. When generating images directly at a higher resolution, 1024 x 1024, with the pre-trained Stable Diffusion using training images of resolution 512 x 512, we observe persistent problems of object repetition and unreasonable object structures. Existing works for higher-resolution generation, such as attention-based and joint-diffusion approaches, cannot well address these issues. As a new perspective, we examine the structural components of the U-Net in diffusion models and identify the crucial cause as the limited perception field of convolutional kernels. Based on this key observation, we propose a simple yet effective re-dilation that can dynamically adjust the convolutional perception field during inference. We further propose the dispersed convolution and noise-damped classifier-free guidance, which can enable ultra-high-resolution image generation (e.g., 4096 x 4096). Notably, our approach does not require any training or optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can address the repetition issue well and achieve state-of-the-art performance on higher-resolution image synthesis, especially in texture details. Our work also suggests that a pre-trained diffusion model trained on low-resolution images can be directly used for high-resolution visual generation without further tuning, which may provide insights for future research on ultra-high-resolution image and video synthesis.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 44  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 7. DyVal: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Reasoning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: benchmarking dynamic convolution in language models*\n\n*Kaijie Zhu, Jiaao Chen, Jindong Wang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Diyi Yang, Xing Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** DyVal is introduced, a general and flexible protocol for dynamic evaluation of LLMs that builds graph-informed DyVal by leveraging the structural advantage of directed acyclic graphs to dynamically generate evaluation samples with controllable complexities.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various evaluation benchmarks. However, concerns are raised about potential data contamination in their considerable volume of training corpus. Moreover, the static nature and fixed complexity of current benchmarks may inadequately gauge the advancing capabilities of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DyVal, a general and flexible protocol for dynamic evaluation of LLMs. Based on our framework, we build graph-informed DyVal by leveraging the structural advantage of directed acyclic graphs to dynamically generate evaluation samples with controllable complexities. DyVal generates challenging evaluation sets on reasoning tasks including mathematics, logical reasoning, and algorithm problems. We evaluate various LLMs ranging from Flan-T5-large to GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. Experiments show that LLMs perform worse in DyVal-generated evaluation samples with different complexities, highlighting the significance of dynamic evaluation. We also analyze the failure cases and results of different prompting methods. Moreover, DyVal-generated samples are not only evaluation sets, but also helpful data for fine-tuning to improve the performance of LLMs on existing benchmarks. We hope that DyVal can shed light on future evaluation research of LLMs. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/promptbench.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. NPHardEval: Dynamic Benchmark on Reasoning Ability of Large Language Models via Complexity Classes\n\n*From Search Query: benchmarking dynamic convolution in language models*\n\n*Lizhou Fan, Wenyue Hua, Lingyao Li, Haoyang Ling, Yongfeng Zhang, Libby Hemphill*\n\n**TL;DR:** Light is shed on the current state of reasoning in LLMs, providing an objective and rigorous perspective through the comparison of LLMs' performance across complex classes, and introduces a new benchmark, named NPHardEval.\n\n**Abstract:** Complex reasoning ability is one of the most important features of current LLMs, which has also been leveraged to play an integral role in complex decision-making tasks. Therefore, the investigation into the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical: numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the reasoning abilities of LLMs. However, current benchmarks are inadequate in offering a rigorous evaluation of the full extent of reasoning abilities that LLMs are capable of achieving. They are also prone to the risk of overfitting, as these benchmarks, being publicly accessible and static, allow models to potentially tailor their responses to specific benchmark metrics, thereby inflating their performance. Addressing these limitations, our research introduces a new benchmark, named NPHardEval. This benchmark is designed to evaluate the reasoning abilities of LLMs across a broad spectrum of 900 algorithmic questions, extending up to the NP-Hard complexity class. These questions are meticulously chosen to represent a wide range of complexity class below the NP-hard complexity class, offering a rigorous measure of the reasoning ability of LLMs. Through this study, we shed light on the current state of reasoning in LLMs, providing an objective and rigorous perspective through the comparison of LLMs' performance across complex classes. Moreover, this benchmark is designed with a dynamic update mechanism, where the datapoints are refreshed on a monthly basis. Such regular updates play a crucial role in mitigating the risk of LLMs overfitting to the benchmark, promoting a more accurate and reliable assessment of their reasoning capabilities.

In this work, we perform a detailed study of the factuality of LLM-generated text in the context of answering questions that test current world knowledge. Specifically, we introduce FreshQA, a novel dynamic QA benchmark encompassing a diverse range of question and answer types, including questions that require fast-changing world knowledge as well as questions with false premises that need to be debunked. We benchmark a diverse array of both closed and open-source LLMs under a two-mode evaluation procedure that allows us to measure both correctness and hallucination. Through human evaluations involving more than 50K judgments, we shed light on limitations of these models and demonstrate significant room for improvement: for instance, all models (regardless of model size) struggle on questions that involve fast-changing knowledge and false premises. Motivated by these results, we present FreshPrompt, a simple few-shot prompting method that substantially boosts the performance of an LLM on FreshQA by incorporating relevant and up-to-date information retrieved from a search engine into the prompt. Our experiments show that FreshPrompt outperforms both competing search engine-augmented prompting methods such as Self-Ask (Press et al., 2022) as well as commercial systems such as Perplexity.AI. Further analysis of FreshPrompt reveals that both the number of retrieved evidences and their order play a key role in influencing the correctness of LLM-generated answers. Additionally, instructing the LLM to generate concise and direct answers helps reduce hallucination compared to encouraging more verbose answers. To facilitate future work, we release FreshQA at github.com/freshllms/freshqa and commit to updating it at regular intervals.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 120  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

To be robust to dynamic illumination, the proposed system employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph neural network (GNN) to detect and match reliable and informative corner points. Then point feature matching results and the distribution of point and line features are utilized to match and triangulate lines. By accelerating CNN and GNN parts and optimizing the pipeline, the proposed system is able to run in real-time on low-power embedded platforms. The proposed VO was evaluated on several datasets with varying illumination conditions, and the results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art VO systems in terms of accuracy and robustness. The open-source nature of the proposed system allows for easy implementation and customization by the research community, enabling further development and improvement of VO for various applications.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Improving data-driven global weather prediction using deep convolutional neural networks on a cubed sphere\n\n*From Search Query: numerically stable dynamic convolution*\n\n*Jonathan A. Weyn, Dale R. Durran, Rich Caruana*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a significantly-improved data-driven global weather forecasting framework using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to forecast several basic atmospheric variables on a global grid. New developments in this framework include an offline volume-conservative mapping to a cubed-sphere grid, improvements to the CNN architecture, and the minimization of the loss function over multiple steps in a prediction sequence. The cubed-sphere remapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution operations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding in the CNN. Our improved model produces weather forecasts that are indefinitely stable and produce realistic weather patterns at lead times of several weeks and longer. For short- to medium-range forecasting, our model significantly outperforms persistence, climatology, and a coarse-resolution dynamical numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Unsurprisingly, our forecasts are worse than those from a high-resolution state-of-the-art operational NWP system. Our data-driven model is able to learn to forecast complex surface temperature patterns from few input atmospheric state variables. On annual time scales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the prescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it is currently less accurate than operational weather forecasting models, our data-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine learning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-15\n\n\n\n#### 4. A Greedy Algorithm for Quantizing Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: numerically stable dynamic convolution*\n\n*Rayan Saab, Eric Lybrand*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new computationally efficient method for quantizing the weights of pre- trained neural networks that is general enough to handle both multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. Our method deterministically quantizes layers in an iterative fashion with no complicated re-training required. Specifically, we quantize each neuron, or hidden unit, using a greedy path-following algorithm. This simple algorithm is equivalent to running a dynamical system, which we prove is stable for quantizing a single-layer neural network (or, alternatively, for quantizing the first layer of a multi-layer network) when the training data are Gaussian. We show that under these assumptions, the quantization error decays with the width of the layer, i.e., its level of over-parametrization. We provide numerical experiments, on multi-layer networks, to illustrate the performance of our methods on MNIST and CIFAR10 data, as well as for quantizing the VGG16 network using ImageNet data.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-29\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data. Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks. Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA & OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models. These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems.

In contrast to current\nmodels which assume a fixed spatio-temporal receptive field or simple temporal\naveraging for sequential processing, recurrent convolutional models are \"doubly\ndeep\"' in that they can be compositional in spatial and temporal \"layers\". Such\nmodels may have advantages when target concepts are complex and/or training\ndata are limited. Learning long-term dependencies is possible when\nnonlinearities are incorporated into the network state updates. Long-term RNN\nmodels are appealing in that they directly can map variable-length inputs\n(e.g., video frames) to variable length outputs (e.g., natural language text)\nand can model complex temporal dynamics; yet they can be optimized with\nbackpropagation. Our recurrent long-term models are directly connected to\nmodern visual convnet models and can be jointly trained to simultaneously learn\ntemporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. Our results\nshow such models have distinct advantages over state-of-the-art models for\nrecognition or generation which are separately defined and/or optimized.\n\n**Conference:** long-term-recurrent-convolutional-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2014-11-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, several key areas need to be addressed: efficient hardware utilization, advanced convolution techniques, integration with attention mechanisms, and ensuring numerical stability and scalability.\n\n### Efficient Hardware Utilization\n\n- **Tensor Cores and GPU Optimization**: Modern deep learning frameworks are optimized for the latest hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, which can significantly accelerate matrix multiplications and other tensor operations. Utilizing tensor cores in GPUs, as mentioned in the guides on efficient deep learning, can accelerate GEMM operations, which are crucial for convolutional and attention mechanisms.\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: The use of memristor-based in-memory computing can provide a 10\u00d7 acceleration for transformer self-attention compared to digital counterparts, highlighting the potential for specialized hardware to enhance performance and efficiency.\n\n### Advanced Convolution Techniques\n\n- **Dynamic Convolutions**: Dynamic convolutions can adaptively adjust the receptive fields based on input features, enhancing flexibility and efficiency. This technique can leverage sparsity in input data to skip unnecessary computations, leading to faster inference on GPUs.\n- **Multi-Scale and Hierarchical Architectures**: Techniques like dilated convolutions and dynamic multi-scale filters can capture long-range dependencies without increasing the parameter count, making them suitable for language models where context length is significant. These architectures can be integrated into the Conv GAU to enhance its ability to model both local and global dependencies.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hybrid GAUs**: Combining dynamic convolutions with attention mechanisms allows the model to benefit from both local feature extraction and global context modeling. This integration can be designed such that the Conv GAU processes local information while attention mechanisms handle long-range dependencies.\n- **Optimized Attention Mechanisms**: Optimizations like those in LightSeq, which include fused kernels for GPU and efficient memory management, can be adapted for integrating attention mechanisms with convolutional operations.\n\n### Numerical Stability and Training Methods\n\n- **Mixed Precision Training**: Utilizing lower-precision data types (e.g., FP16) can accelerate computation and reduce memory usage without significantly impacting model accuracy. This is particularly useful when training models with complex convolutional operations.\n- **Large-Batch Optimization**: Adjusting learning rates and batch sizes appropriately ensures stable convergence when training models with complex convolutional operations. Specific normalization techniques and initialization strategies can help prevent numerical instability when introducing dynamic parameters.\n\n### Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Kernel Fusion and Memory Coalescing**: Techniques like kernel fusion and memory coalescing can reduce the overhead of kernel launches and improve memory bandwidth utilization, crucial for high-performance convolution operations.\n- **GAU Compliance**: Any modifications to the Conv GAU should comply with the GAUBase class to ensure compatibility with the overall model architecture.\n\n### Key Insights and References\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**:\n  - The use of dynamic computational graphs in frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.x allows for more flexibility and easier debugging, which is crucial for rapid iteration and model experimentation.\n  - Memristor-based accelerators can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer self-attention, highlighting the potential for specialized hardware.\n\n- **Efficient Convolution Implementations**:\n  - Dynamic convolutions and multi-scale architectures can be optimized by precomputing certain operations and minimizing dynamic computations during runtime. This can be seen in works like \"Dynamic Convolutions: Exploiting Spatial Sparsity for Faster Inference\".\n\n- **Integration with Attention**:\n  - Combining convolutional GAUs with attention mechanisms can be optimized using techniques from libraries like LightSeq, which includes optimizations for GPUs and efficient memory management.\n\n- **Training and Optimization**:\n  - Mixed precision training and large-batch optimization are key strategies for training models with complex convolutional operations efficiently. These strategies ensure stable convergence and reduce computational overhead.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further solidify the proposal, the following areas should be explored:\n\n- **Detailed Implementation Techniques**:\n  - Search for code repositories or libraries that provide optimized implementations of dynamic convolutions and multi-scale architectures.\n  - Investigate existing models that have successfully implemented similar techniques, analyzing their code and performance optimizations.\n\n- **Benchmarking and Empirical Studies**:\n  - Examine empirical results comparing dynamic convolutions, multi-scale architectures, and their integration with attention mechanisms in language models.\n  - Look for studies that quantify the performance gains and trade-offs associated with these techniques.\n\n- **Numerical Stability and Training Methods**:\n  - Research methods to prevent or mitigate numerical instability when introducing dynamic parameters, such as specific normalization techniques or initialization strategies.\n  - Explore learning rate schedules and regularization methods suitable for training models with complex convolutional operations.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather the necessary information to design a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages state-of-the-art convolutional methods, efficient hardware utilization, and robust training strategies.\n",

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

This approach can be adapted for language models to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hybrid GAUs**: Combining dynamic convolutions with attention mechanisms, as suggested in the analysis, can leverage both local feature extraction and global context modeling. For example, the \"Mega\" model by Ma et al. uses a single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with exponential moving averages, which can be integrated with dynamic convolutions to enhance performance.\n- **Block-State Transformers**: Fathi et al.'s \"Block-State Transformers\" propose a hybrid layer combining an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation, which can be a model for integrating dynamic convolutions and attention.\n\n### Numerical Stability and Training Methods\n\n- **Quantization Techniques**: Methods like PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) and Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ) from Chen et al.'s work ensure efficient and accurate quantization of convolution operations, which is crucial for maintaining numerical stability during training.\n- **Mixed Precision Training and Large-Batch Optimization**: Utilizing mixed precision training and large-batch optimization techniques can accelerate computation and ensure stable convergence, as highlighted in the analysis.\n\n### Efficient Hardware Utilization\n\n- **GPU Optimization and Tensor Cores**: Leveraging GPU optimization techniques, such as kernel fusion and memory coalescing, and utilizing tensor cores can significantly accelerate matrix multiplications and tensor operations, which are crucial for convolutional and attention mechanisms.\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: Exploring the use of memristor-based accelerators can offer potential for specialized hardware to enhance performance and efficiency in transformer self-attention and convolution operations.\n\n### Scalability and Memory Efficiency\n\n- **Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling**: The approach by Zhu et al. to eliminate matrix multiplication operations can significantly reduce memory usage during training and inference, making the model more scalable.\n- **Sub-Quadratic Self-Attention**: Architectures that support sub-quadratic self-attention, such as the multi-scale decoder architecture in \"MEGABYTE,\" can enhance scalability by improving parallelism during decoding.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: The concept of multi-scale feature extraction, as seen in the \"MSTA3D\" paper for 3D instance segmentation, can be adapted for language models to capture diverse information across different scales. This involves using multi-scale features and twin-attention mechanisms to effectively harness information.\n- **Deformable Convolutions**: The \"FlowDCN\" model introduces a novel approach to decouple the scale and direction prediction of deformable convolution, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. This can be a valuable technique for adapting to different input scales and capturing long-range dependencies in language models.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo solidify the proposal, the following steps are recommended:\n\n- **Detailed Implementation Strategies**: Explore code repositories and implementations of dynamic and multi-scale convolutions optimized for GPUs, such as those provided in frameworks like NVIDIA CUDA and cuDNN.\n- **In-depth Study of Numerical Stability Techniques**: Research advanced methods for ensuring numerical stability, including the application of Lyapunov functions and stability analysis in dynamic neural networks.\n- **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking**: Analyze benchmarks comparing dynamic convolutions, multi-scale architectures, and hybrid models to quantify performance gains and trade-offs.\n- **Integration Considerations**: Design a detailed implementation plan ensuring that modifications to the Conv GAU comply with the GAUBase class and maintain compatibility with the overall architecture.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and integrating the insights from the referenced papers, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that is efficient, scalable, and outperforms current state-of-the-art models.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/67 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1511.05946, 2015.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Revisiting Dynamic Convolution via Matrix Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: optimized dynamic convolution implementation*\n\n*Yunsheng Li, Yinpeng Chen, Xiyang Dai, Mengchen Liu, Dongdong Chen, Ye Yu, Lu Yuan, Zicheng Liu, Mei Chen, N. Vasconcelos*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space, and the proposed dynamic channel fusion enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space and mitigates the joint optimization difficulty.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research in dynamic convolution shows substantial performance boost for efficient CNNs, due to the adaptive aggregation of K static convolution kernels.It has two limitations: (a) it increases the number of convolutional weights by K-times, and (b) the joint optimization of dynamic attention and static convolution kernels is challenging. In this paper, we revisit it from a new perspective of matrix decomposition and reveal the key issue is that dynamic convolution applies dynamic attentions over channel groups after projecting into a higher dimensional intermediate space. To address this issue, we propose dynamic channel fusion to replace dynamic attentions over channel groups. Dynamic channel fusion not only enables significant dimension reduction of the intermediate space, but also mitigates the joint optimization difficulty. As a result, our method is easier to train and requires significantly fewer parameters without sacrificing accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. DoG is SGD's Best Friend: A Parameter-Free Dynamic Step Size Schedule\n\n*From Search Query: optimized dynamic convolution implementation*\n\n*Maor Ivgi, Oliver Hinder, Y. Carmon*\n\n**TL;DR:** A per-layer variant of DoG is proposed that generally outperforms tuned SGD, approaching the performance of tuned Adam.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a tuning-free dynamic SGD step size formula, which we call Distance over Gradients (DoG). The DoG step sizes depend on simple empirical quantities (distance from the initial point and norms of gradients) and have no ``learning rate'' parameter. Theoretically, we show that a slight variation of the DoG formula enjoys strong parameter-free convergence guarantees for stochastic convex optimization assuming only \\emph{locally bounded} stochastic gradients. Empirically, we consider a broad range of vision and language transfer learning tasks, and show that DoG's performance is close to that of SGD with tuned learning rate. We also propose a per-layer variant of DoG that generally outperforms tuned SGD, approaching the performance of tuned Adam.

Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: optimized dynamic convolution implementation*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we present an effective convolutional attention network for the MLDC problem with a focus on medical code prediction from clinical documents. Our innovations are three-fold: (1) we utilize a deep convolution-based encoder with the squeeze-and-excitation networks and residual networks to aggregate the information across the document and learn meaningful document representations that cover different ranges of texts; (2) we explore multi-layer and sum-pooling attention to extract the most informative features from these multi-scale representations; (3) we combine binary cross entropy loss and focal loss to improve performance for rare labels. We focus our evaluation study on MIMIC-III, a widely used dataset in the medical domain. Our models outperform prior work on medical coding and achieve new state-of-the-art results on multiple metrics. We also demonstrate the language independent nature of our approach by applying it to two non-English datasets.

Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale convolution language models*\n\n*Yao Fu, Hao-Chun Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal, Tushar Khot*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows two important aspects of model abilities: there exists a very complex balance/ tradeoff between language models' multi-dimensional abilities, and by paying the price of decreased generic ability, it can clearly lift up the scaling curve of models smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability.\n\n**Abstract:** The surprising ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is believed to emerge only in very large-scale models (100+ billion parameters). We show that such abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT-3.5 ($\\ge$ 175B) to T5 variants ($\\le$ 11B). We propose model specialization, to specialize the model's ability towards a target task. The hypothesis is that large models (commonly viewed as larger than 100B) have strong modeling power, but are spread on a large spectrum of tasks. Small models (commonly viewed as smaller than 10B) have limited model capacity, but if we concentrate their capacity on a specific target task, the model can achieve a decent improved performance. We use multi-step math reasoning as our testbed because it is a very typical emergent ability. We show two important aspects of model abilities: (1). there exists a very complex balance/ tradeoff between language models' multi-dimensional abilities; (2). by paying the price of decreased generic ability, we can clearly lift up the scaling curve of models smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability. We further give comprehensive discussions about important design choices for better generalization, including the tuning data format, the start model checkpoint, and a new model selection method. We hope our practice and discoveries can serve as an important attempt towards specialized smaller models in the new research paradigm set by LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 186  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 6. Large Language Models as Commonsense Knowledge for Large-Scale Task Planning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale convolution language models*\n\n*Zirui Zhao, W. Lee, David Hsu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it, and proposes a new LLM-MCTS algorithm, which outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs by a wide margin.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale task planning is a major challenge. Recent work exploits large language models (LLMs) directly as a policy and shows surprisingly interesting results. This paper shows that LLMs provide a commonsense model of the world in addition to a policy that acts on it. The world model and the policy can be combined in a search algorithm, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), to scale up task planning. In our new LLM-MCTS algorithm, the LLM-induced world model provides a commonsense prior belief for MCTS to achieve effective reasoning; the LLM-induced policy acts as a heuristic to guide the search, vastly improving search efficiency. Experiments show that LLM-MCTS outperforms both MCTS alone and policies induced by LLMs (GPT2 and GPT3.5) by a wide margin, for complex, novel tasks. Further experiments and analyses on multiple tasks -- multiplication, multi-hop travel planning, object rearrangement -- suggest minimum description length (MDL) as a general guiding principle: if the description length of the world model is substantially smaller than that of the policy, using LLM as a world model for model-based planning is likely better than using LLM solely as a policy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7.

In spite of these advantages, widespread adoption of these models for real-time conversational use cases has been stymied by higher compute requirements and thus higher latency. In this work, we propose a non-autoregressive approach to predict semantic parse trees with an efficient seq2seq model architecture. By combining non-autoregressive prediction with convolutional neural networks, we achieve significant latency gains and parameter size reduction compared to traditional RNN models.

MaCow: Masked Convolutional Generative Flow\n\n*From Search Query: efficient convolutional architectures in autoregressive LMs*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, E. Hovy*\n\n**TL;DR:** MaCow is introduced, a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution, which achieves significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Abstract:** Flow-based generative models, conceptually attractive due to tractability of both the exact log-likelihood computation and latent-variable inference, and efficiency of both training and sampling, has led to a number of impressive empirical successes and spawned many advanced variants and theoretical investigations. Despite their computational efficiency, the density estimation performance of flow-based generative models significantly falls behind those of state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this work, we introduce masked convolutional generative flow (MaCow), a simple yet effective architecture of generative flow using masked convolution. By restricting the local connectivity in a small kernel, MaCow enjoys the properties of fast and stable training, and efficient sampling, while achieving significant improvements over Glow for density estimation on standard image benchmarks, considerably narrowing the gap to autoregressive models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 9.

So*\n\n**TL;DR:** EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the recent impressive accomplishments of language models (LMs) for code generation, we explore the use of LMs as adaptive mutation and crossover operators for an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. While NAS still proves too difficult a task for LMs to succeed at solely through prompting, we find that the combination of evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt-tuning, a method we term EvoPrompting, consistently finds diverse and high performing models. We first demonstrate that EvoPrompting is effective on the computationally efficient MNIST-1D dataset, where EvoPrompting produces convolutional architecture variants that outperform both those designed by human experts and naive few-shot prompting in terms of accuracy and model size. We then apply our method to searching for graph neural networks on the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, where EvoPrompting is able to design novel architectures that outperform current state-of-the-art models on 21 out of 30 algorithmic reasoning tasks while maintaining similar model size. EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

To be robust to dynamic illumination, the proposed system employs the convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph neural network (GNN) to detect and match reliable and informative corner points.

By accelerating CNN and GNN parts and optimizing the pipeline, the proposed system is able to run in real-time on low-power embedded platforms. The proposed VO was evaluated on several datasets with varying illumination conditions, and the results show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art VO systems in terms of accuracy and robustness.

Detecting Text in Natural Image with Connectionist Text Proposal Network\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale convolution language models*\n\n*Yu Qiao, Weilin Huang, Zhi Tian, Tong He, Pan He*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) that accurately\nlocalizes text lines in natural image. The CTPN detects a text line in a\nsequence of fine-scale text proposals directly in convolutional feature maps.\nWe develop a vertical anchor mechanism that jointly predicts location and\ntext/non-text score of each fixed-width proposal, considerably improving\nlocalization accuracy. The sequential proposals are naturally connected by a\nrecurrent neural network, which is seamlessly incorporated into the\nconvolutional network, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model.

Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale convolution language models*\n\n*Ming-Hsuan Yang, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Munawar Hayat, Salman Khan, Aditya Arora, Syed Waqas Zamir*\n\n**Abstract:** Since convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well at learning generalizable image priors from large-scale data, these models have been extensively applied to image restoration and related tasks. Recently, another class of neural architectures, Transformers, have shown significant performance gains on natural language and high-level vision tasks. While the Transformer model mitigates the shortcomings of CNNs (i.e., limited receptive field and inadaptability to input content), its computational complexity grows quadratically with the spatial resolution, therefore making it infeasible to apply to most image restoration tasks involving high-resolution images. In this work, we propose an efficient Transformer model by making several key designs in the building blocks (multi-head attention and feed-forward network) such that it can capture long-range pixel interactions, while still remaining applicable to large images. Our model, named Restoration Transformer (Restormer), achieves state-of-the-art results on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring (single-image and dual-pixel data), and image denoising (Gaussian grayscale/color denoising, and real image denoising).

This approach, as seen in \"Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\" by Wu et al., allows the model to adapt to different contexts and capture complex patterns efficiently.\n\n- **Efficiency and Parameter Reduction**: Techniques like dynamic channel fusion, discussed in \"Revisiting Dynamic Convolution via Matrix Decomposition\" by Li et al., can reduce the intermediate dimensionality and parameter count, making the model more efficient and easier to train.\n\n## Multi-Scale and Hierarchical Convolutions\n\n- **Dilated Convolutions**: Incorporating dilated convolutions, as proposed in \"Multi-Scale Context Aggregation by Dilated Convolutions\" by Yu and Koltun, allows for the efficient expansion of the receptive field without increasing the parameter count. This is essential for capturing long-range dependencies in language models.\n\n- **Dynamic Multi-Scale Filters**: The use of dynamic multi-scale filters, as described in \"Dynamic Multi-Scale Filters for Semantic Segmentation\" by Lian et al., can adaptively adjust the receptive fields to capture features at various scales effectively.\n\n## Numerical Stability and Optimization\n\n- **Quantization and Optimization Techniques**: Ensuring numerical stability during convolution operations is critical. Techniques such as PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) and Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ) can be applied to maintain stability. Proper initialization of dynamic parameters and the use of stable activation functions are also essential.\n\n- **Optimization Algorithms**: The use of optimization algorithms like differential evolution, as seen in the optimization of fractional-order convolutional neural networks, can help in identifying optimal parameters and enhancing the model\u2019s convergence and accuracy.\n\n## Hardware Optimization\n\n- **Kernel Fusion and Memory Alignment**: Optimizing convolutional operations for hardware efficiency involves techniques like kernel fusion and memory alignment. These methods reduce overhead and enhance bandwidth utilization, as discussed in \"Optimizing Convolutional Operations in Language Models for GPUs\".\n\n- **Utilizing Tensor Cores**: Leveraging tensor cores can significantly accelerate matrix multiplications and convolution operations, improving computational efficiency. This is particularly relevant for large-scale language models.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining dynamic convolutions with attention mechanisms can provide a balanced approach to local and global context modeling. The Block-State Transformer (BST) architecture, which combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation, is a promising example.\n\n- **Gated Mechanisms**: Integrating gated attention mechanisms, such as in the Mega model, can further enhance performance by allowing the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence.\n\n## Scalability and Memory Efficiency\n\n- **Efficient Implementations**: Using efficient convolutional architectures like depthwise separable convolutions and grouped convolutions can reduce computational complexity and memory footprint, enabling better scalability to longer sequences and larger models.\n\n- **Maintaining GAU Compliance**: Any modifications to the Conv GAU should adhere to the GAUBase class specifications to ensure compatibility within the hierarchical structure of GAUs.\n\n### Key References\n\n1. **Wu, F., Fan, A., Baevski, A., Dauphin, Y., & Auli, M.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus.

Curvature-guided dynamic scale networks for Multi-view Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution GAUs*\n\n*Khang Truong Giang, Soohwan Song, Sungho Jo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet, composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface, which improves the completeness of reconstructed models.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task for precise 3D reconstruction. Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

DSTAGNN: Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution GAUs*\n\n*Shiyong Lan, Yitong Ma, Wei Huang, Wenwu Wang, Hongyu Yang, P. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network and design a novel graph neural network architecture that can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a typical problem in time series analysis, traffic flow prediction is one of the most important application fields of machine learning. However, achieving highly accurate tra ffi c flow prediction is a challenging task, due to the presence of complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies within a road network. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 3. Unsupervised Optical Flow Estimation with Dynamic Timing Representation for Spike Camera\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution GAUs*\n\n*Lujie Xia, Ziluo Ding, Rui Zhao, Jiyuan Zhang, Lei Ma, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang, Ruiqin Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** An unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data is proposed and can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently selecting an appropriate spike stream data length to extract precise information is the key to the spike vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\\%$ and $19\\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\\Delta t=10$ and $\\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design and implement a novel autoregressive language model block, specifically the **DynamicMultiScaleConvGAU**, which integrates dynamic and multi-scale convolutional techniques within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs).

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling for Long-term Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution transformers*\n\n*Huiqiang Wang, Jian Peng, Feihu Huang, Jince Wang, Junhui Chen, Yifei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels, and is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformer-based methods have achieved surprising performance in the field of long-term series forecasting, but the attention mechanism for computing global correlations entails high complexity. And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Curvature-guided dynamic scale networks for Multi-view Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution transformers*\n\n*Khang Truong Giang, Soohwan Song, Sungho Jo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet, composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface, which improves the completeness of reconstructed models.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task for precise 3D reconstruction. Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution transformers*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Label-Specific Dual Graph Neural Network for Multi-Label Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive convolution language models*\n\n*Qianwen Ma, Chunyuan Yuan, Wei Zhou, Songlin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel label-specific dual graph neural network (LDGN), which incorporates category information to learn label- specific components from documents, and employs dual Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-label text classification is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing. Previous studies have difficulties to distinguish similar labels well because they learn the same document representations for different labels, that is they do not explicitly extract label-specific semantic components from documents. Moreover, they do not fully explore the high-order interactions among these semantic components, which is very helpful to predict tail labels. In this paper, we propose a novel label-specific dual graph neural network (LDGN), which incorporates category information to learn label-specific components from documents, and employs dual Graph Convolution Network (GCN) to model complete and adaptive interactions among these components based on the statistical label co-occurrence and dynamic reconstruction graph in a joint way. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that LDGN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models, and also achieves better performance with respect to tail labels.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 5. Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive convolution language models*\n\n*Vasileios Lioutas, Yuhong Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions is introduced, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix.\n\n**Abstract:** To date, most state-of-the-art sequence modeling architectures use attention to build generative models for language based tasks. Some of these models use all the available sequence tokens to generate an attention distribution which results in time complexity of $O(n^2)$. Alternatively, they utilize depthwise convolutions with softmax normalized kernels of size $k$ acting as a limited-window self-attention, resulting in time complexity of $O(k{\\cdot}n)$. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Large Kernel (TaLK) Convolutions, a novel adaptive convolution operation that learns to predict the size of a summation kernel instead of using a fixed-sized kernel matrix. This method yields a time complexity of $O(n)$, effectively making the sequence encoding process linear to the number of tokens. We evaluate the proposed method on large-scale standard machine translation, abstractive summarization and language modeling datasets and show that TaLK Convolutions constitute an efficient improvement over other attention/convolution based approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth: Revealing the Behavior of Large Language Models in Knowledge Conflicts\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive convolution language models*\n\n*Jian Xie, Kai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Renze Lou, Yu Su*\n\n**TL;DR:** This first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts is presented, and it is found that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing.\n\n**Abstract:** By providing external information to large language models (LLMs), tool augmentation (including retrieval augmentation) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs' static parametric memory. However, how receptive are LLMs to such external evidence, especially when the evidence conflicts with their parametric memory? We present the first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts. We propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from LLMs and construct the corresponding counter-memory, which enables us to conduct a series of controlled experiments. Our investigation reveals seemingly contradicting behaviors of LLMs. On the one hand, different from prior wisdom, we find that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing. On the other hand, LLMs also demonstrate a strong confirmation bias when the external evidence contains some information that is consistent with their parametric memory, despite being presented with conflicting evidence at the same time. These results pose important implications that are worth careful consideration for the further development and deployment of tool- and retrieval-augmented LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/LLM-Knowledge-Conflict.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 7. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient convolutions*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient convolutions*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution transformers*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Shiyu Chang, Yifan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful \"universal\" models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics.

DenoDet: Attention as Deformable Multi-Subspace Feature Denoising for Target Detection in SAR Images\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution transformers*\n\n*Jian Yang, Kang Ni, Xiang Li, YuXuan Li, Minrui Zou, Yimian Dai*\n\n**Abstract:** Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) target detection has long been impeded by inherent speckle noise and the prevalence of diminutive, ambiguous targets. While deep neural networks have advanced SAR target detection, their intrinsic low-frequency bias and static post-training weights falter with coherent noise and preserving subtle details across heterogeneous terrains. Motivated by traditional SAR image denoising, we propose DenoDet, a network aided by explicit frequency domain transform to calibrate convolutional biases and pay more attention to high-frequencies, forming a natural multi-scale subspace representation to detect targets from the perspective of multi-subspace denoising. We design TransDeno, a dynamic frequency domain attention module that performs as a transform domain soft thresholding operation, dynamically denoising across subspaces by preserving salient target signals and attenuating noise. To adaptively adjust the granularity of subspace processing, we also propose a deformable group fully-connected layer (DeGroFC) that dynamically varies the group conditioned on the input features. Without bells and whistles, our plug-and-play TransDeno sets state-of-the-art scores on multiple SAR target detection datasets.

AdaBelief Optimizer: Adapting Stepsizes by the Belief in Observed Gradients\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive convolution language models*\n\n*James S. Duncan, Xenophon Papademetris, Yifan Ding, Nicha Dvornek, Sekhar Tatikonda, Tommy Tang, Juntang Zhuang*\n\n**Abstract:** Most popular optimizers for deep learning can be broadly categorized as adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum). For many models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), adaptive methods typically converge faster but generalize worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), adaptive methods are typically the default because of their stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to the \"belief\" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction, we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples compared to a well-tuned Adam optimizer.

Sequencer: Deep LSTM for Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive convolution language models*\n\n*Masato Taki, Yuki Tatsunami*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent computer vision research, the advent of the Vision Transformer (ViT) has rapidly revolutionized various architectural design efforts: ViT achieved state-of-the-art image classification performance using self-attention found in natural language processing, and MLP-Mixer achieved competitive performance using simple multi-layer perceptrons. In contrast, several studies have also suggested that carefully redesigned convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can achieve advanced performance comparable to ViT without resorting to these new ideas. Against this background, there is growing interest in what inductive bias is suitable for computer vision. Here we propose Sequencer, a novel and competitive architecture alternative to ViT that provides a new perspective on these issues. Unlike ViTs, Sequencer models long-range dependencies using LSTMs rather than self-attention layers. We also propose a two-dimensional version of Sequencer module, where an LSTM is decomposed into vertical and horizontal LSTMs to enhance performance. Despite its simplicity, several experiments demonstrate that Sequencer performs impressively well: Sequencer2D-L, with 54M parameters, realizes 84.6% top-1 accuracy on only ImageNet-1K. Not only that, we show that it has good transferability and the robust resolution adaptability on double resolution-band.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-04\n\n\n\n#### 5. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient convolutions*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Tri Dao, Michael Zhang, Armin W. Thomas, Eric Nguyen, Elliot L. Epstein, Daniel Y. Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-13\n\n\n\n#### 6.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, De-huai Chen, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective convolutional model called Structured Global Convolution (SGConv), which exhibits strong empirical performance over several tasks and shows the potential to improve both efficiency and performance when plugging SGConv into standard language and vision models.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional models have been widely used in multiple domains. However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. [2021] proposed a model called S4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S4 is involved.

However, most existing models only use local convolution, making the model unable to handle long-range dependency efficiently. Attention overcomes this problem by aggregating global information based on the pair-wise attention score but also makes the computational complexity quadratic to the sequence length. Recently, Gu et al. 2021a proposed a model called S 4 inspired by the state space model. S4 can be efficiently implemented as a global convolutional model whose kernel size equals the input sequence length. With Fast Fourier Transform, S4 can model much longer sequences than Transformers and achieve significant gains over SoTA on several long-range tasks. Despite its empirical success, S 4 is involved. It requires sophisticated parameterization and initialization schemes that combine the wisdom from several prior works. As a result, S4 is less intuitive and hard to use for researchers with limited prior knowledge. Here we aim to demystify S4 and extract basic principles that contribute to the success of S4 as a global convolutional model.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution.

To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes.

Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, the **DynamicMultiScaleConvGAU**, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided analysis and external sources:\n\n## Key Concepts and Techniques\n\n### Dynamic Convolutions\n- The integration of dynamic convolutions is crucial for adapting the model to varying input sequences.

The primary goals are to improve the model's ability to capture both local and long-range dependencies efficiently while maintaining computational efficiency through hardware-optimized implementations. Initial searches have uncovered a variety of related works that explore dynamic and multi-scale convolutions in transformer architectures, state space models (SSMs), and hardware-efficient implementations. However, specific integrations of these techniques within GAUs for autoregressive language models appear to be relatively underexplored, indicating potential novelty in the proposed approach.\n\n2. **All Useful References with Excerpts:**\n\n   **Internal Library Sources:**\n\n   - **Eagle and Finch: RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence**\n     - *Bo Peng, Daniel Goldstein, Quentin Anthony, Alon Albalak, et al.*\n     - **Excerpt:**\n       > \"Comparing to existing works like perform linear attention transformers, Mamba trends to adopt the selective state space models with dynamic recurrence which makes it not easily parallelizable...

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

However, achieving highly accurate tra ffi c flow prediction is a challenging task, due to the presence of complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies within a road network. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 3.

To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\\%$ and $19\\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\\Delta t=10$ and $\\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Y.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential:

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling Long-Range Dependency (LRD) is a key challenge in long-sequence modeling tasks such as time-series forecasting, language modeling, and pixel-level image generation. Unfortunately, standard deep learning models fail to solve this problem for different reasons: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) suffers from vanishing gradient, Transformer has complexity quadratic in the sequence length, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) usually only has a local receptive field in each layer. A recently proposed benchmark called Long-Range Arena (LRA) Tay et al. 2020b reveals that all existing models perform poorly in modeling LRD. Notably, on one spatial-level sequence modeling task called Pathfinder-X from LRA, all models fail except a new Structured State Space sequence model (S4) Gu et al. 2021a. The S4 model is inspired by the state space model widely used in control theory and can be computed efficiently with a special parameterization based on the Cauchy kernel. The exact implementation of the S4 model can be viewed as a (depthwise) global convolutional model with an involved computation global convolution kernel. Thanks to the global receptive field of the convolution kernel, S4 is able to handle tasks that require LRD, such as Pathfinder Tay et al., 2020b, where classic local CNNs fail Linsley et al., 2018, Kim et al., 2019]. Also, the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and techniques from numerical linear algebra make the computational complexity of S 4 tractable compared to the quadratic complexity of attention. Together, S4 shows the potential of global convolutional models to model LRD and advances the SoTA on LRA. Despite its accomplishments, the delicate design of S4 makes it unfriendly even to knowledgable researchers. In particular, the empirical success of S4 relies on 1) A Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) parameterization whose efficient implementation requires several numerical linear algebra tricks, 2) An initialization scheme based on the HiPPO matrix derived in prior work Gu et al., 2020. Therefore, aiming to reduce the complications of the model and highlight minimal principles, we raise the following questions:\n\nWhat contributes to the success of the S4 model? Can we establish a simpler model based on minimal principles to handle long-range dependency? To answer these questions, we focus on the design of the global convolution kernel. We extract two simple and intuitive principles that contribute to the success of the S4 kernel. The first principle is that the parameterization of the global convolution kernel should be efficient in terms of the sequence length: the number of parameters should scale slowly with the sequence length. For example, classic CNNs use a fixed kernel size. S4 also uses a fixed number of parameters to compute the convolution kernel while the number is greater than classic CNNs. Both models satisfy the first principle as the number of parameters does not scale with input length. The efficiency of parameterization is also necessary because the naive implementation of a global convolution kernel with the size of sentence length is intractable for inputs with thousands of tokens. Too many parameters will also cause overfitting, thus hurting the performance. The second principle is the decaying structure of the convolution kernel, meaning that the weights for convolving with closer neighbors are larger than the more distant ones. This structure appears ubiquitously in signal processing, with the well-known Gaussian filter as an example. The intuition is clear that closer neighbors provide a more helpful signal. S4 inherently enjoys\nthis decaying property because of the exponential decay of the spectrum of matrix powers (See Figure 22), and we find this inductive bias improves the model performance (See Section 4.1.2). We show that these two principles are sufficient for designing a global convolutional model that captures LRD well. To verify this, we introduce a class of global convolution kernels with a simple multiscale structure, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we compose the convolution kernel by a sequence of subkernels of increasing sizes, yet every subkernel is upsampled from the same number of parameters. This parameterization ensures that the number of parameters only scales logarithmically to the input length, which satisfies the first principle. In addition, we add a decaying weight to each scale during the combination step and fulfill the second principle. We named our methods as Structural Global Convolution kernels (SGConv). Empirically, SGConv improves S4 by more than $1 \\%$ and achieves SoTA results on the LRA benchmark. On Speech Command datasets, SGConv achieves comparative results in the ten-class classification task and significantly better results in the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_de99aaee211b08088edeg-03.jpg?height=589&width=749&top_left_y=454&top_left_x=1038)\n\nFigure 1: Illustration of the parameterization used in SGConv (Eq.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous linear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that include positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms, tensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization. Specifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention dilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between tokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique that accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces memory usage by a remarkable four times. To further enhance the performance of TransNormer, we leverage a gating mechanism for smooth training and a new tensor normalization scheme to accelerate the model, resulting in an impressive acceleration of over $20\\%$. Furthermore, we develop a robust inference algorithm that ensures numerical stability and consistent inference speed, regardless of the sequence length, showcasing superior efficiency during both training and inference stages. We also implement an efficient model parallel schema for TransNormerLLM, enabling seamless deployment on large-scale clusters and facilitating expansion to even more extensive models, i.e., LLMs with 175B parameters. We validate our model design through a series of ablations and train models with sizes of 385M, 1B, and 7B on our self-collected corpus. Benchmark results demonstrate that our models not only match the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs with Transformer but are also significantly faster.

Curvature-guided dynamic scale networks for Multi-view Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution GAUs*\n\n*Khang Truong Giang, Soohwan Song, Sungho Jo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet, composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface, which improves the completeness of reconstructed models.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-view stereo (MVS) is a crucial task for precise 3D reconstruction. Most recent studies tried to improve the performance of matching cost volume in MVS by designing aggregated 3D cost volumes and their regularization. This paper focuses on learning a robust feature extraction network to enhance the performance of matching costs without heavy computation in the other steps. In particular, we present a dynamic scale feature extraction network, namely, CDSFNet. It is composed of multiple novel convolution layers, each of which can select a proper patch scale for each pixel guided by the normal curvature of the image surface. As a result, CDFSNet can estimate the optimal patch scales to learn discriminative features for accurate matching computation between reference and source images. By combining the robust extracted features with an appropriate cost formulation strategy, our resulting MVS architecture can estimate depth maps more precisely. Extensive experiments showed that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on complex outdoor scenes. It significantly improves the completeness of reconstructed models. As a result, the method can process higher resolution inputs within faster run-time and lower memory than other MVS methods.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network and design a novel graph neural network architecture that can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a typical problem in time series analysis, traffic flow prediction is one of the most important application fields of machine learning. However, achieving highly accurate tra ffi c flow prediction is a challenging task, due to the presence of complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies within a road network. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 168  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 3. Unsupervised Optical Flow Estimation with Dynamic Timing Representation for Spike Camera\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic multi-scale convolution GAUs*\n\n*Lujie Xia, Ziluo Ding, Rui Zhao, Jiyuan Zhang, Lei Ma, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang, Ruiqin Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** An unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data is proposed and can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently selecting an appropriate spike stream data length to extract precise information is the key to the spike vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic timing representation for spike streams. Based on multi-layers architecture, it applies dilated convolutions on temporal dimension to extract features on multi-temporal scales with few parameters. And we design layer attention to dynamically fuse these features. Moreover, we propose an unsupervised learning method for optical flow estimation in a spike-based manner to break the dependence on labeled data. In addition, to verify the robustness, we also build a spike-based synthetic validation dataset for extreme scenarios in autonomous driving, denoted as SSES dataset. It consists of various corner cases. Experiments show that our method can predict optical flow from spike streams in different high-speed scenes, including real scenes. For instance, our method gets $15\\%$ and $19\\%$ error reduction from the best spike-based work, SCFlow, in $\\Delta t=10$ and $\\Delta t=20$ respectively which are the same settings as the previous works.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Efficient and Accurate Winograd Convolution via Full Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Tianqi Chen, Weixiang Xu, Weihan Chen, Peisong Wang, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) is presented to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function and the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time.\n\n**Abstract:** The Winograd algorithm is an efficient convolution implementation, which performs calculations in the transformed domain. To further improve the computation efficiency, recent works propose to combine it with model quantization. Although Post-Training Quantization has the advantage of low computational cost and has been successfully applied in many other scenarios, a severe accuracy drop exists when utilizing it in Winograd convolution. Besides, despite the Winograd algorithm consisting of four stages, most existing methods only quantize the element-wise multiplication stage, leaving a considerable portion of calculations in full precision. In this paper, observing the inconsistency among different transformation procedures, we present PTQ-Aware Winograd (PAW) to optimize them collaboratively under a unified objective function. Moreover, we explore the full quantization of faster Winograd (tile size \u2265 4 ) for the first time. We further propose a hardware-friendly method called Factorized Scale Quantization (FSQ), which can effectively balance the significant range differences in the Winograd domain. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, e.g., with 8-bit quantization and a tile size of 6, our method outperforms the previous Winograd PTQ method by 8.27% and 5.38% in terms of the top-1 accuracy on ResNet-18 and ResNet-34, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized convolution GAUs*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block using dynamic and multi-scale convolutional techniques within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs), here are the key points and most relevant information from the provided analysis and external sources:\n\n## Key Objectives and Intent\n- **Enhance Efficiency and Expressiveness**: The researcher aims to improve the model's ability to capture both local and long-range dependencies efficiently.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Ensure that the enhancements do not introduce significant computational overhead and are optimized for hardware efficiency.\n- **Novelty and Contribution**: The integration of dynamic and multi-scale convolutions within GAUs is relatively unexplored, indicating potential novelty.\n\n## Relevant Techniques and Studies\n\n### Dynamic Convolutions\n- **Eagle and Finch: RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence**:\n  - This work introduces dynamic recurrence mechanisms that enhance the expressiveness of autoregressive units without significant computational costs**Internal Library Sources**.\n- **DSTAGNN: Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network**:\n  - Demonstrates the use of dynamic convolutions to capture a wide range of dynamic temporal dependencies via multi-scale gated convolution**External Sources**.\n\n### Multi-Scale Processing\n- **MICN: Multi-scale Local and Global Context Modeling**:\n  - Employs down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively, which is crucial for modeling complex dependencies in language data**External Sources**.\n- **What Makes Convolutional Models Great on Long Sequence Modeling?**:\n  - Provides principles for designing efficient convolutional kernels that scale sub-linearly with input length and possess a decaying structure to prioritize closer neighbors**External Sources**.\n\n### Hardware Optimizations\n- **FlashFFTConv** and **CacheOptRMSNorm**:\n  - These studies introduce techniques such as tiling and cache-aware normalization to optimize convolution operations for hardware efficiency, ensuring compatibility with hardware accelerators like tensor cores**External Sources**.\n- **Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Pixelwise Classification on Heterogeneous Hardware Systems**:\n  - Develops efficient CNN models with adaptive convolutions optimized for heterogeneous hardware, aligning with the need for hardware-efficient GAU implementations**External Sources**.\n\n## Implementation and Integration Insights\n\n### Dynamic Kernel Generation\n- Insights from **DSTAGNN** and **Unsupervised Optical Flow Estimation** highlight the need for balanced complexity to avoid substantial computational overhead.

While the Conv GAU in the seed design offers convolutional processing for local feature extraction, it has limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and adapting to varying input contexts. Additionally, computational efficiency and scalability are critical challenges when deploying large-scale LMs.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose **DynamicMultiScaleConvGAU**, an enhancement of the Conv GAU that integrates dynamic and multi-scale convolutional techniques. By employing input-dependent dynamic convolutions and multi-scale architectures, we aim to improve the expressiveness, adaptability, and efficiency of the Conv GAU. Hardware-optimized implementations ensure that these enhancements do not compromise computational efficiency, enabling the model to scale effectively.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Dynamic Convolutions\n\n- **Wu et al.
