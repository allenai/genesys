Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Karan Goel, Khaled Kamal Saab, Tri Dao, A.

We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/59 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nData Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pages 1-29, 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/ s10618-021-00745-9.

HiPPO The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory 24] and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) 58. The HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture. A successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT [12] keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations. First, the state matrix $A$ and discretization timescale $\\Delta t$ cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which $A$ matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations. Second, (1) is a 1-D to $N$-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D. This creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/59 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nApproximations of differential equations. Any differential equation $\\dot{x}(t)=f(t, x(t))$ has an equivalent integral equation $x(t)=x\\left(t_{0}\\right)+\\int_{t_{0}}^{t} f(s, x(s)) d s$. This can be numerically solved by storing some approximation for $x$, and keeping it fixed inside $f(t, x)$ while iterating the equation. For example, Picard iteration is often used to prove the existence of solutions to ODEs by iterating the equation $x_{i+1}(t):=x_{i}\\left(t_{0}\\right)+\\int_{t_{0}}^{t} f\\left(s, x_{i}(s)\\right) d s$ . In other words, it finds a sequence of functions $x_{0}(t), x_{1}(t), \\ldots$ that approximate the solution $x(t)$ of the integral equation. Discretization. On the other hand, for a desired sequence of discrete times $t_{i}$, approximations to $x\\left(t_{0}\\right), x\\left(t_{1}\\right), \\ldots$ can be found by iterating the equation $x\\left(t_{i+1}\\right)=x\\left(t_{i}\\right)+\\int_{t_{i}}^{t_{i+1}} f(s, x(s)) d s$. Different ways of approximating the RHS integral lead to different discretization schemes. We single out a discretization method called the generalized bilinear transform (GBT) which is specialized to linear ODEs of the form (1). Given a step size $\\Delta t$, the GBT update is\n\n$$\nx(t+\\Delta t)=(I-\\alpha \\Delta t \\cdot A)^{-1}(I+(1-\\alpha) \\Delta t \\cdot A) x(t)+\\Delta t(I-\\alpha \\Delta t \\cdot A)^{-1} B \\cdot u(t)\n$$\n\nThree important cases are: $\\alpha=0$ becomes the classic Euler method which is simply the first-order approximation $x(t+\\Delta t)=x(t)+\\Delta t \\cdot x^{\\prime}(t) ; \\alpha=1$ is called the backward Euler method; and $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$ is called the bilinear method, which preserves the stability of the system 61. In Section 3.2 we will show that the backward Euler method and Picard iteration are actually related to RNNs. On the other hand, the bilinear discretization will be our main method for computing accurate discrete-time approximations of our continuous-time models. In particular, define $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ to be the matrices appearing in $\\sqrt{3}$ for $\\alpha=\\frac{1}{2}$. Then the discrete-time state-space model is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{t} & =\\bar{A} x_{t-1}+\\bar{B} u_{t} \\\\\ny_{t} & =C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$\\Delta t$ as a timescale. In most models, the length of dependencies they can capture is roughly proportional to $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$. Thus we also refer to the step size $\\Delta t$ as a timescale. This is an intrinsic part of converting a continuous-time ODE into a discrete-time recurrence, and most ODE-based RNN models have it as an important and non-trainable hyperparameter [24, 47, 58]. On the other hand, in Section 3.2 we show that the gating mechanism of classical RNNs is a version of learning $\\Delta t$. Moreover when viewed as a CNN, the timescale $\\Delta t$ can be viewed as controlling the width of the convolution kernel (Section 3.2). Ideally, all ODE-based sequence models would be able to automatically learn the proper timescales. Continuous-time memory. Consider an input function $u(t)$, a fixed probability measure $\\omega(t)$, and a sequence of $N$ basis functions such as polynomials. At every time $t$, the history of $u$ before time $t$ can be projected onto this basis, which yields a vector of coefficients $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ that represents an optimal approximation of the history of $u$ with respect to the provided measure $\\omega$. The map taking the function $u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to coefficients $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is called the High-Order Polynomial Projection Operator (HiPPO) with respect to the measure $\\omega$.\n```\n\n#### 2. Liquid Structural State-Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Ramin M.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nW.

Score: 0.85)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/45 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\nHambly, B. and Lyons, T.

However, such techniques often rely on traditional discrete-time neural models and face difficulties in generalizing to domain shifts by failing to account for the causal relationships between the agent and the environment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and experimental framework for learning causal representations using continuous-time neural networks, specifically over their discrete-time counterparts. We evaluate our method in the context of visual-control learning of drones over a series of complex tasks, ranging from short- and long-term navigation, to chasing static and dynamic objects through photorealistic environments. Our results demonstrate that causal continuous-time deep models can perform robust navigation tasks, where advanced recurrent models fail.

Toward Equation of Motion for Deep Neural Networks: Continuous-time Gradient Descent and Discretization Error Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: continuous time neural networks*\n\n*Taiki Miyagawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** EoM highlights differences between continuous-time and discrete-time GD, indicating the importance of the counter term for a better description of the discrete learning dynamics of GD.\n\n**Abstract:** We derive and solve an ``Equation of Motion'' (EoM) for deep neural networks (DNNs), a differential equation that precisely describes the discrete learning dynamics of DNNs. Differential equations are continuous but have played a prominent role even in the study of discrete optimization (gradient descent (GD) algorithms). However, there still exist gaps between differential equations and the actual learning dynamics of DNNs due to discretization error. In this paper, we start from gradient flow (GF) and derive a counter term that cancels the discretization error between GF and GD. As a result, we obtain EoM, a continuous differential equation that precisely describes the discrete learning dynamics of GD. We also derive discretization error to show to what extent EoM is precise. In addition, we apply EoM to two specific cases: scale- and translation-invariant layers. EoM highlights differences between continuous-time and discrete-time GD, indicating the importance of the counter term for a better description of the discrete learning dynamics of GD.

Through the use of a specially chosen corrector step based on the underdamped Langevin diffusion, we obtain better dimension dependence than prior works on DDPM ($O(\\sqrt{d})$ vs. $O(d)$, assuming smoothness of the data distribution), highlighting potential advantages of the ODE framework.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4.

It is a matrix-gain algorithm designed so that its asymptotic variance is optimal. Moreover, an ODE analysis suggests that the transient behavior is a close match to a deterministic Newton-Raphson implementation. This is made possible by a two time-scale update equation for the matrix gain sequence. The analysis suggests that the approach will lead to stable and efficient computation even for non-ideal parameterized settings. Numerical experiments confirm the quick convergence, even in such non-ideal cases.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. ACMP: Allen-Cahn Message Passing with Attractive and Repulsive Forces for Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation*\n\n*Yuelin Wang, Kai Yi, Xinliang Liu, Yu Guang Wang, Shi Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** ACMP provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing and achieves state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data considering neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The dynamics of the system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles without blowing up. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the particle system solution constitutes the message passing propagation. ACMP which has a simple implementation with a neural ODE solver can propel the network depth up to one hundred of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs circumventing the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. GNNs with ACMP achieve state of the art performance for real-world node classification tasks on both homophilic and heterophilic datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Abdul Fatir Ansari, Alvin Heng, Andre Lim, Harold Soh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations and proposes three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Continuous and Discrete-Time Survival Prediction with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous time neural networks*\n\n*\u00d8rnulf Borgan, H\u00e5vard Kvamme*\n\n**Abstract:** Application of discrete-time survival methods for continuous-time survival prediction is considered. For this purpose, a scheme for discretization of continuous-time data is proposed by considering the quantiles of the estimated event-time distribution, and, for smaller data sets, it is found to be preferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two interpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both of which are shown to yield improved performance compared to the discrete-time estimates. The survival methods considered are based on the likelihood for right-censored survival data, and parameterize either the probability mass function (PMF) or the discrete-time hazard rate, both with neural networks. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the hazard rate parametrization is found to perform slightly better than the parametrization of the PMF. Inspired by these investigations, a continuous-time method is proposed by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous time neural networks*\n\n*Ivana Kaji\u0107, Chris Eliasmith, Aaron Voelker*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\\mathcal{O}( d / \\sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Dynamic Graph Neural ODEs\n\n*From Search Query: neural ODE implementation*\n\n*Shirui Pan, Bin Yang, Siheng Chen, Yuan-Fang Li, Yu Zheng, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate time series forecasting has long received significant attention in real-world applications, such as energy consumption and traffic prediction. While recent methods demonstrate good forecasting abilities, they have three fundamental limitations. (i) Discrete neural architectures: Interlacing individually parameterized spatial and temporal blocks to encode rich underlying patterns leads to discontinuous latent state trajectories and higher forecasting numerical errors. (ii) High complexity: Discrete approaches complicate models with dedicated designs and redundant parameters, leading to higher computational and memory overheads. (iii) Reliance on graph priors: Relying on predefined static graph structures limits their effectiveness and practicability in real-world applications. In this paper, we address all the above limitations by proposing a continuous model to forecast $\\textbf{M}$ultivariate $\\textbf{T}$ime series with dynamic $\\textbf{G}$raph neural $\\textbf{O}$rdinary $\\textbf{D}$ifferential $\\textbf{E}$quations ($\\texttt{MTGODE}$). Specifically, we first abstract multivariate time series into dynamic graphs with time-evolving node features and unknown graph structures. Then, we design and solve a neural ODE to complement missing graph topologies and unify both spatial and temporal message passing, allowing deeper graph propagation and fine-grained temporal information aggregation to characterize stable and precise latent spatial-temporal dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate the superiorities of $\\texttt{MTGODE}$ from various perspectives on five time series benchmark datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design using continuous-time neural networks, neural ODE implementations, and efficient state space models, here are some key findings and references that align with their goals:\n\n## Practical Implementations of Continuous-Time Neural Networks in Language Models\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly discuss continuous-time neural networks in the context of language models, we can infer from related fields:\n\n- Continuous-Time Recurrent Neural Networks (CTRNNs) are analyzed using dynamical systems theory, which could be adapted for language models.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 62/71 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nu1 = np.random.uniform(size = (N,))\n    u2 = np.random.uniform(size = (N,))\n    nu_log = np.log(-0.5*np.log(u1*(r_max**2-r_min***2) + r_min**2))\n    theta_log = np.log(max_phase*u2)\n    # Glorot initialized Input/Output projection matrices\n    B_re = np.random.normal(size=(N,H))/np.sqrt(2*H)\n    B_im = np.random.normal(size=(N,H))/np.sqrt(2*H)\n    C_re = np.random.normal(size=(H,N))/np.sqrt(N)\n    C_im = np.random.normal(size=(H,N))/np.sqrt(N)\n    D = np.random.normal(size = (H,))\n    # Normalization factor\n    diag_lambda = np.exp(-np.exp(nu_log) + 1j*np.exp(theta_log))\n    gamma_log = np.log(np.sqrt(1-np.abs(diag_lambda)**2))\n    return nu_log, theta_log, B_re, B_im, C_re, C_im, D, gamma_log\ndef binary_operator_diag(element_i, element_j):\n    # Binary operator for parallel scan of linear recurrence. a_i, bu_i = element_i\n    a_j, bu_j = element_j\n    return a_j * a_i, a_j * bu_i + bu_j\n```\n\n\n## B. Related works\n\nWe first discuss standard RNN-based approaches for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and then provide a historical overview on the progress of the literature stemming from the S4 paper (Gu et al., 2021a). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Before the rise of transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs were widely used in various applications of natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Mikolov et al., 2010), machine translation (Cho et al., 2014b) and text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016). The modern RNN structure (see Eq.1) is mainly attributed to the works of Rumelhart et al. (1985). However, it is possible to see the Hopfield Networks as a particular form of RNN (Hopfield, 1982). Modern RNN formulations are also often related to the Elman Networks (Elman, 1990). The issue of vanishing or exploding gradients, as described by Bengio et al. (1994); Pascanu et al. (2013), is one barrier to training Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with gradient descent. This problem limits the ability of RNNs to learn, especially on tasks with long input sequences. One of the critical contributions to the success of RNNs was the introduction of gating mechanisms such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) proposed by the Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997). LSTMs address the vanishing gradients problem by introducing input, output, and forget gates, which enable the network to selectively remember or forget information from previous time steps. Another popular variant of gated RNNs is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014b) which simplifies the LSTM architecture by merging input and forget gates into a single update gate. Mitigating the vanishing gradient problem with orthogonal and unitary RNNs. Recently, Arjovsky et al. (2016) introduced unitary evolution RNNs (uRNN), where eigenvalues in the RNN transition matrix (see Eq. (1)) are restricted to live on the unit circle. The induced map driving the hidden state evolution, therefore, mixes state components taking into account new inputs - but the signal from past timestamps is not exponentially vanishing/exploding as in the vanilla RNN case (see discussion on stability in \u00a73.2.1). This idea is powerful but introduces two problems: (1) choosing unitary transitions restricts the function approximation class, and (2) training unitary matrices is expensive since a projection on the Stiefel manifold is required at each gradient step. To resolve the second issue, many works devoted attention to carefully designed reparameterization of the transition matrix as e.g., with the product of simpler matrices (Arjovsky et al., 2016), Givens rotations (Jing et al., 2017), Householder reflections (Mhammedi et al., 2017), or as exponentials of skew-symmetric matrices (Hyland and R\u00e4tsch, 2017; Lezcano-Casado and Mart\u0131nez-Rubio, 2019). The approximation capacity of these models is discussed and improved in (Wisdom et al., 2016). A further step in designing efficient orthogonal RNNs is provided by Helfrich et al. (2018), who parametrized skew-symmetric matrix using the Cayley transforms, resulting in a fully real parameter space. Other works which proposed conceptually different solutions to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem include combinations with rectified linear units (Le et al., 2015), Lipschitz RNNs (Erichson et al., 2021), and approaches based on dilated convolutions to increase context size (Bai et al., 2018; Oord et al., 2016)\n\nDeep state-space models (SSMs), a historical overview. Inspired by interesting approaches involving continuous-time representation for recurrent neural networks (Voelker et al., 2019), Gu et al. (2020) recently provided an alternative view on the vanishing gradient problem: one can design linear continuous-time statespace models (SSMs), of the form $\\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t)$ where the state $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is guaranteed to compress all relevant (under a certain metric) information about previously observed (one-dimensional) inputs $u([0, t])$. For instance, by using specific pair of matrices $\\left(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}\\right)$, one can discretize the continuous-time SSM above using a stable, accurate integrator (e.g., bilinear or zero-order-hold) and retrieve the hidden state $x(t)$, which contains the coefficients for the best $N$-th degree polynomial approximation to $u([0, t])$. The idea of Gu et al. (2020) was to then use the resulting discretized structured (i.e., using structured HiPPO matrices) state-space model as a starting for the design and initialization of a novel gated RNN. Later, Gu et al. (2021a) scaled up this idea into a deep architecture, where a collection (one for each input dimension) of discretized continuous-time structured SSM was placed at each layer as a substitute ${ }^{14}$ for the attention block, in an attempt to mitigate the $O\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ issue in transformers and provide a theoretically principled component for sequence-to-sequence modeling. The model reached state-of-the-art on the Long Range Arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), effectively showcasing the power of discretized linear recurrences using structured\n\n[^9]transition matrices. Notably, the resulting model, named S4, uses a convenient and stable representation of the HiPPO transition, which is initialized using a normal + low-rank matrix and then learned efficiently in diagonal + low-rank form using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) and Cauchy kernels. In the months following the publication of S4, Gupta et al. (2022a) noticed that most of S4 performance can be retrieved by only considering the diagonal component of the HiPPO matrix, and therefore showed the power of discretized diagonal structured continuous-time state space models. This architecture is known as DSS. As the interest of the community was rising, with first applications of DSS and S4 in language (Mehta et al., 2022), vision (Nguyen et al., 2022) and audio (Goel et al., 2022), Gu et al. (2022a) further simplified DSS providing a diagonal form (S4D) with theoretical guarantees in the infinite width setting. Notably Gu et al. (2022a) showed that, to retrieve most performance of S4, one can simply initialize the transition matrix $A$ in diagonal form, with entries $a_{n}=-\\frac{1}{2}+i \\pi n$ (S4D-Lin) or $a_{n}=-\\frac{1}{2}+i \\frac{N}{\\pi}\\left(\\frac{N}{n+1}-1\\right)$ (S4D-Inv). Our interest in S4-like models spiked at this point since the findings of Gu et al. (2022a) suggest that, given the effectiveness of such simplified versions of $A$, the root of $S 4$ success might be attributable to more fundamental effects are orthogonal to the HiPPO theory. Shortly after, Smith et al. (2022) found that one can also depart from the formal one-dimensional discretization structure of S4, rooted in the HiPPO theory, and considered a simplified version where all input dimensions are efficiently and simultaneously processed using parallel scans (Martin and Cundy, 2017) \u2014 not separately like in S4, S4D, and DSS. This model (named S5) set a new state-of-the art on PathX, the hardest task in the Long Range Arena, and provides further evidence for a conceptually simpler motivation for the performance of deep state-space models. Indeed, as already mentioned, 55 is not precisely the discretization of a latent continuoustime SSM, yet still includes parameters like discretization stepsizes that have an ambiguous interpretation in this context ${ }^{15}$, suggesting further investigations are needed. At the same time, a few interesting works developed novel variants of the S4 architecture. Liquid S4 used the original (non-diagonal) S4 formulation combined with liquid time-constant networks (Hasani et al., 2021, 2022). Similar to DSS, S4D, and S5, Mega also simplified S4 to a diagonal SSM (Ma et al., 2022) while showing additionally that restricting the diagonal $A$ to real numbers - giving it an exponential moving average (EMA) interpretation - can still work well when combined with attention and a gated block design. Another intriguing view was provided by the SGConv model (Li et al., 2022a), which leverages the convolutional interpretation of SSMs (Gu et al., 2021b) to design a purely filter-based version of S4, with no latent continuous-time model or need for discretization. The discretization viewpoint also attracted the interest of Gupta et al. (2022b), concurrent to this work, who pointed out that, after numerical integration, diagonal state-space models and linear RNNs share the same function approximation class. Gupta et al. (2022b) then introduced DLR, most closely related to DSS and S4D (each input is processed independently at each layer) but where the discretization stepsize $\\Delta$ is absorbed into the continuous-time transition matrix A (see \u00a72). Their focus was on a new set of synthetic long-range tasks with strong supervision (e.g. segmentation), while ours is on the established Long Range Arena benchmark. To conclude, we point the reader to interesting recent applications of models inspired by the S4 architecture. In addition to earlier applications in NLP (Mehta et al., 2022), more sophisticated architectures based on S4 recently showed great promise in language modeling (Dao et al., 2022b; Ma et al., 2022). Specifically, Dao et al. (2022b) designed a new generative language model, H3, that outperforms GPT-Neo-2.7B with SSMs, augmented with two attention layers. Besides language, deep state-space models were also found successful for long video/audio understanding and generation tasks (Goel et al., 2022; Islam and Bertasius, 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022), and have attracted interest in biology (Bordin et al., 2022) and time series forecasting (Zhou et al., 2022).\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nW.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5. There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited resolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical constraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online 3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation \u2013\u2013 packing con\ufb01guration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-\ufb02edged description of the state and action space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is proportional to the number of leaf nodes, i.e. candidate placements, making the DRL model easy to train and well-performing even with continuous solution space. During training, PCT expands based on heuristic rules, however, the DRL model learns a much more effective and robust packing policy than heuristic methods. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms all existing online BPP methods and is versatile in terms of incorporating various practical constraints.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4.

However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7.

The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model, which was then out-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper, we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First, we identify several key modeling and training techniques, and apply them to the RNN architecture, yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT\u201914 English to French and English to German tasks. Second, we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements, outperforming the RNMT+ model on both benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 443  (*Influential: 27*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\n*From Search Query: continuous time state space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Tri Dao, Khaled Saab, Karan Goel, Isys Johnson, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Conference:** combining-recurrent-convolutional-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: continuous time state space models*\n\n*Harold Soh, Andre Lim, Alvin Heng, Abdul Fatir Ansari*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-26\n\n\n\n#### 3.

BossNAS: Exploring Hybrid CNN-transformers with Block-wisely Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid neural architectures*\n\n*Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang, Bing Wang, Jiefeng Peng, Guangrun Wang, Tao Tang, Changlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** A myriad of recent breakthroughs in hand-crafted neural architectures for visual recognition have highlighted the urgent need to explore hybrid architectures consisting of diversified building blocks. Meanwhile, neural architecture search methods are surging with an expectation to reduce human efforts. However, whether NAS methods can efficiently and effectively handle diversified search spaces with disparate candidates (e.g. CNNs and transformers) is still an open question. In this work, we present Block-wisely Self-supervised Neural Architecture Search (BossNAS), an unsupervised NAS method that addresses the problem of inaccurate architecture rating caused by large weight-sharing space and biased supervision in previous methods. More specifically, we factorize the search space into blocks and utilize a novel self-supervised training scheme, named ensemble bootstrapping, to train each block separately before searching them as a whole towards the population center. Additionally, we present HyTra search space, a fabric-like hybrid CNN-transformer search space with searchable down-sampling positions. On this challenging search space, our searched model, BossNet-T, achieves up to 82.5% accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing EfficientNet by 2.4% with comparable compute time. Moreover, our method achieves superior architecture rating accuracy with 0.78 and 0.76 Spearman correlation on the canonical MBConv search space with ImageNet and on NATS-Bench size search space with CIFAR-100, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art NAS methods.

NASA: Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration for Hardware Inspired Hybrid Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid neural architectures*\n\n*Yingyan Lin, Zhongfeng Wang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Huihong Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Multiplication is arguably the most cost-dominant operation in modern deep neural networks (DNNs), limiting their achievable efficiency and thus more extensive deployment in resource-constrained applications. To tackle this limitation, pioneering works have developed handcrafted multiplication-free DNNs, which require expert knowledge and time-consuming manual iteration, calling for fast development tools. To this end, we propose a Neural Architecture Search and Acceleration framework dubbed NASA, which enables automated multiplication-reduced DNN development and integrates a dedicated multiplication-reduced accelerator for boosting DNNs' achievable efficiency. Specifically, NASA adopts neural architecture search (NAS) spaces that augment the state-of-the-art one with hardware-inspired multiplication-free operators, such as shift and adder, armed with a novel progressive pretrain strategy (PGP) together with customized training recipes to automatically search for optimal multiplication-reduced DNNs; On top of that, NASA further develops a dedicated accelerator, which advocates a chunk-based template and auto-mapper dedicated for NASA-NAS resulting DNNs to better leverage their algorithmic properties for boosting hardware efficiency. Experimental results and ablation studies consistently validate the advantages of NASA's algorithm-hardware co-design framework in terms of achievable accuracy and efficiency tradeoffs.

These models, such as Liquid Structural State-Space Models, are designed to learn and adapt to incoming inputs at inference, offering potential for better handling of long-term dependencies and stability.\n\n- The \"Mamba Neural Operator\" (MNO) framework integrates structured state-space models into neural operators, which is particularly relevant for modeling continuous dynamics and long-range dependencies. This approach extends the theoretical foundations of state-space models to neural operators, making it adaptable to diverse architectures, including those based on Transformers.\n\n## Efficient Discretization Methods that Preserve Stability\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model via Fast Tensor Convolution and Block Diagonalization\" (eSSM) proposes a method for discretizing continuous-time state space models efficiently. This approach uses convolutional representations, diagonalization, and fast tensor convolution to reduce parameter size and improve training speed while maintaining stability. The discretized SSMs are formulated to preserve the stability and efficiency of the continuous-time models.\n\n- The \"Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models\" work by Gu et al. discusses the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), which simulates a linear continuous-time state-space representation. This method ensures that the discretization process maintains the theoretical properties of the continuous-time model, such as stability and the ability to handle long-term dependencies (as referenced in the analysis note).\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining Discrete and Continuous Updates\n\n- The concept of hybrid architectures is explored in the context of \"Liquid Neural Networks,\" where continuous-time models are integrated with discrete updates. These models leverage the strengths of both continuous-time dynamics and discrete neural networks, offering a balance between efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- The \"State Space Models for Machine Learning\" paper discusses how state space models can be combined with other architectures, such as graph neural networks, to create hybrid models. This approach can model temporal dynamics using a state space formulation, which can be integrated with discrete updates to enhance the model's capabilities.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations for Long Sequence Processing\n\n- The \"Efficient State Space Model via Fast Tensor Convolution and Block Diagonalization\" (eSSM) is designed to be memory-efficient for long sequence modeling. It uses fewer parameters than traditional discrete neural networks and employs strategies like diagonalization and fast tensor convolution to reduce computational overhead.\n\n- The \"Mamba Neural Operator\" framework also addresses memory efficiency by leveraging the structured state-space design, which reduces memory consumption compared to Transformers. This makes it more suitable for handling long sequences and continuous data efficiently.\n\nThese findings and references provide a solid foundation for improving autoregressive language model design by incorporating continuous-time state space models, efficient discretization methods, and hybrid neural architectures, all while ensuring memory efficiency and stability.\n",

HiPPO The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory 24] and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) 58. The HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture. A successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT [12] keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations. First, the state matrix $A$ and discretization timescale $\\Delta t$ cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which $A$ matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations. Second, (1) is a 1-D to $N$-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D. This creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3. There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form. At last, we highlight future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/22 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nForgione, M. and Piga, D.

Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

To avoid time-discretization approximation of the underlying process, we propose a continuous-time MBRL framework based on a novel actor-critic method. Our approach also infers the unknown state evolution differentials with Bayesian neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) to account for epistemic uncertainty. We implement and test our method on a new ODE-RL suite that explicitly solves continuous-time control systems. Our experiments illustrate that the model is robust against irregular and noisy data, is sample-efficient, and can solve control problems which pose challenges to discrete-time MBRL methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. Direct Embedding of Temporal Network Edges via Time-Decayed Line Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient continuous time discretization*\n\n*Sudhanshu Chanpuriya, Ryan A.

Existing methods for machine learning on temporal networks generally exhibit at least one of two limitations. First, time is assumed to be discretized, so if the time data is continuous, the user must determine the discretization and discard precise time information. Second, edge representations can only be calculated indirectly from the nodes, which may be suboptimal for tasks like edge classification. We present a simple method that avoids both shortcomings: construct the line graph of the network, which includes a node for each interaction, and weigh the edges of this graph based on the difference in time between interactions. From this derived graph, edge representations for the original network can be computed with efficient classical methods. The simplicity of this approach facilitates explicit theoretical analysis: we can constructively show the effectiveness of our method's representations for a natural synthetic model of temporal networks. Empirical results on real-world networks demonstrate our method's efficacy and efficiency on both edge classification and temporal link prediction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. The Pairwise Piecewise-Linear Embedding for Efficient Non-Linear Classification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient continuous time discretization*\n\n*Ofir Pele, B. Taskar, A. Globerson, M. Werman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a non-linear feature map that is both very efficient, but at the same time highly expressive, and consistently outperforms other methods, including a wide range of kernels.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear classifiers are much faster to learn and test than non-linear ones. On the other hand, non-linear kernels offer improved performance, albeit at the increased cost of training kernel classifiers. To use non-linear mappings with efficient linear learning algorithms, explicit embeddings that approximate popular kernels have recently been proposed. However, the embedding process is often costly and the results are usually less accurate than kernel methods. In this work we propose a non-linear feature map that is both very efficient, but at the same time highly expressive. The method is based on discretization and interpolation of individual features values and feature pairs. The discretization allows us to model different regions of the feature space separately, while the interpolation preserves the original continuous values. Using this embedding is strictly more general than a linear model and as efficient as the second-order polynomial explicit feature map. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that our method consistently outperforms other methods, including a wide range of kernels. This is in contrast to other proposed embeddings that were faster than kernel methods, but with lower accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 268  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5.

This paper introduces the HEAT model, a new post-hoc OOD detection method estimating the density of in-distribution (ID) samples using hybrid energy-based models (EBM) in the feature space of a pre-trained backbone. HEAT complements prior density estimators of the ID density, e.g. parametric models like the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), to provide an accurate yet robust density estimation. A second contribution is to leverage the EBM framework to provide a unified density estimation and to compose several energy terms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significance of the two contributions.

Tantipongpipat*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an algorithmic solution which works for any network in a black-box manner and trains a Recurrent Neural Network to achieve good privacy-vs-accuracy tradeoff, while being significantly faster than DP-SGD and with a similar memory footprint as non-private SGD.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially Private-SGD (DP-SGD) of Abadi et al. (2016) and its variations are the only known algorithms for private training of large scale neural networks. This algorithm requires computation of per-sample gradients norms which is extremely slow and memory intensive in practice. In this paper, we present a new framework to design differentially private optimizers called DP-SGD-JL and DP-Adam-JL. Our approach uses Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) projections to quickly approximate the per-sample gradient norms without exactly computing them, thus making the training time and memory requirements of our optimizers closer to that of their non-DP versions. Unlike previous attempts to make DP-SGD faster which work only on a subset of network architectures or use compiler techniques, we propose an algorithmic solution which works for any network in a black-box manner which is the main contribution of this paper. To illustrate this, on IMDb dataset, we train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to achieve good privacy-vs-accuracy tradeoff, while being significantly faster than DP-SGD and with a similar memory footprint as non-private SGD. The privacy analysis of our algorithms is more involved than DP-SGD, we use the recently proposed f-DP framework of Dong et al.

GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient architectures*\n\n*Jiawei Zhao, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Zhangyang Wang, A. Anandkumar, Yuandong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes GaLore, a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA, and demonstrates the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 84  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

Analog Bits: Generating Discrete Data using Diffusion Models with Self-Conditioning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient continuous time discretization*\n\n*Geoffrey Hinton, Ruixiang Zhang, Ting Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Bit Diffusion: a simple and generic approach for generating discrete data with continuous state and continuous time diffusion models. The main idea behind our approach is to first represent the discrete data as binary bits, and then train a continuous diffusion model to model these bits as real numbers which we call analog bits. To generate samples, the model first generates the analog bits, which are then thresholded to obtain the bits that represent the discrete variables. We further propose two simple techniques, namely Self-Conditioning and Asymmetric Time Intervals, which lead to a significant improvement in sample quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed approach can achieve strong performance in both discrete image generation and image captioning tasks. For discrete image generation, we significantly improve previous state-of-the-art on both CIFAR-10 (which has 3K discrete 8-bit tokens) and ImageNet-64x64 (which has 12K discrete 8-bit tokens), outperforming the best autoregressive model in both sample quality (measured by FID) and efficiency. For image captioning on MS-COCO dataset, our approach achieves competitive results compared to autoregressive models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-08\n\n\n\n#### 2.

A ConvNet for the 2020s\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state space models*\n\n*Saining Xie, Trevor Darrell, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Chao-yuan Wu, Hanzi Mao, Zhuang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"Roaring 20s\" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually \"modernize\" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-10\n\n\n\n#### 4. PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient architectures*\n\n*Guo-Jun Qi, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian, Hongkai Xiong, Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xin Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-network and searching for an optimal architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely, Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-network to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We alleviate it using edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoys both faster speed and higher training stability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 with merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) using 3.8 GPU-days for search.

Edge-MoE: Memory-Efficient Multi-Task Vision Transformer Architecture with Task-level Sparsity via Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient architectures*\n\n*Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang, Zhiwen Fan, Hanxue Liang, Rishov Sarkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Computer vision researchers are embracing two promising paradigms: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-task Learning (MTL), which both show great performance but are computation-intensive, given the quadratic complexity of self-attention in ViT and the need to activate an entire large MTL model for one task. M$^3$ViT is the latest multi-task ViT model that introduces mixture-of-experts (MoE), where only a small portion of subnetworks (\"experts\") are sparsely and dynamically activated based on the current task. M$^3$ViT achieves better accuracy and over 80% computation reduction but leaves challenges for efficient deployment on FPGA. Our work, dubbed Edge-MoE, solves the challenges to introduce the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for multi-task ViT with a collection of architectural innovations, including (1) a novel reordering mechanism for self-attention, which requires only constant bandwidth regardless of the target parallelism; (2) a fast single-pass softmax approximation; (3) an accurate and low-cost GELU approximation; (4) a unified and flexible computing unit that is shared by almost all computational layers to maximally reduce resource usage; and (5) uniquely for M$^3$ViT, a novel patch reordering method to eliminate memory access overhead. Edge-MoE achieves 2.24x and 4.90x better energy efficiency comparing with GPU and CPU, respectively. A real-time video demonstration is available online, along with our open-source code written using High-Level Synthesis.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient continuous-time discretization, hybrid state space models, memory-efficient architectures, and stability analysis, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Efficient Discretization Methods for Continuous-Time State Space Models\n\n- The paper on \"Pathwise uniform convergence of time discretization schemes for semilinear stochastic evolution equations\" discusses convergence rates for time discretization schemes, which is crucial for maintaining stability and accuracy when discretizing continuous-time models.\n- The \"Continuous Time Dynamic Structural Equation Models\" by Asparouhov and Muth\u00e9n describe an algorithm for approximating continuous times of observations with a discrete time frame, which can be adapted for efficient discretization in state space models.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.) This paper fleshes out the relationship between state space models and attention through the bridge of structured matrices.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: continuous discrete neural networks, sparse state space computation, hardware efficient matrix operations\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Re-Think and Re-Design Graph Neural Networks in Spaces of Continuous Graph Diffusion Functionals\n\n*From Search Query: continuous discrete neural networks*\n\n*Tingting Dan, Jiaqi Ding, Ziquan Wei, S. Kovalsky, Minjeong Kim, Won Hwa Kim, Guorong Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed that predicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation to mitigate vanishing flows, and the objective function is customized to minimize transportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in domains like social networks and biological systems. However, the locality assumption of GNNs, which limits information exchange to neighboring nodes, hampers their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global patterns in graphs. To address this, we propose a new inductive bias based on variational analysis, drawing inspiration from the Brachistochrone problem. Our framework establishes a mapping between discrete GNN models and continuous diffusion functionals. This enables the design of application-specific objective functions in the continuous domain and the construction of discrete deep models with mathematical guarantees. To tackle over-smoothing in GNNs, we analyze the existing layer-by-layer graph embedding models and identify that they are equivalent to l2-norm integral functionals of graph gradients, which cause over-smoothing. Similar to edge-preserving filters in image denoising, we introduce total variation (TV) to align the graph diffusion pattern with global community topologies. Additionally, we devise a selective mechanism to address the trade-off between model depth and over-smoothing, which can be easily integrated into existing GNNs. Furthermore, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that predicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation. To mitigate vanishing flows, we customize the objective function to minimize transportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows. Our GNN models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on popular graph learning benchmarks such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Continuous vs. Discrete Optimization of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous discrete neural networks*\n\n*Omer Elkabetz, Nadav Cohen*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is hypothesized that the theory of gradient flows will unravel mysteries behind deep learning, and it is shown that over deep neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient flow trajectories enjoy favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing analyses of optimization in deep learning are either continuous, focusing on (variants of) gradient flow, or discrete, directly treating (variants of) gradient descent. Gradient flow is amenable to theoretical analysis, but is stylized and disregards computational efficiency. The extent to which it represents gradient descent is an open question in the theory of deep learning. The current paper studies this question. Viewing gradient descent as an approximate numerical solution to the initial value problem of gradient flow, we find that the degree of approximation depends on the curvature around the gradient flow trajectory. We then show that over deep neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient flow trajectories enjoy favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent. This finding allows us to translate an analysis of gradient flow over deep linear neural networks into a guarantee that gradient descent efficiently converges to global minimum almost surely under random initialization. Experiments suggest that over simple deep neural networks, gradient descent with conventional step size is indeed close to gradient flow. We hypothesize that the theory of gradient flows will unravel mysteries behind deep learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse state space computation*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse state space computation*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Sparse Probabilistic Circuits via Pruning and Growing\n\n*From Search Query: sparse state space computation*\n\n*Meihua Dang, Anji Liu, Guy Van den Broeck*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two operations: pruning and growing, that exploit the sparsity of PC structures and increase the capacity that is meaningfully used, allowing us to significantly scale up PC learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a tractable representation of probability distributions allowing for exact and efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. There has been significant recent progress on improving the scale and expressiveness of PCs. However, PC training performance plateaus as model size increases. We discover that most capacity in existing large PC structures is wasted: fully-connected parameter layers are only sparsely used. We propose two operations: pruning and growing, that exploit the sparsity of PC structures. Specifically, the pruning operation removes unimportant sub-networks of the PC for model compression and comes with theoretical guarantees. The growing operation increases model capacity by increasing the size of the latent space. By alternatingly applying pruning and growing, we increase the capacity that is meaningfully used, allowing us to significantly scale up PC learning. Empirically, our learner achieves state-of-the-art likelihoods on MNIST-family image datasets and on Penn Tree Bank language data compared to other PC learners and less tractable deep generative models such as flow-based models and variational autoencoders (VAEs).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. Vector-Vector-Matrix Architecture: A Novel Hardware-Aware Framework for Low-Latency Inference in NLP Applications\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations*\n\n*Matthew Khoury, Rumen Dangovski, L. Ou, Preslav Nakov, Yichen Shen, L. Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA) is proposed, which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT and reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become the standard approach to building reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, ranging from Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to dialogue systems. However, improving accuracy by increasing the model size requires a large number of hardware computations, which can slow down NLP applications significantly at inference time. To address this issue, we propose a novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA), which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT. This architecture takes advantage of specialized hardware that has low-latency vector-vector operations and higher-latency vector-matrix operations. It also reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy. We present empirical results suggesting that our framework can reduce the latency of sequence-to-sequence and Transformer models used for NMT by a factor of four. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that our VVMA extends to other domains, and we discuss novel hardware for its efficient use.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Continuous and Discrete-Time Survival Prediction with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous discrete neural networks*\n\n*\u00d8rnulf Borgan, H\u00e5vard Kvamme*\n\n**Abstract:** Application of discrete-time survival methods for continuous-time survival prediction is considered. For this purpose, a scheme for discretization of continuous-time data is proposed by considering the quantiles of the estimated event-time distribution, and, for smaller data sets, it is found to be preferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two interpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both of which are shown to yield improved performance compared to the discrete-time estimates. The survival methods considered are based on the likelihood for right-censored survival data, and parameterize either the probability mass function (PMF) or the discrete-time hazard rate, both with neural networks. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the hazard rate parametrization is found to perform slightly better than the parametrization of the PMF. Inspired by these investigations, a continuous-time method is proposed by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. MASA-TCN: Multi-anchor Space-aware Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks for Continuous and Discrete EEG Emotion Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: continuous discrete neural networks*\n\n*Cuntai Guan, Chuangao Tang, Su Zhang, Yi Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** Emotion recognition using electroencephalogram (EEG) mainly has two scenarios: classification of the discrete labels and regression of the continuously tagged labels. Although many algorithms were proposed for classification tasks, there are only a few methods for regression tasks. For emotion regression, the label is continuous in time. A natural method is to learn the temporal dynamic patterns. In previous studies, long short-term memory (LSTM) and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN) were utilized to learn the temporal contextual information from feature vectors of EEG. However, the spatial patterns of EEG were not effectively extracted. To enable the spatial learning ability of TCN towards better regression and classification performances, we propose a novel unified model, named MASA-TCN, for EEG emotion regression and classification tasks. The space-aware temporal layer enables TCN to additionally learn from spatial relations among EEG electrodes. Besides, a novel multi-anchor block with attentive fusion is proposed to learn dynamic temporal dependencies. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show MASA-TCN achieves higher results than the state-of-the-art methods for both EEG emotion regression and classification tasks.

TorchSparse++: Efficient Training and Inference Framework for Sparse Convolution on GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: sparse state space computation*\n\n*Song Han, Yu Wang, Guohao Dai, Xiuyu Li, Zhongming Yu, Ke Hong, Zhijian Liu, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse convolution plays a pivotal role in emerging workloads, including point cloud processing in AR/VR, autonomous driving, and graph understanding in recommendation systems. Since the computation pattern is sparse and irregular, specialized high-performance kernels are required. Existing GPU libraries offer two dataflow types for sparse convolution. The gather-GEMM-scatter dataflow is easy to implement but not optimal in performance, while the dataflows with overlapped computation and memory access (e.g.implicit GEMM) are highly performant but have very high engineering costs. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse++, a new GPU library that achieves the best of both worlds. We create a highly efficient Sparse Kernel Generator that generates performant sparse convolution kernels at less than one-tenth of the engineering cost of the current state-of-the-art system. On top of this, we design the Sparse Autotuner, which extends the design space of existing sparse convolution libraries and searches for the best dataflow configurations for training and inference workloads. Consequently, TorchSparse++ achieves 2.9x, 3.3x, 2.2x and 1.7x measured end-to-end speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU over state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine, SpConv 1.2, TorchSparse and SpConv v2 in inference; and is 1.2-1.3x faster than SpConv v2 in mixed precision training across seven representative autonomous driving benchmarks. It also seamlessly supports graph convolutions, achieving 2.6-7.6x faster inference speed compared with state-of-the-art graph deep learning libraries.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. 3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering\n\n*From Search Query: sparse state space computation*\n\n*George Drettakis, Thomas Leimk\u00fchler, Georgios Kopanas, Bernhard Kerbl*\n\n**Abstract:** Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (>= 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. SMASH: Co-designing Software Compression and Hardware-Accelerated Indexing for Efficient Sparse Matrix Operations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Important workloads, such as machine learning and graph analytics\napplications, heavily involve sparse linear algebra operations. These\noperations use sparse matrix compression as an effective means to avoid storing\nzeros and performing unnecessary computation on zero elements. However,\ncompression techniques like Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) that are widely used\ntoday introduce significant instruction overhead and expensive pointer-chasing\noperations to discover the positions of the non-zero elements. In this paper,\nwe identify the discovery of the positions (i.e., indexing) of non-zero\nelements as a key bottleneck in sparse matrix-based workloads, which greatly\nreduces the benefits of compression. We propose SMASH, a hardware-software\ncooperative mechanism that enables highly-efficient indexing and storage of\nsparse matrices. The key idea of SMASH is to explicitly enable the hardware to\nrecognize and exploit sparsity in data. To this end, we devise a novel software\nencoding based on a hierarchy of bitmaps. This encoding can be used to\nefficiently compress any sparse matrix, regardless of the extent and structure\nof sparsity. At the same time, the bitmap encoding can be directly interpreted\nby the hardware. We design a lightweight hardware unit, the Bitmap Management\nUnit (BMU), that buffers and scans the bitmap hierarchy to perform\nhighly-efficient indexing of sparse matrices. SMASH exposes an expressive and\nrich ISA to communicate with the BMU, which enables its use in accelerating any\nsparse matrix computation. We demonstrate the benefits of SMASH on four use\ncases that include sparse matrix kernels and graph analytics applications.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient matrix operations*\n\n*Jason K. Eshraghian, Peng Zhou, Dustin Richmond, Yiqiao Wang, Tyler Sheaves, Ethan Sifferman, Yu Zhang, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient continuous-discrete conversion, sparse state space computation, hardware-efficient matrix operations, and hybrid attention-SSM architectures, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Methods for Efficient Continuous-Discrete Conversion in Neural Networks\n\n- The work on \"Continuous-Time Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\" by Y\u0131ld\u0131z et al. (2021) provides insights into continuous-time modeling using Bayesian neural ordinary differential equations. This approach avoids the time-discretization approximation, which can be crucial for maintaining stability and handling variable-length dependencies in autoregressive models.\n\n- For practical implementation, careful discretization methods are necessary. Techniques such as those used in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) could be adapted, where continuous-time models are discretized using methods like the Runge-Kutta time-stepping approaches to maintain accuracy and efficiency.\n\n## Sparse Computation Techniques for State Space Models\n\n- The \"Variational Gaussian Process State-Space Models\" by Frigola et al. (2014) demonstrate the use of sparse Gaussian processes for efficient variational Bayesian learning of nonlinear state-space models. This approach allows for a trade-off between model capacity and computational cost, which is essential for memory efficiency.\n\n- The concept of structured sparsity, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be applied to reduce memory requirements and improve hardware utilization. This involves selective computation based on input relevance and leveraging sparse approximations to maintain model expressivity while reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Matrix Operation Patterns\n\n- The use of domain decomposition and parallelized computing, as discussed in the context of parareal physics-informed neural networks (PPINNs), can be beneficial for hardware-efficient matrix operations. This approach involves dividing the domain into sub-domains and solving the problem in parallel, which can significantly reduce training time and improve computational efficiency.\n\n- Implementing matrix operations with residual connections and multiplicative interactions, inspired by neural attention processes, can also enhance hardware efficiency. This is because such architectures can be less stiff than traditional fully connected neural networks and can be optimized using techniques like learning rate annealing inspired by the ADAM algorithm.\n\n## Hybrid Attention-SSM Architectures Implementation Details\n\n- The \"Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models\" by Ren et al. (2024) provides a detailed implementation of hybrid architectures that combine state space models (SSMs) with selective attention mechanisms. This approach selectively compresses sequences into recurrent hidden states while maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories, substantially outperforming pure attention or SSM models[Analysis Note].\n\n- The \"Hungry Hungry Hippos\" paper by Dao et al. (2022) identifies key limitations of pure SSM approaches and proposes solutions through hybrid architectures. This work highlights the importance of integrating attention mechanisms to address recall limitations and compare tokens across sequences effectively[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage continuous-time formulations, sparse computation techniques, and hardware-efficient matrix operations, all within a hybrid attention-SSM architecture. This approach can enhance the model's performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Score: 0.90)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection (Avg. Score: 0.38)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/35 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03234, 2024.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/31 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nPeng, B., Goldstein, D., Anthony, Q., Albalak, A., Alcaide, E., Biderman, S., Cheah, E., Du, X., Ferdinan, T., Hou, H., Kazienko, P., GV, K.

It's Raw! Audio Generation with State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale state space models*\n\n*Karan Goel, Albert Gu, Chris Donahue, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling, is proposed, identifying that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and providing a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Developing architectures suitable for modeling raw audio is a challenging problem due to the high sampling rates of audio waveforms. Standard sequence modeling approaches like RNNs and CNNs have previously been tailored to fit the demands of audio, but the resultant architectures make undesirable computational tradeoffs and struggle to model waveforms effectively. We propose SaShiMi, a new multi-scale architecture for waveform modeling built around the recently introduced S4 model for long sequence modeling. We identify that S4 can be unstable during autoregressive generation, and provide a simple improvement to its parameterization by drawing connections to Hurwitz matrices. SaShiMi yields state-of-the-art performance for unconditional waveform generation in the autoregressive setting. Additionally, SaShiMi improves non-autoregressive generation performance when used as the backbone architecture for a diffusion model. Compared to prior architectures in the autoregressive generation setting, SaShiMi generates piano and speech waveforms which humans find more musical and coherent respectively, e.g. 2x better mean opinion scores than WaveNet on an unconditional speech generation task. On a music generation task, SaShiMi outperforms WaveNet on density estimation and speed at both training and inference even when using 3x fewer parameters.

Our model uses a computationally efficient inference scheme on multiple time scales for highly accurate long-horizon predictions and uncertainty estimates over several seconds into the future. Our experiments, which focus on action conditional long horizon future predictions, show that MTS3 outperforms recent methods on several system identification benchmarks including complex simulated and real-world dynamical systems.

The 3D autodecoder framework embeds properties learned from the target dataset in the latent space, which can then be decoded into a volumetric representation for rendering view-consistent appearance and geometry. We then identify the appropriate intermediate volumetric latent space, and introduce robust normalization and de-normalization operations to learn a 3D diffusion from 2D images or monocular videos of rigid or articulated objects. Our approach is flexible enough to use either existing camera supervision or no camera information at all -- instead efficiently learning it during training. Our evaluations demonstrate that our generation results outperform state-of-the-art alternatives on various benchmark datasets and metrics, including multi-view image datasets of synthetic objects, real in-the-wild videos of moving people, and a large-scale, real video dataset of static objects.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Naor, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new measure called mask-diversity is suggested which correlates with the expected accuracy of the different types of structural pruning, and a novel transposable fine-grained sparsity mask is suggested, which guarantees that both the weight matrix and its transpose follow the same sparsity pattern.\n\n**Abstract:** Unstructured pruning reduces the memory footprint in deep neural networks (DNNs). Recently, researchers proposed different types of structural pruning intending to reduce also the computation complexity. In this work, we first suggest a new measure called mask-diversity which correlates with the expected accuracy of the different types of structural pruning. We focus on the recently suggested N:M fine-grained block sparsity mask, in which for each block of M weights, we have at least N zeros. While N:M fine-grained block sparsity allows acceleration in actual modern hardware, it can be used only to accelerate the inference phase. In order to allow for similar accelerations in the training phase, we suggest a novel transposable fine-grained sparsity mask, where the same mask can be used for both forward and backward passes. Our transposable mask guarantees that both the weight matrix and its transpose follow the same sparsity pattern; thus, the matrix multiplication required for passing the error backward can also be accelerated. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal transposable-mask as a minimum-cost flow problem. Additionally, to speed up the minimum-cost flow computation, we also introduce a fast linear-time approximation that can be used when the masks dynamically change during training. Our experiments suggest a 2x speed-up in the matrix multiplications with no accuracy degradation over vision and language models. Finally, to solve the problem of switching between different structure constraints, we suggest a method to convert a pre-trained model with unstructured sparsity to an N:M fine-grained block sparsity model with little to no training.

Sparse Weight Activation Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient sparse computation*\n\n*Md Aamir Raihan, Tor M. Aamodt*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sarse Weight Activation Training (SWAT), an algorithm that embodies these observations, is proposed that reduces computations by 50% to 80% with better accuracy at a given level of sparsity versus the Dynamic Sparse Graph algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network training is computationally and memory intensive. Sparse training can reduce the burden on emerging hardware platforms designed to accelerate sparse computations, but it can affect network convergence. In this work, we propose a novel CNN training algorithm Sparse Weight Activation Training (SWAT). SWAT is more computation and memory-efficient than conventional training. SWAT modifies back-propagation based on the empirical insight that convergence during training tends to be robust to the elimination of (i) small magnitude weights during the forward pass and (ii) both small magnitude weights and activations during the backward pass. We evaluate SWAT on recent CNN architectures such as ResNet, VGG, DenseNet and WideResNet using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets. For ResNet-50 on ImageNet SWAT reduces total floating-point operations (FLOPS) during training by 80% resulting in a 3.3$\\times$ training speedup when run on a simulated sparse learning accelerator representative of emerging platforms while incurring only 1.63% reduction in validation accuracy. Moreover, SWAT reduces memory footprint during the backward pass by 23% to 50% for activations and 50% to 90% for weights.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 6. PENNI: Pruned Kernel Sharing for Efficient CNN Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient sparse computation*\n\n*Shiyu Li, Edward Hanson, H. Li, Yiran Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** PENNI is proposed, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints.\n\n**Abstract:** Although state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs achieve outstanding performance on various tasks, their high computation demand and massive number of parameters make it difficult to deploy these SOTA CNNs onto resource-constrained devices. Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution layers via a small number of basis kernels and (2) alternately adjusting bases and coefficients with sparse constraints. Experiments show that we can prune 97% parameters and 92% FLOPs on ResNet18 CIFAR10 with no accuracy loss, and achieve 44% reduction in run-time memory consumption and a 53% reduction in inference latency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Causal Navigation by Continuous-time Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time neural networks*\n\n*Charles J. Vorbach, Ramin M. Hasani, Alexander Amini, Mathias Lechner, Daniela Rus*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate that causal continuous-time deep models can perform robust navigation tasks, where advanced recurrent models fail, and learn complex causal control representations directly from raw visual inputs and scale to solve a variety of tasks using imitation learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Imitation learning enables high-fidelity, vision-based learning of policies within rich, photorealistic environments. However, such techniques often rely on traditional discrete-time neural models and face difficulties in generalizing to domain shifts by failing to account for the causal relationships between the agent and the environment. In this paper, we propose a theoretical and experimental framework for learning causal representations using continuous-time neural networks, specifically over their discrete-time counterparts. We evaluate our method in the context of visual-control learning of drones over a series of complex tasks, ranging from short- and long-term navigation, to chasing static and dynamic objects through photorealistic environments. Our results demonstrate that causal continuous-time deep models can perform robust navigation tasks, where advanced recurrent models fail. These models learn complex causal control representations directly from raw visual inputs and scale to solve a variety of tasks using imitation learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Toward Equation of Motion for Deep Neural Networks: Continuous-time Gradient Descent and Discretization Error Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time neural networks*\n\n*Taiki Miyagawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** EoM highlights differences between continuous-time and discrete-time GD, indicating the importance of the counter term for a better description of the discrete learning dynamics of GD.\n\n**Abstract:** We derive and solve an ``Equation of Motion'' (EoM) for deep neural networks (DNNs), a differential equation that precisely describes the discrete learning dynamics of DNNs. Differential equations are continuous but have played a prominent role even in the study of discrete optimization (gradient descent (GD) algorithms). However, there still exist gaps between differential equations and the actual learning dynamics of DNNs due to discretization error. In this paper, we start from gradient flow (GF) and derive a counter term that cancels the discretization error between GF and GD. As a result, we obtain EoM, a continuous differential equation that precisely describes the discrete learning dynamics of GD. We also derive discretization error to show to what extent EoM is precise. In addition, we apply EoM to two specific cases: scale- and translation-invariant layers. EoM highlights differences between continuous-time and discrete-time GD, indicating the importance of the counter term for a better description of the discrete learning dynamics of GD. Our experimental results support our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MSFMamba: Multi-Scale Feature Fusion State Space Model for Multi-Source Remote Sensing Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale state space models*\n\n*Qian Du, Junyu Dong, Xiaowei Zhou, Xuepeng Jin, Feng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** In multi-source remote sensing image classification field, remarkable progress has been made by convolutional neural network and Transformer. However, existing methods are still limited due to the inherent local reductive bias. Recently, Mamba-based methods built upon the State Space Model have shown great potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, but it has rarely been explored for the multi-source remote sensing image classification task. To this end, we propose Multi-Scale Feature Fusion Mamba (MSFMamba) network for hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR/SAR data joint classification. Specifically, MSFMamba mainly comprises three parts: Multi-Scale Spatial Mamba (MSpa-Mamba) block, Spectral Mamba (Spe-Mamba) block, and Fusion Mamba (Fus-Mamba) block. Specifically, to solve the feature redundancy in multiple canning routes, the MSpa-Mamba block incorporates the multi-scale strategy to minimize the computational redundancy and alleviate the feature redundancy of SSM. In addition, Spe-Mamba is designed for spectral feature exploration, which is essential for HSI feature modeling. Moreover, to alleviate the heterogeneous gap between HSI and LiDAR/SAR data, we design Fus-Mamba block for multi-source feature fusion. The original Mamba is extended to accommodate dual inputs, and cross-modal feature interaction is enhanced. Extensive experimental results on three multi-source remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superiority performance of the proposed MSFMamba over the state-of-the-art models. Source codes of MSFMamba will be made public available at https://github.com/summitgao/MSFMamba .\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Multi-Scale VMamba: Hierarchy in Hierarchy Visual State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale state space models*\n\n*Chang Xu, Minjing Dong, Yuheng Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the significant achievements of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in various vision tasks, they are constrained by the quadratic complexity. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered widespread attention due to their global receptive field and linear complexity with respect to the input length, demonstrating substantial potential across fields including natural language processing and computer vision. To improve the performance of SSMs in vision tasks, a multi-scan strategy is widely adopted, which leads to significant redundancy of SSMs. For a better trade-off between efficiency and performance, we analyze the underlying reasons behind the success of the multi-scan strategy, where long-range dependency plays an important role. Based on the analysis, we introduce Multi-Scale Vision Mamba (MSVMamba) to preserve the superiority of SSMs in vision tasks with limited parameters. It employs a multi-scale 2D scanning technique on both original and downsampled feature maps, which not only benefits long-range dependency learning but also reduces computational costs. Additionally, we integrate a Convolutional Feed-Forward Network (ConvFFN) to address the lack of channel mixing. Our experiments demonstrate that MSVMamba is highly competitive, with the MSVMamba-Tiny model achieving 82.8% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 46.9% box mAP, and 42.2% instance mAP with the Mask R-CNN framework, 1x training schedule on COCO, and 47.6% mIoU with single-scale testing on ADE20K.Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/YuHengsss/MSVMamba}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. DeepSpeed Inference: Enabling Efficient Inference of Transformer Models at Unprecedented Scale\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient sparse computation*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Olatunji Ruwase, Shaden Smith, Jeff Rasley, Elton Zheng, Du Li, Cheng Li, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Minjia Zhang, Samyam Rajbhandari, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** The past several years have witnessed the success of transformer-based models, and their scale and application scenarios continue to grow aggressively. The current landscape of transformer models is increasingly diverse: the model size varies drastically with the largest being of hundred-billion parameters; the model characteristics differ due to the sparsity introduced by the Mixture-of-Experts; the target application scenarios can be latency-critical or throughput-oriented; the deployment hardware could be single- or multi-GPU systems with different types of memory and storage, etc. With such increasing diversity and the fast-evolving pace of transformer models, designing a highly performant and efficient inference system is extremely challenging. In this paper, we present DeepSpeed Inference, a comprehensive system solution for transformer model inference to address the above-mentioned challenges. DeepSpeed Inference consists of (1) a multi-GPU inference solution to minimize latency while maximizing the throughput of both dense and sparse transformer models when they fit in aggregate GPU memory, and (2) a heterogeneous inference solution that leverages CPU and NVMe memory in addition to the GPU memory and compute to enable high inference throughput with large models which do not fit in aggregate GPU memory. DeepSpeed Inference reduces latency by up to 7.3X over the state-of-the-art for latency-oriented scenarios and increases throughput by over 1.5x for throughput-oriented scenarios. Moreover, it enables trillion parameter scale inference under real-time latency constraints by leveraging hundreds of GPUs, an unprecedented scale for inference. It can inference 25x larger models than with GPU-only solutions, while delivering a high throughput of 84 TFLOPS (over $50\\%$ of A6000 peak).\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. Scalable and Efficient MoE Training for Multitask Multilingual Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient sparse computation*\n\n*Hany Hassan Awadalla, Yuxiong He, Samyam Rajbhandari, Amr Hendy, Liyang Lu, Andres Felipe Cruz Salinas, Alexandre Muzio, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Young Jin Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** The Mixture of Experts (MoE) models are an emerging class of sparsely activated deep learning models that have sublinear compute costs with respect to their parameters. In contrast with dense models, the sparse architecture of MoE offers opportunities for drastically growing model size with significant accuracy gain while consuming much lower compute budget. However, supporting large scale MoE training also has its own set of system and modeling challenges. To overcome the challenges and embrace the opportunities of MoE, we first develop a system capable of scaling MoE models efficiently to trillions of parameters. It combines multi-dimensional parallelism and heterogeneous memory technologies harmoniously with MoE to empower 8x larger models on the same hardware compared with existing work. Besides boosting system efficiency, we also present new training methods to improve MoE sample efficiency and leverage expert pruning strategy to improve inference time efficiency. By combining the efficient system and training methods, we are able to significantly scale up large multitask multilingual models for language generation which results in a great improvement in model accuracy. A model trained with 10 billion parameters on 50 languages can achieve state-of-the-art performance in Machine Translation (MT) and multilingual natural language generation tasks. The system support of efficient MoE training has been implemented and open-sourced with the DeepSpeed library.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-22\n\n\n\n#### 5. Continuous and Discrete-Time Survival Prediction with Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time neural networks*\n\n*\u00d8rnulf Borgan, H\u00e5vard Kvamme*\n\n**Abstract:** Application of discrete-time survival methods for continuous-time survival prediction is considered. For this purpose, a scheme for discretization of continuous-time data is proposed by considering the quantiles of the estimated event-time distribution, and, for smaller data sets, it is found to be preferable over the commonly used equidistant scheme. Furthermore, two interpolation schemes for continuous-time survival estimates are explored, both of which are shown to yield improved performance compared to the discrete-time estimates. The survival methods considered are based on the likelihood for right-censored survival data, and parameterize either the probability mass function (PMF) or the discrete-time hazard rate, both with neural networks. Through simulations and study of real-world data, the hazard rate parametrization is found to perform slightly better than the parametrization of the PMF. Inspired by these investigations, a continuous-time method is proposed by assuming that the continuous-time hazard rate is piecewise constant. The method, named PC-Hazard, is found to be highly competitive with the aforementioned methods in addition to other methods for survival prediction found in the literature.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time neural networks*\n\n*Ivana Kaji\u0107, Chris Eliasmith, Aaron Voelker*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\\mathcal{O}( d / \\sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher evaluate and enhance the proposal for the **MultiScaleRetNet**, here are some key areas to focus on and the most relevant information that can be gathered:\n\n### Novelty Compared to Existing Research\n\n#### Multi-Scale State Space Models\n- **HiPPO and S4 Models**: These models are known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nW.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Neural Lyapunov Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems with Stability Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability in neural networks*\n\n*Rui Zhou, Thanin Quartz, H. Sterck, Jun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A learning framework to simultaneously stabilize an unknown nonlinear system with a neural controller and learn a neural Lyapunov function to certify a region of attraction (ROA) for the closed-loop system is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning for control of dynamical systems with formal guarantees remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a learning framework to simultaneously stabilize an unknown nonlinear system with a neural controller and learn a neural Lyapunov function to certify a region of attraction (ROA) for the closed-loop system. The algorithmic structure consists of two neural networks and a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. The first neural network is responsible for learning the unknown dynamics. The second neural network aims to identify a valid Lyapunov function and a provably stabilizing nonlinear controller. The SMT solver then verifies that the candidate Lyapunov function indeed satisfies the Lyapunov conditions. We provide theoretical guarantees of the proposed learning framework in terms of the closed-loop stability for the unknown nonlinear system. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach with a set of numerical experiments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Neural Lyapunov Control for Discrete-Time Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability in neural networks*\n\n*Junlin Wu, Andrew Clark, Y. Kantaros, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in a broad class of discrete-time systems and is the first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.\n\n**Abstract:** While ensuring stability for linear systems is well understood, it remains a major challenge for nonlinear systems. A general approach in such cases is to compute a combination of a Lyapunov function and an associated control policy. However, finding Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, several methods have been proposed that represent Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, such approaches either focus on continuous-time systems, or highly restricted classes of nonlinear dynamics. We propose the first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in a broad class of discrete-time systems. Three key ingredients enable us to effectively learn provably stable control policies. The first is a novel mixed-integer linear programming approach for verifying the discrete-time Lyapunov stability conditions, leveraging the particular structure of these conditions. The second is a novel approach for computing verified sublevel sets. The third is a heuristic gradient-based method for quickly finding counterexamples to significantly speed up Lyapunov function learning. Our experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For example, on the path tracking benchmark, we outperform recent neural Lyapunov control baselines by an order of magnitude in both running time and the size of the region of attraction, and on two of the four benchmarks (cartpole and PVTOL), ours is the first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.

This paper investigates GNNs derived from diverse neural flows, concentrating on their connection to various stability notions such as BIBO stability, Lyapunov stability, structural stability, and conservative stability. We argue that Lyapunov stability, despite its common use, does not necessarily ensure adversarial robustness. Inspired by physics principles, we advocate for the use of conservative Hamiltonian neural flows to construct GNNs that are robust to adversarial attacks. The adversarial robustness of different neural flow GNNs is empirically compared on several benchmark datasets under a variety of adversarial attacks. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that GNNs leveraging conservative Hamiltonian flows with Lyapunov stability substantially improve robustness against adversarial perturbations.

Many properties of single RNNs are well characterized theoretically, but experimental neuroscience has moved in the direction of studying multiple interacting areas, and RNN theory needs to be likewise extended. We take a constructive approach towards this problem, leveraging tools from nonlinear control theory and machine learning to characterize when combinations of stable RNNs will themselves be stable. Importantly, we derive conditions which allow for massive feedback connections between interacting RNNs. We parameterize these conditions for easy optimization using gradient-based techniques, and show that stability-constrained\"networks of networks\"can perform well on challenging sequential-processing benchmark tasks.

Why can they fit random labels even given non-convex and non-smooth architectures? Most existing theory only covers networks with one hidden layer, so can we go deeper? \nIn this paper, we focus on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are multi-layer networks widely used in natural language processing. They are harder to analyze than feedforward neural networks, because the $\\textit{same}$ recurrent unit is repeatedly applied across the entire time horizon of length $L$, which is analogous to feedforward networks of depth $L$. We show when the number of neurons is sufficiently large, meaning polynomial in the training data size and in $L$, then SGD is capable of minimizing the regression loss in the linear convergence rate. This gives theoretical evidence of how RNNs can memorize data. \nMore importantly, in this paper we build general toolkits to analyze multi-layer networks with ReLU activations. For instance, we prove why ReLU activations can prevent exponential gradient explosion or vanishing, and build a perturbation theory to analyze first-order approximation of multi-layer networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 181  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n#### 6.

However, this observed efficiency is not yet entirely explained by theory. It is known that a certain class of multiplicative RNNs enjoys the property of depth efficiency --- a shallow network of exponentially large width is necessary to realize the same score function as computed by such an RNN. Such networks, however, are not very often applied to real life tasks. In this work, we attempt to reduce the gap between theory and practice by extending the theoretical analysis to RNNs which employ various nonlinearities, such as Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), and show that they also benefit from properties of universality and depth efficiency.

StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis in state space models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.

Peters*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a stability analysis tool for controllers acting on dynamics represented by Gaussian processes, and considers arbitrary Markovian control policies and system dynamics given as (i) the mean of a GP, and (ii) the full GP distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning control has become an appealing alternative to the derivation of control laws based on classic control theory. However, a major shortcoming of learning control is the lack of performance guarantees which prevents its application in many real-world scenarios. As a step in this direction, we provide a stability analysis tool for controllers acting on dynamics represented by Gaussian processes (GPs). We consider arbitrary Markovian control policies and system dynamics given as (i) the mean of a GP, and (ii) the full GP distribution. For the first case, our tool finds a state space region, where the closed-loop system is provably stable. In the second case, it is well known that infinite horizon stability guarantees cannot exist. Instead, our tool analyzes finite time stability.

Sinkhorn Natural Gradient for Generative Models\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis in state space models*\n\n*Zebang Shen, Zhenfu Wang, Alejandro Ribeiro, Hamed Hassani*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of minimizing a functional over a parametric family of probability measures, where the parameterization is characterized via a push-forward structure. An important application of this problem is in training generative adversarial networks. In this regard, we propose a novel Sinkhorn Natural Gradient (SiNG) algorithm which acts as a steepest descent method on the probability space endowed with the Sinkhorn divergence. We show that the Sinkhorn information matrix (SIM), a key component of SiNG, has an explicit expression and can be evaluated accurately in complexity that scales logarithmically with respect to the desired accuracy. This is in sharp contrast to existing natural gradient methods that can only be carried out approximately. Moreover, in practical applications when only Monte-Carlo type integration is available, we design an empirical estimator for SIM and provide the stability analysis. In our experiments, we quantitatively compare SiNG with state-of-the-art SGD-type solvers on generative tasks to demonstrate its efficiency and efficacy of our method.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 10. Tuning Recurrent Neural Networks with Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: control theory in recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Natasha Jaques, S. Gu, Richard E. Turner, D. Eck*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel sequence-learning approach in which a pre-trained RNN is used to supply part of the reward value in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model, which can refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data.\n\n**Abstract:** The approach of training sequence models using supervised learning and next-step prediction suffers from known failure modes. For example, it is notoriously difficult to ensure multi-step generated sequences have coherent global structure. We propose a novel sequence-learning approach in which we use a pre-trained Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to supply part of the reward value in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) model. Thus, we can refine a sequence predictor by optimizing for some imposed reward functions, while maintaining good predictive properties learned from data. We propose efficient ways to solve this by augmenting deep Q-learning with a cross-entropy reward and deriving novel off-policy methods for RNNs from KL control. We explore the usefulness of our approach in the context of music generation. An LSTM is trained on a large corpus of songs to predict the next note in a musical sequence. This Note-RNN is then refined using our method and rules of music theory. We show that by combining maximum likelihood (ML) and RL in this way, we can not only produce more pleasing melodies, but significantly reduce unwanted behaviors and failure modes of the RNN, while maintaining information learned from data.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 103  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 11. Codebook Features: Sparse and Discrete Interpretability for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-discrete hybrid neural networks*\n\n*Alex Tamkin, Mohammad Taufeeque, Noah D. Goodman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies codes in Transformer language models representing diverse, disentangled concepts and finds that they can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference, and appears to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.\n\n**Abstract:** Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense, continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Continuous vs. Discrete Optimization of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-discrete hybrid neural networks*\n\n*Omer Elkabetz, Nadav Cohen*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is hypothesized that the theory of gradient flows will unravel mysteries behind deep learning, and it is shown that over deep neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient flow trajectories enjoy favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing analyses of optimization in deep learning are either continuous, focusing on (variants of) gradient flow, or discrete, directly treating (variants of) gradient descent. Gradient flow is amenable to theoretical analysis, but is stylized and disregards computational efficiency. The extent to which it represents gradient descent is an open question in the theory of deep learning. The current paper studies this question. Viewing gradient descent as an approximate numerical solution to the initial value problem of gradient flow, we find that the degree of approximation depends on the curvature around the gradient flow trajectory. We then show that over deep neural networks with homogeneous activations, gradient flow trajectories enjoy favorable curvature, suggesting they are well approximated by gradient descent. This finding allows us to translate an analysis of gradient flow over deep linear neural networks into a guarantee that gradient descent efficiently converges to global minimum almost surely under random initialization. Experiments suggest that over simple deep neural networks, gradient descent with conventional step size is indeed close to gradient flow. We hypothesize that the theory of gradient flows will unravel mysteries behind deep learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 13. Re-Think and Re-Design Graph Neural Networks in Spaces of Continuous Graph Diffusion Functionals\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-discrete hybrid neural networks*\n\n*Tingting Dan, Jiaqi Ding, Ziquan Wei, S. Kovalsky, Minjeong Kim, Won Hwa Kim, Guorong Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel generative adversarial network (GAN) is proposed that predicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation to mitigate vanishing flows, and the objective function is customized to minimize transportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used in domains like social networks and biological systems. However, the locality assumption of GNNs, which limits information exchange to neighboring nodes, hampers their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global patterns in graphs. To address this, we propose a new inductive bias based on variational analysis, drawing inspiration from the Brachistochrone problem. Our framework establishes a mapping between discrete GNN models and continuous diffusion functionals. This enables the design of application-specific objective functions in the continuous domain and the construction of discrete deep models with mathematical guarantees. To tackle over-smoothing in GNNs, we analyze the existing layer-by-layer graph embedding models and identify that they are equivalent to l2-norm integral functionals of graph gradients, which cause over-smoothing. Similar to edge-preserving filters in image denoising, we introduce total variation (TV) to align the graph diffusion pattern with global community topologies. Additionally, we devise a selective mechanism to address the trade-off between model depth and over-smoothing, which can be easily integrated into existing GNNs. Furthermore, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that predicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation. To mitigate vanishing flows, we customize the objective function to minimize transportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows. Our GNN models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on popular graph learning benchmarks such as Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 10 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. The Lyapunov Neural Network: Adaptive Stability Certification for Safe Learning of Dynamical Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability in neural networks*\n\n*Andreas Krause, Felix Berkenkamp, Spencer M. Richards*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning algorithms have shown considerable prowess in simulation by allowing\nrobots to adapt to uncertain environments and improve their performance.\nHowever, such algorithms are rarely used in practice on safety-critical\nsystems, since the learned policy typically does not yield any safety\nguarantees. That is, the required exploration may cause physical harm to the\nrobot or its environment. In this paper, we present a method to learn accurate\nsafety certificates for nonlinear, closed-loop dynamical systems. Specifically,\nwe construct a neural network Lyapunov function and a training algorithm that\nadapts it to the shape of the largest safe region in the state space. The\nalgorithm relies only on knowledge of inputs and outputs of the dynamics,\nrather than on any specific model structure. We demonstrate our method by\nlearning the safe region of attraction for a simulated inverted pendulum.\nFurthermore, we discuss how our method can be used in safe learning algorithms\ntogether with statistical models of dynamical systems.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. Lyapunov-stable neural-network control\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability in neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Specifically, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our approach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer linear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition, or generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute an inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system. We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D quadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a baseline LQR controller.

Arabisc: Context-Sensitive Neural Spelling Checker\n\n*From Search Query: control theory applied to recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Andy Way, Rejwanul Haque, Yasmin Moslem*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional statistical approaches to spelling correction usually consist of two consecutive processes \u2014 error detection and correction \u2014 and they are generally computationally intensive. Current state-of-the-art neural spelling correction models usually attempt to correct spelling errors directly over an entire sentence, which, as a consequence, lacks control of the process, e.g. they are prone to overcorrection. In recent years, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular long short-term memory (LSTM) hidden units, have proven increasingly popular and powerful models for many natural language processing (NLP) problems. Accordingly, we made use of a bidirectional LSTM language model (LM) for our context-sensitive spelling detection and correction model which is shown to have much control over the correction process. While the use of LMs for spelling checking and correction is not new to this line of NLP research, our proposed approach makes better use of the rich neighbouring context, not only from before the word to be corrected, but also after it, via a dual-input deep LSTM network. Although in theory our proposed approach can be applied to any language, we carried out our experiments on Arabic, which we believe adds additional value given the fact that there are limited linguistic resources readily available in Arabic in comparison to many languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in both improving the quality of correction suggestions and minimising overcorrection.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Poincar\u00e9 Recurrence, Cycles and Spurious Equilibria in Gradient-Descent-Ascent for Non-Convex Non-Concave Zero-Sum Games\n\n*From Search Query: control theory applied to recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Emmanouil-Vasileios Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis, Lampros Flokas, Georgios Piliouras*\n\n**Abstract:** We study a wide class of non-convex non-concave min-max games that generalizes over standard bilinear zero-sum games. In this class, players control the inputs of a smooth function whose output is being applied to a bilinear zero-sum game. This class of games is motivated by the indirect nature of the competition in Generative Adversarial Networks, where players control the parameters of a neural network while the actual competition happens between the distributions that the generator and discriminator capture. We establish theoretically, that depending on the specific instance of the problem gradient-descent-ascent dynamics can exhibit a variety of behaviors antithetical to convergence to the game theoretically meaningful min-max solution. Specifically, different forms of recurrent behavior (including periodicity and Poincar\\'e recurrence) are possible as well as convergence to spurious (non-min-max) equilibria for a positive measure of initial conditions. At the technical level, our analysis combines tools from optimization theory, game theory and dynamical systems.\n\n**Conference:** poincare-recurrence-cycles-and-spurious-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Sibling-Attack: Rethinking Transferable Adversarial Attacks against Face Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis in state space models*\n\n*Cong Liu, Simin Chen, Shouhong Ding, Juefeng Guo, Taiping Yao, Bangjie Yin, Zexin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** A hard challenge in developing practical face recognition (FR) attacks is due to the black-box nature of the target FR model, i.e., inaccessible gradient and parameter information to attackers. While recent research took an important step towards attacking black-box FR models through leveraging transferability, their performance is still limited, especially against online commercial FR systems that can be pessimistic (e.g., a less than 50% ASR--attack success rate on average). Motivated by this, we present Sibling-Attack, a new FR attack technique for the first time explores a novel multi-task perspective (i.e., leveraging extra information from multi-correlated tasks to boost attacking transferability). Intuitively, Sibling-Attack selects a set of tasks correlated with FR and picks the Attribute Recognition (AR) task as the task used in Sibling-Attack based on theoretical and quantitative analysis. Sibling-Attack then develops an optimization framework that fuses adversarial gradient information through (1) constraining the cross-task features to be under the same space, (2) a joint-task meta optimization framework that enhances the gradient compatibility among tasks, and (3) a cross-task gradient stabilization method which mitigates the oscillation effect during attacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sibling-Attack outperforms state-of-the-art FR attack techniques by a non-trivial margin, boosting ASR by 12.61% and 55.77% on average on state-of-the-art pre-trained FR models and two well-known, widely used commercial FR systems.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-22\n\n\n\n#### 6. The Geometry of Culture: Analyzing Meaning through Word Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis in state space models*\n\n*James A. Evans, Matt Taddy, Austin C. Kozlowski*\n\n**Abstract:** We demonstrate the utility of a new methodological tool, neural-network word\nembedding models, for large-scale text analysis, revealing how these models\nproduce richer insights into cultural associations and categories than possible\nwith prior methods. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words\nas geometric relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space,\noperationalizing a relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary\ntheories of identity and culture. We show that dimensions induced by word\ndifferences (e.g. man - woman, rich - poor, black - white, liberal -\nconservative) in these vector spaces closely correspond to dimensions of\ncultural meaning, and the projection of words onto these dimensions reflects\nwidely shared cultural connotations when compared to surveyed responses and\nlabeled historical data. We pilot a method for testing the stability of these\nassociations, then demonstrate applications of word embeddings for\nmacro-cultural investigation with a longitudinal analysis of the coevolution of\ngender and class associations in the United States over the 20th century and a\ncomparative analysis of historic distinctions between markers of gender and\nclass in the U.S. and Britain. We argue that the success of these\nhigh-dimensional models motivates a move towards \"high-dimensional theorizing\"\nof meanings, identities and cultural processes.\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 7. On Neural Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: control theory in recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Patrick Kidger*\n\n**Abstract:** The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-04\n\n\n\n#### 8. Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\n*From Search Query: control theory in recurrent neural networks*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Tri Dao, Khaled Saab, Karan Goel, Isys Johnson, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Conference:** combining-recurrent-convolutional-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 9. 4D Spatio-Temporal ConvNets: Minkowski Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-discrete hybrid neural networks*\n\n*Christopher Choy, Silvio Savarese, JunYoung Gwak*\n\n**Abstract:** In many robotics and VR/AR applications, 3D-videos are readily-available sources of input (a continuous sequence of depth images, or LIDAR scans). However, those 3D-videos are processed frame-by-frame either through 2D convnets or 3D perception algorithms. In this work, we propose 4-dimensional convolutional neural networks for spatio-temporal perception that can directly process such 3D-videos using high-dimensional convolutions. For this, we adopt sparse tensors and propose the generalized sparse convolution that encompasses all discrete convolutions. To implement the generalized sparse convolution, we create an open-source auto-differentiation library for sparse tensors that provides extensive functions for high-dimensional convolutional neural networks. We create 4D spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks using the library and validate them on various 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks and proposed 4D datasets for 3D-video perception. To overcome challenges in the 4D space, we propose the hybrid kernel, a special case of the generalized sparse convolution, and the trilateral-stationary conditional random field that enforces spatio-temporal consistency in the 7D space-time-chroma space. Experimentally, we show that convolutional neural networks with only generalized 3D sparse convolutions can outperform 2D or 2D-3D hybrid methods by a large margin. Also, we show that on 3D-videos, 4D spatio-temporal convolutional neural networks are robust to noise, outperform 3D convolutional neural networks and are faster than the 3D counterpart in some cases.\n\n**Conference:** 4d-spatio-temporal-convnets-minkowski-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-18\n\n\n\n#### 10. 3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-discrete hybrid neural networks*\n\n*John Flynn, Jana Kosecka, Dragomir Anguelov, Arsalan Mousavian*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method for 3D object detection and pose estimation from a single\nimage. In contrast to current techniques that only regress the 3D orientation\nof an object, our method first regresses relatively stable 3D object properties\nusing a deep convolutional neural network and then combines these estimates\nwith geometric constraints provided by a 2D object bounding box to produce a\ncomplete 3D bounding box. The first network output estimates the 3D object\norientation using a novel hybrid discrete-continuous loss, which significantly\noutperforms the L2 loss. The second output regresses the 3D object dimensions,\nwhich have relatively little variance compared to alternatives and can often be\npredicted for many object types. These estimates, combined with the geometric\nconstraints on translation imposed by the 2D bounding box, enable us to recover\na stable and accurate 3D object pose. We evaluate our method on the challenging\nKITTI object detection benchmark both on the official metric of 3D orientation\nestimation and also on the accuracy of the obtained 3D bounding boxes. Although\nconceptually simple, our method outperforms more complex and computationally\nexpensive approaches that leverage semantic segmentation, instance level\nsegmentation and flat ground priors and sub-category detection.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper seeks to enable compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation, and introduces architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in attention-free sequence models rely on convolutions as alternatives to the attention operator at the core of Transformers. In particular, long convolution sequence models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many domains, but incur a significant cost during auto-regressive inference workloads -- naively requiring a full pass (or caching of activations) over the input sequence for each generated token -- similarly to attention-based models. In this paper, we seek to enable $\\mathcal O(1)$ compute and memory cost per token in any pre-trained long convolution architecture to reduce memory footprint and increase throughput during generation. Concretely, our methods consist in extracting low-dimensional linear state-space models from each convolution layer, building upon rational interpolation and model-order reduction techniques. We further introduce architectural improvements to convolution-based layers such as Hyena: by weight-tying the filters across channels into heads, we achieve higher pre-training quality and reduce the number of filters to be distilled. The resulting model achieves 10x higher throughput than Transformers and 1.5x higher than Hyena at 1.3B parameters, without any loss in quality after distillation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/64 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

Efficiency Our distillation methods for constant-memory, high throughput inference in long convolution sequence models (LCSMs) can lead to energy savings during model deployement, enabling processing of longer-form content at a fraction of the cost and reducing environmental impact. Improved efficiency may also affect other aspects of AI safety, as it may make it easier produce malicious or harmful content. Accessibility By improving the efficiency of training and generation,LCSMs and LaughingHyena may contribute to increased accessibility of large language models, lowering the hardware barrier to entry for individuals and organizations with limited resources. Steerability New method based on LCSMs enable sequence models to process long-form prompts previously inaccessible by Transformers, which may lead to increased control over models via e.g., conditioning on additional instructions [45]. ## References\n\n[1] Daniel Y Fu et al. \"Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\".

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 328  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 2.

Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Lyapunov stability\" \"state-space models\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Controlled Differential Equations on Long Sequences via Non-standard Wavelets\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Sourav Pal, Zhanpeng Zeng, Sathya Ravi, Vikas Singh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural variant of this idea yields consistent improvements across a wide gamut of use cases tackled in existing works, and a novel application on modeling tasks involving coupled differential equations is described.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Controlled Differential equations (NCDE) are a powerful mechanism to model the dynamics in temporal sequences, e.g., applications involving physiological measures, where apart from the initial condition, the dynamics also depend on subsequent measures or even a different \"control\" sequence. But NCDEs do not scale well to longer sequences. Existing strategies adapt rough path theory, and instead model the dynamics over summaries known as log signatures. While rigorous and elegant, invertibility of these summaries is difficult, and limits the scope of problems where these ideas can offer strong benefits (reconstruction, generative modeling). For tasks where it is sensible to assume that the (long) sequences in the training data are a fixed length of temporal measurements - this assumption holds in most experiments tackled in the literature - we describe an efficient simplification. First, we recast the regression/classification task as an integral transform. We then show how restricting the class of operators (permissible in the integral transform), allows the use of a known algorithm that leverages non-standard Wavelets to decompose the operator. Thereby, our task (learning the operator) radically simplifies. A neural variant of this idea yields consistent improvements across a wide gamut of use cases tackled in existing works. We also describe a novel application on modeling tasks involving coupled differential equations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. How Does Information Bottleneck Help Deep Learning?\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Kenji Kawaguchi, Zhun Deng, Xu Ji, Jiaoyang Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides the first rigorous learning theory for justifying the benefit of information bottleneck in deep learning by mathematically relating information bottleneck to generalization errors and introduces new generalization bounds that scale with the degree of information bottlenecks.\n\n**Abstract:** Numerous deep learning algorithms have been inspired by and understood via the notion of information bottleneck, where unnecessary information is (often implicitly) minimized while task-relevant information is maximized. However, a rigorous argument for justifying why it is desirable to control information bottlenecks has been elusive. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous learning theory for justifying the benefit of information bottleneck in deep learning by mathematically relating information bottleneck to generalization errors. Our theory proves that controlling information bottleneck is one way to control generalization errors in deep learning, although it is not the only or necessary way. We investigate the merit of our new mathematical findings with experiments across a range of architectures and learning settings. In many cases, generalization errors are shown to correlate with the degree of information bottleneck: i.e., the amount of the unnecessary information at hidden layers. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for current and future methods through the lens of information bottleneck. Our new generalization bounds scale with the degree of information bottleneck, unlike the previous bounds that scale with the number of parameters, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, stability or robustness.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Lyapunov stability\" \"state-space models\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs\nlike the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities\nintroduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications. In this\npaper, we propose an advanced architecture that mitigates these challenges by\ndecomposing A-multiplications into multiple groups and optimizing positional\nencoding through Grouped Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. This new\nstructure, denoted as Grouped FIR-enhanced SSM (GFSSM), employs semiseparable\nmatrices for efficient computation. Furthermore, inspired by the \"attention\nsink\" phenomenon identified in streaming language models, we incorporate a\nsimilar mechanism to enhance the stability and performance of our model over\nextended sequences. Our approach further bridges the gap between SSMs and\nTransformer architectures, offering a viable path forward for scalable and\nhigh-performing sequence modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-01T02:49:58Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-01T02:49:58Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. SlimIPL: Language-Model-Free Iterative Pseudo-Labeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Lyapunov stability\" \"state-space models\" \"sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Tatiana Likhomanenko, Qiantong Xu, Jacob Kahn, Gabriel Synnaeve, Ronan Collobert*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent results in end-to-end automatic speech recognition have demonstrated\nthe efficacy of pseudo-labeling for semi-supervised models trained both with\nConnectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and Sequence-to-Sequence (seq2seq)\nlosses. Iterative Pseudo-Labeling (IPL), which continuously trains a single\nmodel using pseudo-labels iteratively re-generated as the model learns, has\nbeen shown to further improve performance in ASR. We improve upon the IPL\nalgorithm: as the model learns, we propose to iteratively re-generate\ntranscriptions with hard labels (the most probable tokens), that is, without a\nlanguage model. We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and\ngive a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based\nmodels. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces\nsensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improves\ntraining stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5-4x fewer\ncomputational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art\nsemi/self-supervised approaches. With only 10 hours of labeled audio, slimIPL\nis competitive with self-supervised approaches, and is state-of-the-art with\n100 hours of labeled audio without the use of a language model both at test\ntime and during pseudo-label generation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T08:36:33Z  (*Updated: 2021-08-30T02:29:45Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Stephen Baccus, Yoshua Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large\nTransformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building\nblock of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in\nsequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing\nsubquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be\ncombined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in\ncapability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement\nfor attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long\nconvolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on\nsequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves\naccuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and\nother implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a\nnew state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language\nmodeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer\nquality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length\n2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence\nlength 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-21T18:29:25Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-19T20:08:39Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Vision Mamba: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Xiao Liu, Chenxu Zhang, Lei Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze\nthe behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications\nin several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and\nmachine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to\nprocess sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language\nprocessing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state\nspace, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In\nparticular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP,\nespecially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity.\nNotably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying\nparameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient\ntraining and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range\ndependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI\narchitecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have\nattempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general\nvision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis,\nby extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully\nunderstand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and\npresent a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a\nvariety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent\nadvances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains.

Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\n*From Search Query: \"control theory\" \"deep learning\" \"long sequences\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Tri Dao, Khaled Saab, Karan Goel, Isys Johnson, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Conference:** combining-recurrent-convolutional-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as **MultiScaleRetNet**, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the analysis:\n\n## Key Innovations and Goals\n\n- **Multi-Scale State Processing**: The proposal involves parallel continuous and discrete state updates to capture dependencies at different temporal resolutions.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Sparse Computation**: This includes using structured sparsity patterns to improve computational efficiency and reduce memory usage.\n- **Theoretical Stability Mechanisms**: Integrating control theory-based stability controls, particularly Lyapunov stability methods, to ensure stable training and inference.\n\n## Relevant References and Insights\n\n### Control Theory and Stability\n\n- **Neural Lyapunov Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems with Stability Guarantees (Zhou et al., 2022)**: This work demonstrates the application of Lyapunov stability in neural network control systems, which is directly relevant to the proposal's stability mechanisms.\n- **Neural Lyapunov Control for Discrete-Time Systems (Wu et al., 2023)**: This study focuses on discrete-time systems and provides methods to ensure stability using Lyapunov functions, which aligns with the proposal's approach.\n- **Contracting Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Stable Neural Networks (Revay et al., 2020)**: This paper uses control theory to analyze and improve the stability of deep neural networks, offering theoretical guarantees for convergence and robustness.\n\n### Multi-Scale Processing and State-Space Models\n\n- **Liquid Structural State-Space Models (Hasani et al., 2023)**: This work introduces continuous-time models (Liquid Time-Constant networks) in state-space models to improve long-term dependency modeling, similar to the proposal's use of continuous and discrete state updates.\n- **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN) for Sequence Modeling (Qin et al., 2023)**: This introduces hierarchical processing in RNNs, which relates to the multi-scale state processing in the proposal.\n\n### Practical Implementation and Efficiency\n\n- **StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-Space Models through Stable Reparameterization (Wang & Li, 2023)**: This paper addresses stability in state-space models by proposing reparameterization techniques that can enhance optimization stability without significant computational overhead.\n- **RNNs of RNNs: Recursive Construction of Stable Assemblies of Recurrent Neural Networks (Kozachkov et al., 2021)**: This study discusses stability in RNNs using control theory and suggests methods to ensure stable assemblies while maintaining performance.\n\n## Future Search Plan and Key Queries\n\n### Investigate Practical Implementations of Lyapunov Stability\n\n- **Search Keywords:** \"Lyapunov stability\" \"state-space models\" \"sequence modeling\"\n  - **Description:** Research papers that detail efficient methods for integrating Lyapunov-based stability mechanisms into neural network architectures, particularly focusing on maintaining computational efficiency and scalability in models designed for long-sequence processing.\n\n### Explore Methods for Efficient Integration of Stability Mechanisms\n\n- **Internal Library Search Description:** Research papers detailing efficient integration of Lyapunov-based stability mechanisms into neural networks designed for long-sequence processing, focusing on maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Design Plan\n\n### 4.1 Multi-Scale State Processing\n\n```python\nclass MultiScaleStateUnit(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_scales):\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.scale_projectors = nn.ModuleList([\n            ScaleProjector(hidden_size, 2**i) \n            for i in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n        \n    def forward(self, x, states):\n        # Process at different time scales\n        outputs = []\n        for i, projector in enumerate(self.scale_projectors):\n            scale_state = states[i]\n            # Parallel continuous/discrete updates\n            cont_update = self.continuous_update(x, scale_state)\n            disc_update = self.discrete_update(x, scale_state)\n            # Adaptive combination\n            alpha = self.compute_scale_weight(x, i)\n            new_state = alpha * cont_update + (1-alpha) * disc_update\n            outputs.append(new_state)\n            states[i] = new_state\n        \n        return self.combine_scales(outputs), states\n```\n\n### 4.2 Hardware-Efficient Sparse Computation\n\n```python\nclass SparseProcessor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, block_size=32):\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.block_size = block_size\n        self.pattern_generator = StructuredPatternGenerator(block_size)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Generate hardware-friendly sparsity pattern\n        mask = self.pattern_generator(x)\n        # Block-sparse computation\n        blocks = x.view(-1, self.block_size, x.size(-1))\n        sparse_out = self.compute_block_sparse(blocks, mask)\n        return sparse_out.view(x.shape)\n        \n    def compute_block_sparse(self, blocks, mask):\n        # Efficient block-sparse matrix operations\n        return self.apply_structured_sparsity(blocks, mask)\n```\n\n### 4.3 Stability Mechanism\n\n```python\nclass StabilityController(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size):\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.cont_projector = ContinuousStateProjector(hidden_size)\n        \n    def forward(self, states, dt):\n        # Continuous-time stability control\n        stability_weights = self.compute_stability_weights(states)\n        return self.apply_stability_control(states, stability_weights, dt)\n```\n\n### 4.4 Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe multi-scale state update follows:\n\ns_t^i = \u03b1_i \u22c5 \u03d5_c(s_{t-1}^i, x_t) + (1-\u03b1_i) \u22c5 \u03d5_d(s_{t-1}^i, x_t)\n\nwhere:\n- s_t^i is the state at scale i\n- \u03b1_i is the adaptive scale weight\n- \u03d5_c and \u03d5_d are continuous and discrete update functions\n\nThe stability guarantee is based on the Lyapunov function:\n\nV(s_t) = \u2211_i w_i \u22c5 s_t^i^T P_i s_t^i\n\nwhere P_i are positive definite matrices and w_i are scale weights.\n\n## 5. Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 5.1 Multi-Scale Processing Implementation\n\n1. Scale initialization:\n```python\ndef initialize_scales(hidden_size, num_scales):\n    return [torch.zeros(hidden_size) for _ in range(num_scales)]\n```\n\n2. Update computation:\n```python\ndef compute_updates(x, state, scale):\n    cont = continuous_update_step(x, state, scale)\n    disc = discrete_update_step(x, state, scale)\n    return cont, disc\n```\n\n### 5.2 Hardware Optimization\n\n1. Block-sparse patterns:\n```python\ndef generate_block_pattern(x, block_size):\n    # Generate hardware-efficient sparsity pattern\n    blocks = x.view(-1, block_size, x.size(-1))\n    return create_structured_mask(blocks)\n```\n\n2. Efficient computation:\n```python\ndef efficient_sparse_compute(x, mask, block_size):\n    # Hardware-optimized sparse operations\n    return apply_block_sparse_ops(x, mask, block_size)\n```\n\n## 6.
