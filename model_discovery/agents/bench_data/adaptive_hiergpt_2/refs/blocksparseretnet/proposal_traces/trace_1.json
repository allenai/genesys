The key contributions and findings from the search are as follows:\n\n- **Novelty**: The application of matrix-valued states specifically to RetNetMLP is novel. While matrix-valued states have been explored in other architectures like **RWKV** (Peng et al., 2024) and **HGRN2** (Qin et al., 2024), these concepts have not been applied to RetNet or RetNetMLP. Therefore, the proposal offers a unique contribution to the field.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Introducing matrix-valued states increases computational and memory complexity (O(d\u00b2)). However, techniques such as **low-rank approximations** (Tai et al., 2016), **efficient tensor operations**, and **weight sharing and compression** (Razavi et al., 2019) can mitigate these overheads. The use of **block-based processing** can optimize hardware utilization, improve memory access patterns, and enhance computational efficiency.\n\n- **Training Stability**: Incorporating **normalization techniques** (Ba et al., 2016), **regularization methods**, and **gradient control** is essential to maintain training stability when using large or high-dimensional states.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends**: The proposal aligns with ongoing efforts to enhance model expressivity and efficiency, leveraging hardware optimizations.

Without effective mitigation strategies, this could limit the practical applicability of the model to large-scale language tasks.\n\n2. **Implementation Complexity**: The design adds complexity to the RetNetMLP module, potentially increasing the difficulty of implementation, debugging, and maintenance. Ensuring compatibility with existing frameworks and optimizing performance may require significant effort.\n\n3. **Training Stability Risks**: Despite proposed stability controls, training models with matrix-valued states may present challenges such as vanishing or exploding gradients, requiring careful tuning and validation.\n\n4. **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The proposal lacks empirical results or benchmarks demonstrating the effectiveness of the modifications. Without experimental evidence, it's uncertain how the proposed changes will impact actual model performance.\n\n5. **Hardware Dependency**: The efficiency gains from block-based processing are contingent on hardware capabilities and optimizations. The model's performance may vary across different hardware setups, potentially limiting accessibility.\n\n### Evaluation of the Design\n\n#### Accuracy and Robustness\n\n- **Potential Improvements**: The increased expressivity from matrix-valued states may enhance the model's ability to capture complex patterns, potentially improving accuracy on language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Risks**: Without empirical validation, it's unclear whether these theoretical benefits will translate into practical performance gains.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Efficient Attention via Control Variates (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2023)\t**Cited by** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/52 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027, 2020.

Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: control variate attention, efficient variance reduction, hardware efficient attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Prompt-to-Prompt Image Editing with Cross Attention Control\n\n*From Search Query: control variate attention*\n\n*Amir Hertz, Ron Mokady, J. Tenenbaum, Kfir Aberman, Y. Pritch, D. Cohen-Or*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes a text-conditioned model in depth and observes that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt, and presents several applications which monitor the image synthesis by editing the textual prompt only.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent large-scale text-driven synthesis models have attracted much attention thanks to their remarkable capabilities of generating highly diverse images that follow given text prompts. Such text-based synthesis methods are particularly appealing to humans who are used to verbally describe their intent. Therefore, it is only natural to extend the text-driven image synthesis to text-driven image editing. Editing is challenging for these generative models, since an innate property of an editing technique is to preserve most of the original image, while in the text-based models, even a small modification of the text prompt often leads to a completely different outcome. State-of-the-art methods mitigate this by requiring the users to provide a spatial mask to localize the edit, hence, ignoring the original structure and content within the masked region. In this paper, we pursue an intuitive prompt-to-prompt editing framework, where the edits are controlled by text only. To this end, we analyze a text-conditioned model in depth and observe that the cross-attention layers are the key to controlling the relation between the spatial layout of the image to each word in the prompt. With this observation, we present several applications which monitor the image synthesis by editing the textual prompt only. This includes localized editing by replacing a word, global editing by adding a specification, and even delicately controlling the extent to which a word is reflected in the image. We present our results over diverse images and prompts, demonstrating high-quality synthesis and fidelity to the edited prompts.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1260  (*Influential: 198*)\n\n#### 2. Deep Transformers without Shortcuts: Modifying Self-attention for Faithful Signal Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: control variate attention*\n\n*Bobby He, James Martens, Guodong Zhang, Aleksandar Botev, Andy Brock, Samuel L. Smith, Y. Teh*\n\n**TL;DR:** Several approaches are designed that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking.\n\n**Abstract:** Skip connections and normalisation layers form two standard architectural components that are ubiquitous for the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but whose precise roles are poorly understood. Recent approaches such as Deep Kernel Shaping have made progress towards reducing our reliance on them, using insights from wide NN kernel theory to improve signal propagation in vanilla DNNs (which we define as networks without skips or normalisation). However, these approaches are incompatible with the self-attention layers present in transformers, whose kernels are intrinsically more complicated to analyse and control. And so the question remains: is it possible to train deep vanilla transformers? We answer this question in the affirmative by designing several approaches that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers. Our methods address various intricacies specific to signal propagation in transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking. In experiments on WikiText-103 and C4, our approaches enable deep transformers without normalisation to train at speeds matching their standard counterparts, and deep vanilla transformers to reach the same performance as standard ones after about 5 times more iterations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

However, the stochastic meta-gradient can have large variance due to data sampling (from each task) and task sampling (from the whole task distribution), leading to slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates variance reduction with first-order meta-learning algorithms such as Rep-tile. It retains the bilevel formulation which better captures the structure of meta-learning, but does not require storing the vast number of task-specific parameters in general bilevel variance reduction methods. Theoretical results show that it has fast convergence rate due to variance reduction. Experiments on benchmark few-shot classification data sets demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithms with and without variance reduction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Variance Reduction is an Antidote to Byzantines: Better Rates, Weaker Assumptions and Communication Compression as a Cherry on the Top\n\n*From Search Query: efficient variance reduction*\n\n*Eduard A. Gorbunov, Samuel Horv\u00e1th, Peter Richt'arik, Gauthier Gidel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz loss functions are derived and theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz loss functions are derived.\n\n**Abstract:** Byzantine-robustness has been gaining a lot of attention due to the growth of the interest in collaborative and federated learning. However, many fruitful directions, such as the usage of variance reduction for achieving robustness and communication compression for reducing communication costs, remain weakly explored in the \ufb01eld. This work addresses this gap and proposes Byz-VR-MARINA \u2013a new Byzantine-tolerant method with variance reduction and compression. A key mes-sage of our paper is that variance reduction is key to \ufb01ghting Byzantine workers more effectively. At the same time, communication compression is a bonus that makes the process more communication ef\ufb01cient. We derive theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz loss functions. Unlike the con-current Byzantine-robust methods with variance reduction and/or compression, our complexity results are tight and do not rely on restrictive assumptions such as boundedness of the gradients or limited compression. Moreover, we provide the \ufb01rst analysis of a Byzantine-tolerant method supporting non-uniform sampling of stochastic gradients. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical \ufb01ndings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner.

HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured\n  LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that\nprocess multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of\ntokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative\ndecoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications\nare inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during\nattention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose\nFlattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the\nKV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU\nutilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and\nnearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves\nup to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three\npractical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention\nalgorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-30T04:34:54Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: control variate attention*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Jianbo Yuan, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: control variate attention*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Communication-Efficient Distributed Optimization in Networks with Gradient Tracking and Variance Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: efficient variance reduction*\n\n*Yuxin Chen, Yuejie Chi, Shicong Cen, Boyue Li*\n\n**Abstract:** There is growing interest in large-scale machine learning and optimization over decentralized networks, e.g. in the context of multi-agent learning and federated learning. Due to the imminent need to alleviate the communication burden, the investigation of communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms - particularly for empirical risk minimization - has flourished in recent years. A large fraction of these algorithms have been developed for the master/slave setting, relying on a central parameter server that can communicate with all agents. This paper focuses on distributed optimization over networks, or decentralized optimization, where each agent is only allowed to aggregate information from its neighbors. By properly adjusting the global gradient estimate via local averaging in conjunction with proper correction, we develop a communication-efficient approximate Newton-type method Network-DANE, which generalizes DANE to the decentralized scenarios. Our key ideas can be applied in a systematic manner to obtain decentralized versions of other master/slave distributed algorithms. A notable development is Network-SVRG/SARAH, which employs variance reduction to further accelerate local computation. We establish linear convergence of Network-DANE and Network-SVRG for strongly convex losses, and Network-SARAH for quadratic losses, which shed light on the impacts of data homogeneity, network connectivity, and local averaging upon the rate of convergence. We further extend Network-DANE to composite optimization by allowing a nonsmooth penalty term. Numerical evidence is provided to demonstrate the appealing performance of our algorithms over competitive baselines, in terms of both communication and computation efficiency. Our work suggests that performing a certain amount of local communications and computations per iteration can substantially improve the overall efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sample Efficient Policy Gradient Methods with Recursive Variance Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: efficient variance reduction*\n\n*Felicia Gao, Quanquan Gu, Pan Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the sample efficiency in reinforcement learning has been a long-standing research problem. In this work, we aim to reduce the sample complexity of existing policy gradient methods. We propose a novel policy gradient algorithm called SRVR-PG, which only requires $O(1/\\epsilon^{3/2})$ episodes to find an $\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point of the nonconcave performance function $J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ (i.e., $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ such that $\\|\\nabla J(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\|_2^2\\leq\\epsilon$). This sample complexity improves the existing result $O(1/\\epsilon^{5/3})$ for stochastic variance reduced policy gradient algorithms by a factor of $O(1/\\epsilon^{1/6})$. In addition, we also propose a variant of SRVR-PG with parameter exploration, which explores the initial policy parameter from a prior probability distribution. We conduct numerical experiments on classic control problems in reinforcement learning to validate the performance of our proposed algorithms.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-18\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Although the provided sources do not directly discuss control variates in attention mechanisms, the concept is similar to using control variates in other estimation problems to reduce variance. For example, the idea of using control variates to reduce variance in estimators, as mentioned in the context of quantum dynamics, can be analogously applied to attention mechanisms. The paper \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates\" by Zheng et al. (2023) would be a direct reference for this, though it is not included in the search results provided.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Variance Reduction in Attention Computation\n- Theoretical analysis of variance reduction in attention computation would involve understanding how control variates can stabilize gradients and reduce the variance of attention scores. This is akin to the stabilization of gradients in scaled dot-product attention, where scores are divided by the square root of the dimension of the key vectors to prevent large values.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Attention Variants\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" provides insights into hardware-efficient implementations of attention mechanisms. It discusses how memristor crossbar arrays can perform matrix operations in an analog manner, which is more efficient than traditional digital implementations. This approach can significantly reduce the number of MAC (Multiply-Accumulate) operations required for self-attention computations.\n\n## Specific Details About Control Variate Estimation in Deep Learning\n- While the provided sources do not delve into control variate estimation specifically, the general principle involves using a known, low-variance estimator to adjust the primary estimator, thereby reducing overall variance. In the context of deep learning, this could mean using a simpler attention mechanism as a control variate to adjust the more complex attention computations, potentially reducing the variance and improving stability during training.\n\n## Novel Attention Mechanisms and Efficiency Beyond Sparsity\n- The concept of block-sparse attention patterns, as discussed in \"Lightning Attention-2,\" offers a novel approach to handling unlimited sequence lengths efficiently. This could be integrated into RetNetMLP to improve its efficiency without relying solely on sparsity.\n- \"Short-Long Convolutions\" propose a mix of local and global processing, which can be more hardware-efficient than hierarchical compression methods. This approach could be combined with attention mechanisms to enhance both efficiency and the ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\n## Key Takeaways for Future Research\n- **Control Variates**: Investigate how control variates can be applied to reduce variance in attention computations, potentially improving the stability and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n- **Block-Sparse Attention**: Explore the implementation of block-sparse attention patterns to handle long sequences efficiently, which could be more effective than dynamic importance scoring.\n- **Mixed Local and Global Processing**: Research how combining local and global processing, such as through short-long convolutions, can be integrated with attention mechanisms to enhance efficiency and capture long-range dependencies.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage novel attention mechanisms and hardware-efficient implementations.\n",

The batch size is set to 64 across\n\n[^4]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5520e6e7b143a538a399g-32.jpg?height=545&width=1414&top_left_y=266&top_left_x=353)\n\nFigure 2: Left and right: Additional empirical memory consumption and running time comparison for different attention mechanisms under various sequence lengths. 8 V100 GPUs, and the statistics are computed by averaging the results of 30 runs. Besides, in our ablation study, the efficiency metrics reported in Table 6 and Table 7 are evaluated under the same setup used during training. Remark on Modeling Short Sequences. Unfortunately, similar to most previous efficient attention baselines, EVA also runs slower than softmax attention under shorter sequences (e.g., length of 128 or 256), but it soon catches up in running speed, and the reduction of memory consumption is still significant. Besides, in short-sequence settings (such as the case of DeiT-Tiny/Small with sequences of 196 tokens), EVA often performs on par with or better than conventional softmax attention (see Table 1, whereas most previous attention variants usually perform much worse. This implies EVA can achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and quality: for short sequences, EVA is possible to achieve stronger performance competitive with softmax attention (despite in longer running time); while for long sequences, EVA can be run much faster with less memory. Comparison to Memory-efficient Attention Mechanisms. In this section, we conduct an empirical efficiency comparison between efficient approximate attention methods and FlashAttention, one of the memory-efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe \\& Staats, 2021, Dao et al., 2022) with optimized memory accesses. FlashAttention computes the exact softmax attention in an online manner without materializing the full attention matrix, achieving linear memory complexity with respect to sequence lengths; besides, both runtime and memory usage are further improved by minimizing IO accesses. We benchmark different attention modules on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, where we measure the memory usage and runtime of running a single attention block, consisting of 8 attention heads with 512 embedding dimension size, for both a forward and backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that FlashAttention achieves significant memory usage reduction for softmax attention approximation and even consumes much less memory than all considered approximate baselines under all sequence lengths. In terms of runtime, we notice that FlashAttention runs faster than most attention baselines under sequence lengths less than 2048 despite scaling quadratically, but EVA, along with other more efficient approximate variants, begin to catch up at longer sequence lengths. This implies that the quadratic computational costs of softmax attention still bottleneck its runtime performance, aligning with one of the main findings in Dao et al. (2022). According to this empirical study, we observe that FlashAttention offers a general and effective technique to speed up softmax attention; since many approximate variants (including EVA) exhibit a similar formulation to softmax attention (e.g., Equation 16), we expect they can also benefit from the optimized online softmax calculation technique and memory accesses of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). ## F EXPERIMENTS on Long RANGE ArEnA\n\nLong Range Arena (LRA; Tay et al. 2021) is a lightweight benchmark that assesses the ability of efficient attention methods to model long sequences in diverse domains. We follow the same hyper-parameter setup as Xiong et al. (2021b) to re-evaluate all attention baselines and report the\n\nTable 15: Classification accuracy (\\%) on LRA benchmark with different efficient attention mechanisms. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Avg. |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Softmax | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 6}$ | 64.91 | 80.70 | 40.61 | 68.29 | 58.63 |\n| Linformer | 38.21 | 53.91 | 77.66 | 39.40 | 66.44 | 55.12 |\n| Performer | 29.84 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 3 0}$ | 77.70 | 38.29 | 66.39 | 55.50 |\n| Reformer | 27.12 | 63.90 | 78.08 | 42.40 | 51.90 | 52.69 |\n| Scatterbrain | 38.21 | 64.04 | 77.83 | 42.51 | 60.62 | 56.64 |\n| Combiner | 38.26 | 63.98 | 81.47 | 42.80 | 55.94 | 56.49 |\n| LARA | 37.10 | 64.62 | 80.82 | 38.99 | 68.96 | 58.10 |\n| Nystr\u00f6mformer | 38.46 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 2 8}$ | 80.44 | 39.71 | 68.98 | 58.57 |\n| Local | 38.46 | 63.70 | 80.71 | 42.25 | 68.46 | 58.72 |\n| Long-short | 38.56 | 63.46 | $\\mathbf{8 1 . 7 3}$ | 40.54 | $\\mathbf{7 1 . 2 8}$ | 59.11 |\n| EVA | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 1}$ | 64.31 | 80.21 | $\\mathbf{4 3 . 2 4}$ | 70.90 | $\\mathbf{5 9 . 4 5}$ |\n\ncomparison in Table 15. We observe that EVA largely improves previous RFA methods such as Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), and performs competitively with full softmax attention. Notably, EVA even achieves better average results over all tasks, with higher accuracy on Image and Pathfinder benchmarks, suggesting its capability of capturing long-term dependencies. For LRA benchmark, we set all attention-specific hyper-parameters to 128 (e.g., the number of landmarks in Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al. 2021b) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), the window size in local attention and Combiner (Ren et al., 2021), etc.). We set $|E|=128$ and $C=64$ by default for EVA without any further tuning and find this setup works well. ## G Connections to Other AtTEntion Mechanisms\n\n## G. 1 RFA, SoftmAx AtTEntion, And EVA\n\nAs mentioned in our main text, one of the main contributions of this work is to develop a more general framework that bridges RFA and conventional softmax attention. To see how EVA (Equation 13) achieves this goal formally, note that if either $|E|=M$ or $C=M$, EVA would be equivalent to standard softmax attention; while if we set $|E|=0$ and $C=1$, EVA would recover vanilla RFA. ## G. 2 CONNECTIONS TO LARA\n\nNotably, EVA and LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) are two efficient attention mechanisms that are both built upon the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) formulation of RFAs. LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) puts the main focus on the proposal distribution used in SNIS and tries to design importance sampling proposals that are closer to the true underlying distribution. The proposed usage of multiple proposals further improves the estimation quality of SNIS and achieves strong empirical performance while still keeping linear complexity. In contrast to LARA, in this work we do not focus on the design choice of proposals used in importance sampling but aim to generalize the SNIS formulation further via control variates. As demonstrated in \\$3.2 our theory clearly delineates how the gap between such SNIS estimation and softmax attention can be closed by manipulating control variates. Since LARA and RFA are both SNIS estimators (their main difference lies in the choice of proposal distributions), our generalization also applies to LARA. To summarize, compared with LARA, EVA is a more general framework and improves conventional RFA from an orthogonal perspective. ## G. 3 Connections to Clustered AtTEntion\n\nClustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) is an efficient attention mechanism that first clusters the set of queries into multiple groups, computes the mean centroid of each group, and then performs attention between query centroids and original key-value pairs. This framework is fast and effective and enjoys well-bounded approximation error. Clustered attention and EVA share some similarities in two aspects. First, both of them adopt the partitioning technique to reduce the computational complexity while remaining effective; and secondly, both observe that the efficient attention mechanism can be improved by refining the approximation over specific elements. For instance, clustered attention can be improved (Vyas et al., 2020) by selecting top- $k$ key-value pairs that are most relevant to each centroid and then refining the approximation by recomputing attention weights over these keys using original queries; while EVA notices that we can directly employ the optimal control variate coefficient for a subset of key-value pairs $(m \\in E)$ while still remaining efficient, which yields a more accurate approximation. Nevertheless, our main technical contribution is to develop a control variate formulation in the context of RFA and demonstrate that how RFA can be further improved locally. On the other hand, while clustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) clusters queries, EVA partitions key-value pairs. This property makes EVA more amenable to the case of autoregressive language modeling since we do not impose clustering structures over the query set, and thus the causal relation among queries can be well maintained. ## G. 4 CONNECTIONS TO COMBINER\n\nCombiner (Ren et al. 2021) is a recently proposed attention mechanism that also partitions the sequence into chunks combined with local attention. The key difference between EVA and Combiner is the motivation, where Combiner introduces a structured factorization over the attention probability distribution, while our approach is built from the control variate perspective. ## G. 5 CONNECTIONS TO SCATTERbRAIN\n\nIn this section, we show that Scatterbrain (Chen et al., 2021a) can be cast as a special case of our framework EVA, although they are proposed based on quite different motivations. A Brief Review of Scatterbrain. Scatterbrain (Chen et al, 2021a) notes that sparse attention and RFA can approximate sharp and flat regions of the softmax attention matrix well, respectively. Based on this insight, Scatterbrain is proposed to first compute a Performer approximation to softmax attention and then cancel out the approximation error on critical regions via a sparse mechanism. Specifically, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) defines a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$ ) so that for each $(n, m) \\in \\mathbf{S}$ that indexes a non-zero entry. For notational simplicity, we also denote $\\operatorname{Supp}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{(i, j) \\mid S_{i j} \\neq 0\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{m \\mid S_{n m} \\neq 0\\right\\}$.

Scatterbrain is a Special Case of EVA. For notational convenience, we denote $E:=\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$. According to Proposition 1, suppose we employ optimal coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{m}$ for all entries in $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$, and use the same coefficient $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ for all the remaining entries (in other words, we let $C=1$ and the whole index set is only partitioned into two subsets $\\{E,[M] \\backslash E\\})$.

Partitioning Strategy. EVA significantly improves random feature approximation by trying to locally estimate each subset of tokens, which is a much easier task than approximating the whole sequence as in previous RFA methods. To achieve this, EVA partitions the whole token sequence into multiple subsets according to the current query position $n$, which is denoted by $\\left\\{E^{n}, \\mathcal{P}_{1}^{n}, \\mathcal{P}_{2}^{n}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{P}_{C}^{n}\\right\\}_{n=1}^{N} \\square^{3}$ For elements in subset $E^{n}$, we optimize the control variate coefficient to give an exact estimate for each single token $m \\in E^{n}$. In addition, we impose T5-style relative positional encoding (Raffel et al. 2020a) over elements in $E^{n}$. While for some other subset $\\mathcal{P}_{c}$, we employ the shared coefficient to approximate all tokens belonging to $\\mathcal{P}_{c}$. We assume all $E^{1}, \\ldots, E^{N}$ are of the same cardinality $K$, and $\\left|\\mathcal{P}_{c}^{n}\\right|$ is the same for any $c=1, \\ldots, C$ and $n=1, \\ldots, N$. The partition strategy $\\left\\{E^{n}, \\mathcal{P}_{1}^{n}, \\mathcal{P}_{2}^{n}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{P}_{C}^{n}\\right\\}_{n=1}^{N}$ is decided based on a simple criterion:\n\n- for $E^{n}$, it contains $K$ local neighbors with respect to each query $n$. To further simplify implementation and reduce memory usage, we chunk the whole sequence into contiguous blocks of size $K$, and all adjacent queries belonging to the same block will share this block as the subset $E^{n}$;\n- as for $\\mathcal{P}_{1}^{n}, \\mathcal{P}_{2}^{n}, \\ldots, \\mathcal{P}_{C}^{n}$, we follow a similar treatment by splitting the complement $[M] \\backslash E^{n}$ into $C$ contiguous chunks of the same size. For ease of implementation, we simply partition the whole index set $[M]$ into multiple groups instead of $[M] \\backslash E^{n}$, which circumvents the overload for explicitly performing set difference operations in practical implementation. Although this leads to extra approximation error, this amounts to putting more attention weights on tokens belonging to the subset $E$ and we found this approximation does not lead to performance degradation (Table 8). ## D A CAuSAl VARIANT OF EVA\n\nIn this section, we describe the causal variant of EVA, where each query can only attend to historical tokens.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 4.

URL https://openreview.net/ forum?id=G-uNfHKrj46. ## A Hedgehog implementation details\n\nWe provide further details on the Hedgehog feature map and attention weight distillation training. ## A. 1 Mechanics for Hedgehog feature map\n\nTo improve Hedgehog performance in practice, we explored variations along two additional criteria for numerical stability and improved expressivity. Numerical stability In practice, we find that computing $\\Phi$ as the softmax applied over the MLP output dimension also seems to work but with better stability. In this case, we expand Eq. 3 as\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{mlp}}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\left[\\frac{\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)}, \\ldots, \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{d}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}\\right)}\\right]\n$$\n\n(also performing better than dividing each element by the max over $\\left.\\left\\{\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\right)\\right\\}_{i=1}^{d}\\right)$\nNegation mapping. To better compute dot products as a similarity measure between queries and keys, in practice we also set $\\Phi$ as a mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{2 d}$, e.g., via\n\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{mlp}}(\\boldsymbol{x})=\\left[\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\right), \\ldots, \\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{w}_{d}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{b}\\right), \\exp \\left(-\\boldsymbol{w}_{1}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{b}\\right), \\ldots, \\exp \\left(-\\boldsymbol{w}_{d}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{x}-\\boldsymbol{b}\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere the additional negation mapping in $\\mathbb{R}^{2 d}$ intuitively lets us better factor in negative dimensionalities, which prior linear attention feature maps like ReLU ignore. While this results in a larger feature dimension, it only scales by a fixed constant 2 such that the overall time and space complexity for Hedgehog linear attention is still $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$. We further find that in practice, this still accomplishes favorable scaling and much faster inference with smaller memory than the Taylor exponential discussed in Sec. 4.1 (see Fig. 6 for real-world wall-clock time and memory savings). ## A. 2 Hedgehog feature map and model architecture\n\nWe apply Hedgehog feature maps for each head and layer individually in a standard Transformer architecture, where the addition of head-specific MLPs is akin to inserting \"adapters\" (Houlsby et al., 2019) after every query and key projection. Each MLP is a single linear layer with input and output dimensions equal to the base Transformer's head dimension. Pytorch-like code is given below. ```\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nclass HedgehogFeatureMap(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, head_dim: int, activation: str = 'exp'):\n        super().__init__()\n        # Trainable map\n        self.layer = nn.Linear(head_dim, head_dim)\n        self.init_weights_()\n    def self.init_weights_(self):\n    \"\"\" Initialize trainable map as identity\"\"\"\n    nn.init.eye_(self.layer.weight)\n    nn.init.zeros_(self.layer.bias)\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor):\n        x = self.layer(x) # shape b, h, l, d\n    return torch.cat([torch.exp(x), torch.exp(-x)], dim=-1)\n```\n\n\n## A. 3 Hedgehog Distillation and Finetuning Implementation Details\n\nWe include additional details for training Hedgehog layers to obtain linear attention Transformers.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: control variate neural networks, variance reduction attention, efficient attention implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, GCN computes the representation of a node recursively from its neighbors, making the receptive field size grow exponentially with the number of layers. Previous attempts on reducing the receptive field size by subsampling neighbors do not have a convergence guarantee, and their receptive field size per node is still in the order of hundreds. In this paper, we develop control variate based algorithms which allow sampling an arbitrarily small neighbor size. Furthermore, we prove new theoretical guarantee for our algorithms to converge to a local optimum of GCN. Empirical results show that our algorithms enjoy a similar convergence with the exact algorithm using only two neighbors per node. The runtime of our algorithms on a large Reddit dataset is only one seventh of previous neighbor sampling algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 461  (*Influential: 68*)\n\n#### 2. Towards Robust Neural Networks via Close-loop Control\n\n*From Search Query: control variate neural networks*\n\n*Zhuotong Chen, Qianxiao Li, Zheng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the robustness issue of neural networks by a novel close-loop control method from the perspective of dynamic systems and can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustity against many types of data perturbations.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their success in massive engineering applications, deep neural networks are vulnerable to various perturbations due to their black-box nature. Recent study has shown that a deep neural network can misclassify the data even if the input data is perturbed by an imperceptible amount. In this paper, we address the robustness issue of neural networks by a novel close-loop control method from the perspective of dynamic systems. Instead of modifying the parameters in a fixed neural network architecture, a close-loop control process is added to generate control signals adaptively for the perturbed or corrupted data. We connect the robustness of neural networks with optimal control using the geometrical information of underlying data to design the control objective. The detailed analysis shows how the embedding manifolds of state trajectory affect error estimation of the proposed method. Our approach can simultaneously maintain the performance on clean data and improve the robustness against many types of data perturbations. It can also further improve the performance of robustly trained neural networks against different perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves the robustness of neural networks with close-loop control.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Especially, its variance reduced versions have nowadays gained particular attention. In this paper, we study two variants of this kind, namely, the Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient Langevin Dynamics and the Stochastic Recursive Gradient Langevin Dynamics. We prove their convergence to the objective distribution in terms of KL-divergence under the sole assumptions of smoothness and Log-Sobolev inequality which are weaker conditions than those used in prior works for these algorithms. With the batch size and the inner loop length set to $\\sqrt{n}$, the gradient complexity to achieve an $\\epsilon$-precision is $\\tilde{O}((n+dn^{1/2}\\epsilon^{-1})\\gamma^2 L^2\\alpha^{-2})$, which is an improvement from any previous analyses.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

GraphSAINT: Graph Sampling Based Inductive Learning Method\n\n*From Search Query: variance reduction attention*\n\n*Ajitesh Srivastava, Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Hongkuan Zhou, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are powerful models for learning representations of attributed graphs. To scale GCNs to large graphs, state-of-the-art methods use various layer sampling techniques to alleviate the \"neighbor explosion\" problem during minibatch training. We propose GraphSAINT, a graph sampling based inductive learning method that improves training efficiency and accuracy in a fundamentally different way. By changing perspective, GraphSAINT constructs minibatches by sampling the training graph, rather than the nodes or edges across GCN layers. Each iteration, a complete GCN is built from the properly sampled subgraph. Thus, we ensure fixed number of well-connected nodes in all layers. We further propose normalization technique to eliminate bias, and sampling algorithms for variance reduction. Importantly, we can decouple the sampling from the forward and backward propagation, and extend GraphSAINT with many architecture variants (e.g., graph attention, jumping connection). GraphSAINT demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and training time on five large graphs, and achieves new state-of-the-art F1 scores for PPI (0.995) and Reddit (0.970).\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 4. ViTAEv2: Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring Inductive Bias for Image Recognition and Beyond\n\n*From Search Query: variance reduction attention*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Jing Zhang, Yufei Xu, Qiming Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great potential in various computer vision tasks owing to their strong capability to model long-range dependency using the self-attention mechanism. Nevertheless, they treat an image as a 1D sequence of visual tokens, lacking an intrinsic inductive bias (IB) in modeling local visual structures and dealing with scale variance, which is instead learned implicitly from large-scale training data with longer training schedules. In this paper, we propose a Vision Transformer Advanced by Exploring intrinsic IB from convolutions, i.e., ViTAE. Technically, ViTAE has several spatial pyramid reduction modules to downsample and embed the input image into tokens with rich multi-scale context using multiple convolutions with different dilation rates. In this way, it acquires an intrinsic scale invariance IB and can learn robust feature representation for objects at various scales. Moreover, in each transformer layer, ViTAE has a convolution block parallel to the multi-head self-attention module, whose features are fused and fed into the feed-forward network. Consequently, it has the intrinsic locality IB and is able to learn local features and global dependencies collaboratively. The proposed two kinds of cells are stacked in both isotropic and multi-stage manners to formulate two families of ViTAE models, i.e., the vanilla ViTAE and ViTAEv2. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset as well as downstream tasks on the MS COCO, ADE20K, and AP10K datasets validate the superiority of our models over the baseline transformer models and concurrent works. Besides, we scale up our ViTAE model to 644M parameters and obtain the state-of-the-art classification performance, i.e., 88.5% Top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet validation set and the best 91.2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet real validation set, without using extra private data.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention implementation*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Songlin Yang, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \\citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using the concepts of control variates, variance reduction in attention mechanisms, and hardware-efficient attention designs, here are some specific details and insights:\n\n## Mathematical Formulation of Control Variates in Neural Networks\n\nControl variates in the context of neural networks, particularly in attention mechanisms, involve using a secondary, more easily computable estimator to reduce the variance of the primary estimator. This is often achieved by decomposing the attention computation into simpler components.\n\nFor example, in the work \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates\" by Zheng et al., the authors show that Random Feature Attention (RFA) can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This allows for a more efficient and stable approximation of the softmax attention mechanism. The mathematical formulation typically involves expressing the attention weights as a sum of control variates, each of which can be computed more efficiently than the exact softmax attention.\n\n## Implementation Details of Variance Reduction Techniques in Attention Mechanisms\n\nVariance reduction techniques in attention mechanisms often involve approximating the softmax function or using alternative attention mechanisms that are more computationally efficient.\n\n- **Random Feature Attention (RFA):** This method uses random feature maps to approximate the softmax attention. By using control variates, RFA can be made more accurate and stable.\n- **Linear Attention:** This approach replaces the softmax function with linear transformations, which can be more efficient and scalable. Techniques like CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention) combine local and global processing to maintain efficiency while preserving model capacity.\n\n## Practical Examples of Hardware-Efficient Attention Designs\n\nHardware-efficient attention designs are crucial for scaling up language models.\n\n- **Block-Sparse Patterns:** Implementing attention mechanisms using block-sparse patterns can significantly reduce computational overhead. This involves dividing the input sequence into blocks and applying different attention mechanisms within and between blocks. For example, Lightning Attention-2 uses tiling to handle intra-block and inter-block components separately, which improves efficiency.\n- **Mixed Local-Global Processing:** CHELA is another example that combines short-long convolutions with hardware-efficient linear attention. This approach allows for global abstraction and data-dependent selection, maintaining real linear complexity while being hardware-friendly.\n- **Hardware-Aware Transformers:** Models like HAT (Hardware-Aware Transformers) are designed with hardware constraints in mind. They optimize the transformer architecture for efficient computation on specific hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, by adjusting parameters like sequence length and attention head count.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different Attention Variants\n\nPerformance comparisons typically involve evaluating metrics such as computational efficiency, memory usage, and model accuracy.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Linear attention and RFA generally offer better computational efficiency compared to traditional softmax attention, especially for long sequences. CHELA and Lightning Attention-2 have been shown to maintain or even improve model performance while reducing computational costs.\n- **Memory Usage:** Block-sparse patterns and tiling strategies can reduce memory usage by avoiding the need to compute attention weights for the entire sequence at once.\n- **Model Accuracy:** While efficient attention mechanisms may introduce some approximation errors, they often maintain or slightly degrade model accuracy compared to exact softmax attention. However, the trade-off in efficiency usually outweighs the minor loss in accuracy.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage control variates, variance reduction, and hardware-efficient designs to achieve better overall performance.\n",

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/74 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) is also based on Linear Attention and very similar to H3, but reduces the inner S4 layer to a special case where the state dimension is $N=1$. Although not framed as such, its recurrence can be viewed as a special case of a linear SSM. Its primary source of improvement is using a linear attention with large head dimension, which can be viewed as another method to perform input-dependent state expansion. Using a larger head dimension in the context of linear attention variants was first done by H 3 , but not extensively used since this requires a proportional amount of extra computation. RetNet avoids this with an alternate way to parallelize the computation with a variant of standard multi-head attention instead of convolutions, made feasible by their particular special case of SSMs which acts as a simple EMA.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B.

Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

[^0]\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer $\\left[\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}\\right.$17] has become the de facto architecture for large language models $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+} 20\\right]$, which was initially proposed to overcome the sequential training issue of recurrent models [HS97]. However, training parallelism of Transformers is at the cost of inefficient inference, because of the $O(N)$ complexity per step and memory-bound key-value cache [Sha19], which renders Transformers unfriendly to deployment. The growing sequence length increases GPU memory consumption as well as latency and reduces inference speed. Numerous efforts have continued to develop the next-generation architecture, aiming at retaining training parallelism and competitive performance as Transformers while having efficient $O(1)$ inference. It is challenging to achieve the above goals simultaneously, i.e., the so-called \"impossible triangle\" as shown in Figure 2. There have been three main strands of research. First, linearized attention [KVPF20] approximates standard attention scores $\\exp (\\boldsymbol{q} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k})$ with kernels $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q}) \\cdot \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, so that autoregressive inference can be rewritten in a recurrent form. However, the modeling capability and performance are worse than Transformers, which hinders the method's popularity. The second strand returns to recurrent models for efficient inference while sacrificing training parallelism. As a remedy, element-wise operators $\\left[\\mathrm{PAA}^{+} 23\\right]$ are used for acceleration, however, representation capacity and performance are harmed. The third line of research explores replacing attention with other mechanisms, such as S 4 [GGR21], and its variants [DFS ${ }^{+}$22, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23]. None of the previous work can break through the impossible triangle, resulting in no clear winner compared with Transformers. In this work, we propose retentive networks (RetNet), achieving low-cost inference, efficient longsequence modeling, Transformer-comparable performance, and parallel model training simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a multi-scale retention mechanism to substitute multi-head attention, which has three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent representations. First, the parallel representation empowers training parallelism to utilize GPU devices fully. Second, the recurrent representation enables efficient $O(1)$ inference in terms of memory and computation. The deployment cost and latency can be significantly reduced. Moreover, the implementation is greatly simplified without key-value cache tricks. Third, the chunkwise recurrent representation can perform efficient long-sequence modeling. We parallelly encode each local block for computation speed while recurrently encoding the global blocks to save GPU memory. We conduct extensive experiments to compare RetNet with Transformer and its variants. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet is consistently competitive in terms of both scaling curves and in-context learning. Moreover, the inference cost of RetNet is length-invariant. For a 7B model and 8 k sequence length, RetNet decodes $8.4 \\times$ faster and saves $70 \\%$ of memory than Transformers with key-value caches. During training, RetNet also achieves 25-50\\% memory saving and $7 \\times$ acceleration than standard Transformer and an advantage towards highly-optimized FlashAttention $\\left[\\mathrm{DFE}^{+}\\right.$22]. Besides, RetNet's inference latency is insensitive to batch size, allowing enormous throughput. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. ## 2 Retentive Networks\n\nRetentive network (RetNet) is stacked with $L$ identical blocks, which follows a similar layout (i.e., residual connection, and pre-LayerNorm) as in Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17]. Each RetNet block contains two modules: a multi-scale retention (MSR) module, and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. We introduce the MSR module in the following sections. Given an input sequence $x=x_{1} \\cdots x_{|x|}$, RetNet encodes the sequence in an autoregressive way. The input vectors $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{|x|}$ is first packed into $X^{0}=\\left[\\boldsymbol{x}_{1}, \\cdots, \\boldsymbol{x}_{|x|}\\right] \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, where $d_{\\text {model }}$ is hidden dimension. Then we compute contextualized vector representations $X^{l}=\\operatorname{RetNet}_{l}\\left(X^{l-1}\\right), l \\in[1, L]$. ### 2.1 Retention\n\nIn this section, we introduce the retention mechanism that has a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. So we can train the models in a parallel way while recurrently conducting inference. Given input $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$, we project it to one-dimensional function $v(n)=X_{n} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{w}_{V}$. Consider a sequence modeling problem that maps $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ through states $s_{n}$. Let $v_{n}, o_{n}$ denote $v(n), o(n)$ for simplicity. We formulate the mapping in a recurrent manner:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lr}\ns_{n}=A s_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} v_{n}, & A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}, K_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d} \\\\\no_{n}=Q_{n} s_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n} A^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m}, & Q_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere we map $v_{n}$ to the state vector $s_{n}$, and then implement a linear transform to encode sequence information recurrently. Next, we make the projection $Q_{n}, K_{n}$ content-aware:\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{Q}, W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable matrices. We diagonalize the matrix $A=\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right) \\Lambda^{-1}$, where $\\gamma, \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. Then we obtain $A^{n-m}=$ $\\Lambda\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} \\Lambda^{-1}$. By absorbing $\\Lambda$ into $W_{Q}$ and $W_{K}$, we can rewrite Equation (1) as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\no_{n} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{n} Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n-m} K_{m}^{\\top} v_{m} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{n}\\left(Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}\\right)\\left(K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}\\right)^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} v_{m}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q_{n}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{n}, K_{m}\\left(\\gamma e^{i \\theta}\\right)^{-m}$ is known as xPos [SDP ${ }^{+}$22], i.e., a relative position embedding proposed for Transformer. We further simplify $\\gamma$ as a scalar, Equation (3) becomes:\n\n$$\no_{n}=\\sum_{m=1}^{n} \\gamma^{n-m}\\left(Q_{n} e^{i n \\theta}\\right)\\left(K_{m} e^{i m \\theta}\\right)^{\\dagger} v_{m}\n$$\n\nwhere ${ }^{\\dagger}$ is the conjugate transpose. The formulation is easily parallelizable within training instances. In summary, we start with recurrent modeling as shown in Equation (1), and then derive its parallel formulation in Equation (4). We consider the original mapping $v(n) \\mapsto o(n)$ as vectors and obtain the retention mechanism as follows. The Parallel Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3a, the retention layer is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nQ=\\left(X W_{Q}\\right) \\odot \\Theta, \\quad K=\\left(X W_{K}\\right) \\odot \\bar{\\Theta}, \\quad V=X W_{V} \\\\\n\\Theta_{n}=e^{i n \\theta}, \\quad D_{n m}= \\begin{cases}\\gamma^{n-m}, & n \\geq m \\\\\n0, & n<m\\end{cases}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Retention}(X)=\\left(Q K^{\\boldsymbol{\\top}} \\odot D\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{\\Theta}$ is the complex conjugate of $\\Theta$, and $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|x| \\times|x|}$ combines causal masking and exponential decay along relative distance as one matrix. Similar to self-attention, the parallel representation enables us to train the models with GPUs efficiently. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fb33982bc7545f33a227g-04.jpg?height=520&width=1245&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=526)\n\nFigure 3: Dual form of RetNet. \"GN\" is short for GroupNorm. The Recurrent Representation of Retention As shown in Figure 3b, the proposed mechanism can also be written as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which is favorable for inference. For the $n$-th timestep, we recurrently obtain the output as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S_{n}=\\gamma S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\\top} V_{n} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{n}\\right)=Q_{n} S_{n}, \\quad n=1, \\cdots,|x|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K, V, \\gamma$ are the same as in Equation (5). The Chunkwise Recurrent Representation of Retention A hybrid form of parallel representation and recurrent representation is available to accelerate training, especially for long sequences. We divide the input sequences into chunks. Within each chunk, we follow the parallel representation (Equation (5)) to conduct computation. In contrast, cross-chunk information is passed following the recurrent representation (Equation (6)). Specifically, let $B$ denote the chunk length. We compute the retention output of the $i$-th chunk via:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Q_{[i]}=Q_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad K_{[i]}=K_{B i: B(i+1)}, \\quad V_{[i]}=V_{B i: B(i+1)} \\\\\n& R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\\top}\\left(V_{[i]} \\odot \\zeta\\right)+\\gamma^{B} R_{i-1}, \\quad \\zeta_{i j}=\\gamma^{B-i-1} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X_{[i]}\\right)= \\underbrace{\\left.Q_{[i]} K_{[i]}^{\\top} \\odot D\\right) V_{[i]}}_{\\text {Inner-Chunk }}+\\underbrace{\\left(Q_{[i]} R_{i-1}\\right) \\odot \\xi}_{\\text {Cross-Chunk }}, \\quad \\xi_{i j}=\\gamma^{i+1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $[i]$ indicates the $i$-th chunk, i.e., $x_{[i]}=\\left[x_{(i-1) B+1}, \\cdots, x_{i B}\\right]$. ### 2.2 Gated Multi-Scale Retention\n\nWe use $h=d_{\\text {model }} / d$ retention heads in each layer, where $d$ is the head dimension. The heads use different parameter matrices $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$. Moreover, multi-scale retention (MSR) assigns different $\\gamma$ for each head. For simplicity, we set $\\gamma$ identical among different layers and keep them fixed. In addition, we add a swish gate [HG16, RZL17] to increase the non-linearity of retention layers. Formally, given input $X$, we define the layer as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\gamma=1-2^{-5-\\operatorname{arange}(0, h)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{h} \\\\\n& \\operatorname{head}_{i}=\\operatorname{Retention}\\left(X, \\gamma_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& Y=\\operatorname{GroupNorm}_{h}\\left(\\operatorname{Concat}\\left(\\operatorname{head}_{1}, \\cdots, \\text { head }_{h}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\operatorname{MSR}(X)=\\left(\\operatorname{swish}\\left(X W_{G}\\right) \\odot Y\\right) W_{O}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{G}, W_{O} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ are learnable parameters, and GroupNorm [WH18] normalizes the output of each head, following SubLN proposed in [SPP ${ }^{+}$19].\n```\n\n#### 4.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

In IMP, a multi-component engineering system is subject to a risk of failure due to its components' damage condition. Specifically, each agent plans inspections and repairs for a specific system component, aiming to minimise maintenance costs while cooperating to minimise system failure risk. With IMP-MARL, we release several environments including one related to offshore wind structural systems, in an effort to meet today's needs to improve management strategies to support sustainable and reliable energy systems. Supported by IMP practical engineering environments featuring up to 100 agents, we conduct a benchmark campaign, where the scalability and performance of state-of-the-art cooperative MARL methods are compared against expert-based heuristic policies. The results reveal that centralised training with decentralised execution methods scale better with the number of agents than fully centralised or decentralised RL approaches, while also outperforming expert-based heuristic policies in most IMP environments. Based on our findings, we additionally outline remaining cooperation and scalability challenges that future MARL methods should still address. Through IMP-MARL, we encourage the implementation of new environments and the further development of MARL methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Mean-Field Game Approach to Cloud Resource Management with Function Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: RetNet state management*\n\n*Weichao Mao, Haoran Qiu, Chen Wang, H. Franke, Z.

Ba\u015far*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents an online natural actor-critic algorithm for learning in MFGs compatible with various forms of function approximation and theoretically establishes its finite-time convergence to the regularized Nash equilibrium under linear function approximation and softmax parameterization.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained increasing popularity for resource management in cloud services such as serverless computing. As self-interested users compete for shared resources in a cluster, the multi-tenancy nature of serverless platforms necessitates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) solutions, which often suffer from severe scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a mean-field game (MFG) approach to cloud resource management that is scalable to a large number of users and applications and incorporates function approximation to deal with the large state-action spaces in real-world serverless platforms. Specifically, we present an online natural actor-critic algorithm for learning in MFGs compatible with various forms of function approximation. We theoretically establish its finite-time convergence to the regularized Nash equilibrium under linear function approximation and softmax parameterization. We further implement our algorithm using both linear and neural-network function approximations, and evaluate our solution on an open-source serverless platform, OpenWhisk, with real-world work-loads from production traces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach is scalable to a large number of users and significantly outperforms various baselines in terms of function latency and resource utilization efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

Cevher, Mahsa Shoaran*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection, and achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Abstract:** EEG-based seizure detection models face challenges in terms of inference speed and memory efficiency, limiting their real-time implementation in clinical devices. This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection. By leveraging a combination of graph neural networks and recurrent structures, REST efficiently captures both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies within EEG data. Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task. These attributes position REST as a promising candidate for real-time implementation in clinical devices, such as Responsive Neurostimulation or seizure alert systems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Communication-Efficient Gradient Descent-Accent Methods for Distributed Variational Inequalities: Unified Analysis and Local Updates\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state updates*\n\n*Siqi Zhang, S.

However, with the increase of minimax optimization and variational inequality problems in machine learning, the necessity of designing efficient distributed/federated learning approaches for these problems is becoming more apparent. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis of communication-efficient local training methods for distributed variational inequality problems (VIPs). Our approach is based on a general key assumption on the stochastic estimates that allows us to propose and analyze several novel local training algorithms under a single framework for solving a class of structured non-monotone VIPs. We present the first local gradient descent-accent algorithms with provable improved communication complexity for solving distributed variational inequalities on heterogeneous data. The general algorithmic framework recovers state-of-the-art algorithms and their sharp convergence guarantees when the setting is specialized to minimization or minimax optimization problems. Finally, we demonstrate the strong performance of the proposed algorithms compared to state-of-the-art methods when solving federated minimax optimization problems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Diable: Efficient Dialogue State Tracking as Operations on Tables\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state updates*\n\n*Pietro Lesci, Yoshinari Fujinuma, Momchil Hardalov, Chao Shang, L. M\u00e0rquez*\n\n**TL;DR:** Diable is proposed, a new task formalisation that simplifies the design and implementation of efficient DST systems and allows one to easily plug and play large language models and robust to noisy data annotations due to the table operations approach.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence-to-sequence state-of-the-art systems for dialogue state tracking (DST) use the full dialogue history as input, represent the current state as a list with all the slots, and generate the entire state from scratch at each dialogue turn. This approach is inefficient, especially when the number of slots is large and the conversation is long. We propose Diable, a new task formalisation that simplifies the design and implementation of efficient DST systems and allows one to easily plug and play large language models. We represent the dialogue state as a table and formalise DST as a table manipulation task. At each turn, the system updates the previous state by generating table operations based on the dialogue context. Extensive experimentation on the MultiWoz datasets demonstrates that Diable (i) outperforms strong efficient DST baselines, (ii) is 2.4x more time efficient than current state-of-the-art methods while retaining competitive Joint Goal Accuracy, and (iii) is robust to noisy data annotations due to the table operations approach.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient RetNet*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient RetNet*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs.

RollingLDA: An Update Algorithm of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to Construct Consistent Time Series from Textual Data\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state updates*\n\n*J\u00f6rg Rahnenf\u00fchrer, Carsten Jentsch, Jonas Rieger*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a rolling version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation, called RollingLDA. By a sequential approach, it enables the construction of LDA-based time series of topics that are consistent with previous states of LDA models. After an initial modeling, updates can be computed efficiently, allowing for real-time monitoring and detection of events or structural breaks. For this purpose, we propose suitable similarity measures for topics and provide simulation evidence of superiority over other commonly used approaches. The adequacy of the resulting method is illustrated by an application to an example corpus. In particular, we compute the similarity of sequentially obtained topic and word distributions over consecutive time periods. For a representative example corpus consisting of The New York Times articles from 1980 to 2020, we analyze the effect of several tuning parameter choices and we run the RollingLDA method on the full dataset of approximately 4 million articles to demonstrate its feasibility.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** None\n\n\n\n#### 2. Killing Two Birds with One Stone:Efficient and Robust Training of Face Recognition CNNs by Partial FC\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state updates*\n\n*Tongliang Liu, Jing Yang, Xuhan Zhu, Ziyong Feng, Jia Guo, Jiankang Deng, Xiang An*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning discriminative deep feature embeddings by using million-scale in-the-wild datasets and margin-based softmax loss is the current state-of-the-art approach for face recognition. However, the memory and computing cost of the Fully Connected (FC) layer linearly scales up to the number of identities in the training set. Besides, the large-scale training data inevitably suffers from inter-class conflict and long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparsely updating variant of the FC layer, named Partial FC (PFC). In each iteration, positive class centers and a random subset of negative class centers are selected to compute the margin-based softmax loss. All class centers are still maintained throughout the whole training process, but only a subset is selected and updated in each iteration. Therefore, the computing requirement, the probability of inter-class conflict, and the frequency of passive update on tail class centers, are dramatically reduced. Extensive experiments across different training data and backbones (e.g. CNN and ViT) confirm the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed PFC.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient RetNet*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, such as RetNet, focusing on state management, efficient state updates, and hardware optimization, here are some key points and strategies derived from the analysis and relevant literature:\n\n## State Management Techniques in RetNet and Similar Architectures\n\n### Control Variate-Based Attention Optimization\nControl variates can be used to improve attention mechanisms in RetNet-like architectures. By decomposing the attention computation into multiple control variate estimators, it is possible to reduce variance and maintain linear complexity. This approach, as discussed in \"Efficient Attention via Control Variates,\" can stabilize training and improve inference efficiency.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nUsing block-sparse patterns and tiling strategies, as seen in \"Lightning Attention-2,\" can efficiently handle intra-block and inter-block components in attention calculations. This method separates the attention computation into different scales, utilizing conventional attention for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks, which can enhance efficiency.\n\n### Mixed Local-Global Processing\nCombining local and global processing through techniques like short-long convolutions (as in \"Short-Long Convolutions\") can provide efficient attention alternatives. This approach replaces self-attention mechanisms with short-long convolutions, implementing linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, which maintains global abstraction and data-dependent selection while keeping real linear complexity.\n\n## Efficient Methods for Updating and Maintaining State Information\n\n### Variance Reduction Techniques\nUsing control variates to reduce variance in attention computation can improve both training stability and inference efficiency. This technique can be combined with other efficiency methods to enhance overall performance.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\nImplementing linear attention in a hardware-efficient manner, such as through CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), can replace traditional self-attention mechanisms with more efficient alternatives. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for RetNet-Like Architectures\n\n### Block-Sparse Patterns\nUtilizing block-sparse patterns in the design of RetNet-like models can significantly improve hardware efficiency. This involves structuring the model's weights and computations to leverage sparse matrix operations, which can reduce memory usage and computational overhead.\n\n### Tiling and Mixed Processing\nTiling strategies, as mentioned in \"Lightning Attention-2,\" can be used to handle different components of the attention mechanism separately. This approach can optimize the use of hardware resources by applying different attention mechanisms for intra-block and inter-block computations.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different State Update Mechanisms\n\n### Comparative Studies\nComparative studies between different state update mechanisms, such as those using control variates, block-sparse patterns, and mixed local-global processing, can provide insights into their relative efficiencies. For instance, \"Short-Long Convolutions\" and \"Lightning Attention-2\" demonstrate that these novel approaches can outperform traditional methods in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n### Experimental Results\nExperimental results from studies like those mentioned in the analysis show that these novel methods can achieve state-of-the-art performance while being more compact and efficient. For example, the model in \"Short-Long Convolutions\" achieves high performance in object recognition and depth estimation tasks while maintaining an inference speed of 70 frames per second on an NVIDIA 4060 GPU.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that maintain high performance while optimizing for hardware efficiency and state management.\n",

We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/59 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nData Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pages 1-29, 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/ s10618-021-00745-9.

HiPPO The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory 24] and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) 58. The HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture. A successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT [12] keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations. First, the state matrix $A$ and discretization timescale $\\Delta t$ cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which $A$ matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations. Second, (1) is a 1-D to $N$-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D. This creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\n```\n\n#### 2.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n#### 5.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form. At last, we highlight future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/22 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nMiller, J. and Hardt, M.

Specially, consider a random walk on a regular Markov chain and a Hermitian matrix-valued function on its state space. Our result gives exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of the extreme eigenvalues of the sample mean matrix. Our proof is based on the matrix expander (regular undirected graph) Chernoff bound [Garg et al. STOC \u201918] and scalar Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for Markov chains [Chung et al. STACS \u201912]. Our matrix Chernoff bound for Markov chains can be applied to analyze the behavior of co-occurrence statistics for sequential data, which have been common and important data signals in machine learning. We show that given a regular Markov chain with \\(n\\) states and mixing time \\(\\tau\\), we need a trajectory of length \\(O(\\tau (\\log{n} + \\log{\\tau})/\\epsilon^2)\\) to achieve an estimator of the co-occurrence matrix with error bound \\(\\epsilon\\).

DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic recurrence*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Unfortunately, the immense amount of computations and memory accesses required for LLM training makes them prohibitively expensive in terms of hardware cost, and thus challenging to deploy in use cases such as on-device learning. In this paper, motivated by the observation that LLM training is memory-bound, we propose a novel dynamic quantization strategy, termed Dynamic Stashing Quantization (DSQ), that puts a special focus on reducing the memory operations, but also enjoys the other benefits of low precision training, such as the reduced arithmetic cost. We conduct a thorough study on two translation tasks (trained-from-scratch) and three classification tasks (fine-tuning). DSQ reduces the amount of arithmetic operations by $20.95\\times$ and the number of DRAM operations by $2.55\\times$ on IWSLT17 compared to the standard 16-bit fixed-point, which is widely used in on-device learning.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6.

We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences.

However, constructing global or local transition graphs to supplement session data can lead to noisy correlations and user intent vanishing. In this work, we propose the Frequent Attribute Pattern Augmented Transformer (FAPAT) that characterizes user intents by building attribute transition graphs and matching attribute patterns. Specifically, the frequent and compact attribute patterns are served as memory to augment session representations, followed by a gate and a transformer block to fuse the whole session information. Through extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and 100 million industrial data in three domains, we demonstrate that FAPAT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 4.5% across various evaluation metrics (Hits, NDCG, MRR). Besides evaluating the next-item prediction, we estimate the models' capabilities to capture user intents via predicting items' attributes and period-item recommendations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. GroupReduce: Block-Wise Low-Rank Approximation for Neural Language Model Shrinking\n\n*From Search Query: block based state processing*\n\n*Patrick H. Chen, Si Si, Yang Li, Ciprian Chelba, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** GroupReduce is proposed, a novel compression method for neural language models, based on vocabulary-partition based low-rank matrix approximation and the inherent frequency distribution of tokens (the power-law distribution of words).\n\n**Abstract:** Model compression is essential for serving large deep neural nets on devices with limited resources or applications that require real-time responses. As a case study, a state-of-the-art neural language model usually consists of one or more recurrent layers sandwiched between an embedding layer used for representing input tokens and a softmax layer for generating output tokens. For problems with a very large vocabulary size, the embedding and the softmax matrices can account for more than half of the model size. For instance, the bigLSTM model achieves state-of- the-art performance on the One-Billion-Word (OBW) dataset with around 800k vocabulary, and its word embedding and softmax matrices use more than 6GBytes space, and are responsible for over 90% of the model parameters. In this paper, we propose GroupReduce, a novel compression method for neural language models, based on vocabulary-partition (block) based low-rank matrix approximation and the inherent frequency distribution of tokens (the power-law distribution of words). The experimental results show our method can significantly outperform traditional compression methods such as low-rank approximation and pruning. On the OBW dataset, our method achieved 6.6 times compression rate for the embedding and softmax matrices, and when combined with quantization, our method can achieve 26 times compression rate, which translates to a factor of 12.8 times compression for the entire model with very little degradation in perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 62  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FastGRNN: A Fast, Accurate, Stable and Tiny Kilobyte Sized Gated Recurrent Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: matrix valued states RNN*\n\n*Kush Bhatia, Manish Singh, Manik Varma, Prateek Jain, Ashish Kumar, Aditya Kusupati*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper develops the FastRNN and FastGRNN algorithms to address the twin\nRNN limitations of inaccurate training and inefficient prediction. Previous\napproaches have improved accuracy at the expense of prediction costs making\nthem infeasible for resource-constrained and real-time applications. Unitary\nRNNs have increased accuracy somewhat by restricting the range of the state\ntransition matrix's singular values but have also increased the model size as\nthey require a larger number of hidden units to make up for the loss in\nexpressive power. Gated RNNs have obtained state-of-the-art accuracies by\nadding extra parameters thereby resulting in even larger models. FastRNN\naddresses these limitations by adding a residual connection that does not\nconstrain the range of the singular values explicitly and has only two extra\nscalar parameters. FastGRNN then extends the residual connection to a gate by\nreusing the RNN matrices to match state-of-the-art gated RNN accuracies but\nwith a 2-4x smaller model. Enforcing FastGRNN's matrices to be low-rank, sparse\nand quantized resulted in accurate models that could be up to 35x smaller than\nleading gated and unitary RNNs. This allowed FastGRNN to accurately recognize\nthe \"Hey Cortana\" wakeword with a 1 KB model and to be deployed on severely\nresource-constrained IoT microcontrollers too tiny to store other RNN models.\nFastGRNN's code is available at https://github.com/Microsoft/EdgeML/.\n\n**Conference:** fastgrnn-a-fast-accurate-stable-and-tiny-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: matrix valued states RNN*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Wave Physics as an Analog Recurrent Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic recurrence*\n\n*Momchil Minkov, Shanhui Fan, Tyler W. Hughes, Ian A. D. Williamson*\n\n**Abstract:** Analog machine learning hardware platforms promise to be faster and more energy-efficient than their digital counterparts. Wave physics, as found in acoustics and optics, is a natural candidate for building analog processors for time-varying signals. Here we identify a mapping between the dynamics of wave physics, and the computation in recurrent neural networks. This mapping indicates that physical wave systems can be trained to learn complex features in temporal data, using standard training techniques for neural networks. As a demonstration, we show that an inverse-designed inhomogeneous medium can perform vowel classification on raw audio signals as their waveforms scatter and propagate through it, achieving performance comparable to a standard digital implementation of a recurrent neural network. These findings pave the way for a new class of analog machine learning platforms, capable of fast and efficient processing of information in its native domain.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-29\n\n\n\n#### 4. Legendre Memory Units: Continuous-Time Representation in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient dynamic recurrence*\n\n*Ivana Kaji\u0107, Chris Eliasmith, Aaron Voelker*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel memory cell for recurrent neural networks that dynamically maintains information across long windows of time using relatively few resources. The Legendre Memory Unit~(LMU) is mathematically derived to orthogonalize its continuous-time history -- doing so by solving $d$ coupled ordinary differential equations~(ODEs), whose phase space linearly maps onto sliding windows of time via the Legendre polynomials up to degree $d - 1$. Backpropagation across LMUs outperforms equivalently-sized LSTMs on a chaotic time-series prediction task, improves memory capacity by two orders of magnitude, and significantly reduces training and inference times. LMUs can efficiently handle temporal dependencies spanning $100\\text{,}000$ time-steps, converge rapidly, and use few internal state-variables to learn complex functions spanning long windows of time -- exceeding state-of-the-art performance among RNNs on permuted sequential MNIST. These results are due to the network's disposition to learn scale-invariant features independently of step size. Backpropagation through the ODE solver allows each layer to adapt its internal time-step, enabling the network to learn task-relevant time-scales. We demonstrate that LMU memory cells can be implemented using $m$ recurrently-connected Poisson spiking neurons, $\\mathcal{O}( m )$ time and memory, with error scaling as $\\mathcal{O}( d / \\sqrt{m} )$. We discuss implementations of LMUs on analog and digital neuromorphic hardware.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5.

DrJAX leverages JAX's sharding mechanisms to enable native targeting of TPUs and state-of-the-art JAX runtimes, including Pathways. DrJAX embeds building blocks for MapReduce computations as primitives in JAX. This enables three key benefits. First, DrJAX computations can be translated directly to XLA HLO, enabling flexible integration with a wide array of ML training platforms. Second, DrJAX computations are fully differentiable. Last, DrJAX computations can be interpreted out to existing batch-processing compute systems, including traditional MapReduce systems like Apache Beam and cross-device compute systems like those powering federated learning applications. We show that DrJAX provides an easily programmable, performant, and scalable framework for parallelized algorithm development.

Charformer: Fast Character Transformers via Gradient-based Subword Tokenization\n\n*From Search Query: block based state processing*\n\n*Donald Metzler, Cong Yu, Simon Baumgartner, Zhen Qin, Dara Bahri, Hyung Won Chung, Jai Gupta, Sebastian Ruder, Vinh Q. Tran, Yi Tay*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art models in natural language processing rely on separate rigid subword tokenization algorithms, which limit their generalization ability and adaptation to new settings. In this paper, we propose a new model inductive bias that learns a subword tokenization end-to-end as part of the model. To this end, we introduce a soft gradient-based subword tokenization module (GBST) that automatically learns latent subword representations from characters in a data-driven fashion. Concretely, GBST enumerates candidate subword blocks and learns to score them in a position-wise fashion using a block scoring network. We additionally introduce Charformer, a deep Transformer model that integrates GBST and operates on the byte level. Via extensive experiments on English GLUE, multilingual, and noisy text datasets, we show that Charformer outperforms a series of competitive byte-level baselines while generally performing on par and sometimes outperforming subword-based models. Additionally, Charformer is fast, improving the speed of both vanilla byte-level and subword-level Transformers by 28%-100% while maintaining competitive quality. We believe this work paves the way for highly performant token-free models that are trained completely end-to-end.\n\n**Conference:** charformer-fast-character-transformers-via-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on matrix-valued states, hardware-efficient dynamic recurrence, block-based state processing, and stability analysis, here are some key insights and techniques derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Implementation Techniques for Matrix-Valued States in RNNs\n\n- **Matrix-Valued States**: Recent work such as the Eagle and Finch models introduces multi-headed matrix-valued states, which can capture richer representations compared to scalar states. This approach involves using matrices instead of vectors for the hidden states, allowing for more complex interactions and better expressivity.\n- **Minimal RNNs**: The concept of minimal GRUs and LSTMs (minGRU and minLSTM) involves simplifying the traditional RNN architectures to remove dependencies on previous hidden states, making them more amenable to parallel processing. This could be a stepping stone for incorporating matrix-valued states, as it simplifies the state recurrence and makes it more efficient.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Methods for Dynamic State Updates\n\n- **Block-Sparse Patterns and Tiling Strategies**: To improve hardware efficiency, using block-sparse patterns and tiling strategies can enhance memory access patterns and parallel computation. This involves dividing the computation into smaller blocks that can be processed efficiently, reducing the overall computational and memory requirements.\n- **Parallel Scan Algorithm**: The use of the parallel scan algorithm for training RNNs, as described in the minimal RNNs work, can significantly improve the efficiency of state updates. By removing the dependencies on previous hidden states, these models can be trained in parallel, which is more hardware-friendly.\n\n### Block-Based Processing and Tiling Strategies for State Management\n\n- **Chunkwise Processing**: The dual parallel/recurrent algorithms and the 'chunkwise' mode proposed in models like RetNet and TransNormerLLM can be optimized using block-based processing. This involves processing the sequence in chunks rather than sequentially, which can improve parallelism and reduce memory usage.\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Tiling strategies can be applied to divide the state updates into smaller, more manageable blocks. This approach can optimize memory access patterns and improve the efficiency of parallel computation, making it suitable for hardware-aware implementations.\n\n### Stability Analysis of Enhanced Recurrent Architectures\n\n- **Stability in Minimal RNNs**: The minimal versions of GRUs and LSTMs (minGRU and minLSTM) ensure stability by removing the output gate and normalizing the gates to make the hidden state time-independent in scale. This simplification helps in maintaining stability while improving computational efficiency.\n- **Control Variate Methods**: To maintain stability and reduce variance, control variate methods can be employed. These methods help in stabilizing the training process by reducing the variance of the gradients, which is crucial for maintaining the stability of enhanced recurrent architectures[Analysis Note].\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Dynamic Recurrence Mechanism**: The dynamic recurrence mechanism, as seen in models like Eagle and Finch, adapts the state updates based on the input content. This can enhance expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency, which is a key requirement for improving autoregressive language models.\n- **State Space Model Lens**: Viewing the model through the state space model lens, as suggested by the work on Transformers as SSMs, can provide insights into how to maintain stability and efficiency. This involves ensuring that the state updates are structured in a way that maintains the dual parallel/recurrent form efficiently.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, the researcher can improve the expressivity and efficiency of the autoregressive language model, ensuring better performance, stability, and hardware efficiency.\n",

Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nPeng, B., Goldstein, D., Anthony, Q., Albalak, A., Alcaide, E., Biderman, S., Cheah, E., Du, X., Ferdinan, T., Hou, H., Kazienko, P., GV, K.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 48/48 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n## I see.

If five cats can catch five mice in five minutes, it means that each cat can catch one mouse in one minute. To find out how long it will take one cat to catch one mouse, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's assume that it takes x minutes for a cat to catch a mouse. Then, the number of mice caught by a cat in one minute is equal to the number of cats multiplied by the number of mice caught by each cat: $x=5 * 1=5$\nSo, it will take 5 minutes for one cat to catch one mouse. ## RWKV-4-Raven-14B\n\nSummarize the following paragraph. <The Abstract of this paper goes here>\nThe paper presents a novel architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/63 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn C. Zong, F. Xia, W. Li, and R.

Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019. ## A Instantiations of General Framework in SSM Models\n\nHere, we survey how (1) is instantiated in a range of SSMs. As stated in Section 2, we refer to SSMs where the gate $A$ does not depend on $x_{t}$ as time-invariant. An equivalent terminology is the distinction between \"Weak Linear Time Invariant Convolutional Models\" (i.e., time-invariant) and \"Linear Time Variant Models\" (i.e., non-time-invariant) in Aky\u00fcrek et al. [1]. ## A. 1 Non-Time-Invariant Models\n\nApproximately simultaneously with or more recently than [23], a range of non-time-invariant SSMs have been introduced [14, 72, 57, 56]. This category also covers highly similar earlier RNN variants [8, 41]. Mamba In Mamba, (2) and (3) directly map onto Eqs. (2a) and (2b) in Gu and Dao [23]. The notation of Gu and Dao [23] use a matrix multiplication $\\bar{A} h_{t-1}$ instead of elementwise multiplication $A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}$ in (REF), but importantly, Mamba's $\\bar{A}$ is diagonal, so we can take $A\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{i}=\\bar{A}_{i i}$. Due to exponential parameterization, its entries are nonnegative. Griffin The RG-LRU layer of Griffin [14] uses the equation\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\underbrace{a_{t}}_{A\\left(x_{t}\\right)} \\circ h_{t-1}+\\underbrace{\\sqrt{1-a_{t}^{2}} \\circ\\left(i_{t} \\circ x_{t}\\right)}_{B\\left(x_{t}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{t}, i_{t}$ are neurally parameterized in terms of $x_{t}$ but not $h_{<t}$; by design, $a_{t} \\in(0,1) . \\phi$ is instantiated in terms of linear transformations, GeLU, and RMSNorm (Figure 2 in De et al. [14]). The local attention used by Griffin can be subsumed into an SSM layer (Remark 18.)\n\nGated Linear Attention [GLA 72] This model (Section 4.4 in Yang et al. [72]) instantiates our framework using a recurrence of the form (1); while the state is two-dimensional in this model, the update is performed by elementwise products as in (1). The gate is obtained by applying sigmoid to a linear transformation of $x_{t}$; thus, its entries are in $(0,1) . \\phi$ is instantiated in terms of SwiGLU and LayerNorm. HGRN HGRN [57] and HGRN2 [56] are defined by a recurrence of the form (1]; the gate entries are $\\in(0,1)$ by design. $\\phi$ is instantiated in terms of GLU, linear transformations, and normalization. In HGRN, the state is complex, but crucially the gate remains real-valued. ## A. 2 Time-Invariant Models\n\nTime-invariant SSMs introduced before late 2023 are surveyed by Gu and Dao [23, Appendix B], such as [47, 67, 52]. Time-invariant SSMs have often used complex-valued states and gates; this does not have a major impact on our results: First, as complex-valued SSMs subsume real-valued ones, our positive results carry over. Second, our negative result about PARITY is affected by this distinction and requires a separate argument, see Theorem 13\nNote also that $A h_{t-1}$ is often described as a general matrix multiplication, but $A$ is diagonalizable (e.g. Lemma 3.2 in Gu et al. [24]; [67] for RetNet), which \u2014even though implementation may be based on non-diagonalized representations [24]-renders the model equivalent to one where $A$ is diagonal from the start. This equivalence is shown as Lemma 3.1 in Gu et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nChung et al. 2014) as well as more modern variants such as the QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), SRU (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017), RWKV (B. Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n#### 3. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: matrix-valued states, block processing neural networks, matrix state space models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Specially, consider a random walk on a regular Markov chain and a Hermitian matrix-valued function on its state space. Our result gives exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of the extreme eigenvalues of the sample mean matrix. Our proof is based on the matrix expander (regular undirected graph) Chernoff bound [Garg et al. STOC \u201918] and scalar Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for Markov chains [Chung et al. STACS \u201912]. Our matrix Chernoff bound for Markov chains can be applied to analyze the behavior of co-occurrence statistics for sequential data, which have been common and important data signals in machine learning. We show that given a regular Markov chain with \\(n\\) states and mixing time \\(\\tau\\), we need a trajectory of length \\(O(\\tau (\\log{n} + \\log{\\tau})/\\epsilon^2)\\) to achieve an estimator of the co-occurrence matrix with error bound \\(\\epsilon\\). We conduct several experiments and the experimental results are consistent with the exponentially fast convergence rate from theoretical analysis. Our result gives the first bound on the convergence rate of the co-occurrence matrix and the first sample complexity analysis in graph representation learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3.

For problems with countably infinite states, where classical methods such as matrix exponentiation are not applicable, the main alternative has been particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods imputing both the holding times and sequences of visited states. We propose a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding times are marginalized analytically. We demonstrate that in a range of realistic inferential setups, our scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given a fixed computational budget. These experiments are performed on both synthetic and real datasets, drawing from two important examples of CTMCs having combinatorial state spaces: string-valued mutation models in phylogenetics and nucleic acid folding pathways.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Recently, people have developed theoretical results arguing that, even though the homophily principle is broken, the advantage of GNNs can still hold as long as nodes from the same class share similar neighborhood patterns [29], which questions the validity of homophily. However, this argument only considers intra-class Node Distinguishability (ND) and ignores inter-class ND, which is insuf\ufb01cient to study the effect of homophily. In this paper, we \ufb01rst demonstrate the aforementioned insuf\ufb01ciency with examples and argue that an ideal situation for ND is to have smaller intra-class ND than inter-class ND. To formulate this idea and have a better understanding of homophily, we propose Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H) and de\ufb01ne two metrics, Probabilistic Bayes Error (PBE) and Expected Negative KL-divergence (ENKL), to quantify ND, through which we can also \ufb01nd how intra- and inter-class ND in\ufb02uence ND together.

Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: block processing neural networks*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Deep Residual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: block processing neural networks*\n\n*Wei Fang, Zhaofei Yu, Yanqing Chen, Tiejun Huang, T. Masquelier, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in deep SNNs and proves that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present optimization difficulties for gradient-based approaches due to discrete binary activation and complex spatial-temporal dynamics. Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep learning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning. Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper, we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet, DVS Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, and show that SEW ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in both accuracy and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher performance by simply adding more layers, providing a simple method to train deep SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training deep SNNs with more than 100 layers becomes possible.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: matrix state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 8.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 9. How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections\n\n*From Search Query: matrix state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Towards Faster Training of Global Covariance Pooling Networks by Iterative Matrix Square Root Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*Zilin Gao, Peihua Li, Jiangtao Xie, Qilong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Global covariance pooling in convolutional neural networks has achieved\nimpressive improvement over the classical first-order pooling. Recent works\nhave shown matrix square root normalization plays a central role in achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods depend heavily on\neigendecomposition (EIG) or singular value decomposition (SVD), suffering from\ninefficient training due to limited support of EIG and SVD on GPU. Towards\naddressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root\nnormalization method for fast end-to-end training of global covariance pooling\nnetworks. At the core of our method is a meta-layer designed with loop-embedded\ndirected graph structure. The meta-layer consists of three consecutive\nnonlinear structured layers, which perform pre-normalization, coupled matrix\niteration and post-compensation, respectively. Our method is much faster than\nEIG or SVD based ones, since it involves only matrix multiplications, suitable\nfor parallel implementation on GPU. Moreover, the proposed network with ResNet\narchitecture can converge in much less epochs, further accelerating network\ntraining. On large-scale ImageNet, we achieve competitive performance superior\nto existing counterparts.

Transformer in Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: block processing neural networks*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chunjing Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Enhua Wu, An Xiao, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost.

Beyond 512 Tokens: Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder for Long-Form Document Matching\n\n*From Search Query: block processing neural networks*\n\n*Liu Yang, Michael Bendersky, Mingyang Zhang, Marc Najork, Cheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing and information retrieval problems can be formalized as the task of semantic matching. Existing work in this area has been largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question answering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval). Semantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important applications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and document clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research effort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These models, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one paragraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with respect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for long-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt self-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture sentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model with a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the masked word language modeling task used by BERT. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets for long-form document matching show that our proposed SMITH model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models including hierarchical attention, multi-depth attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network, and BERT. Comparing to BERT based baselines, our model is able to increase maximum input text length from 512 to 2048. We will open source a Wikipedia based benchmark dataset, code and a pre-trained checkpoint to accelerate future research on long-form document matching.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hydra: Bidirectional State Space Models Through Generalized Matrix Mixers\n\n*From Search Query: matrix state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Aakash Lahoti, Sukjun Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** A wide array of sequence models are built on a framework modeled after Transformers, comprising alternating sequence mixer and channel mixer layers. This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, Hydra outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: matrix state space models*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, particularly by incorporating matrix-valued states and block-based processing, here are some key points and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Matrix-Valued States\n\n- **Expressivity and Efficiency**: The use of matrix-valued states can enhance the expressivity of the model. For example, the \"Eagle and Finch\" model introduces matrix-valued states in the RWKV architecture, which improves the handling of long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n- **Existing Implementations**: Models like HGRN2 use gated linear RNNs with state expansion, including matrix-valued representations, to achieve richer dynamics and improved performance on sequence modeling tasks. This indicates that matrix-valued states can be a viable approach for enhancing model capacity.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Block-based processing is a technique that can optimize memory access patterns and computational efficiency. This method is particularly relevant for hardware-aware optimizations, which align with the goal of improving efficiency in both training and inference. The concept of block processing is similar to the parallel scan algorithm discussed in the context of RNNs, which can be efficiently trained without the need for backpropagation through time (BPTT).\n\n### State-Space Models\n\n- **Linear State-Space Layers**: Combining recurrent, convolutional, and continuous-time models with linear state-space layers can efficiently handle long sequences. This approach, as described by Gu et al., integrates different architectures and maintains linear computational complexity, which is beneficial for scalability.\n\n### Scalability and Efficiency\n\n- **Computational Complexity**: The introduction of matrix-valued states increases the space complexity to O(d\u00b2), which could impact scalability. However, models like DenseMamba, which use dense hidden connections in state space models, demonstrate that efficient designs can mitigate such issues while improving performance.\n\n### Robustness and Stability\n\n- **Controlled State Updates**: Ensuring training stability, especially with long sequences, is crucial. Techniques such as state normalization and controlled updates, similar to those used in LSTMs and GRUs, can help mitigate issues like vanishing or exploding gradients.\n\n### Alignment with Current Trends\n\n- **Retentive Networks**: The Retentive Network (RetNet) architecture, which supports parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent computation paradigms, is a relevant foundation for the proposed model. Integrating matrix-valued states and block processing into such architectures can align with current trends in scalable language model development.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **Eagle and Finch**: This work introduces matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence in the RWKV architecture, providing a basis for enhancing expressivity and efficiency.\n\n- **HGRN2**: This model uses gated linear RNNs with state expansion, including matrix-valued representations, to improve performance on sequence modeling tasks.\n\n- **Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models**: This work by Gu et al. explores linear state-space layers that integrate different architectures, offering insights into efficient handling of long sequences.\n\n- **Retentive Network**: Sun et al.'s work on Retentive Networks provides a foundation for scalable language models that can be enhanced with matrix-valued states and block processing.\n\n- **DenseMamba**: He et al.'s work on DenseMamba demonstrates how state space models with dense hidden connections can be efficient and perform well, even with increased complexity.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- **Validate Novelty**: Conduct a thorough review to ensure that the application of matrix-valued states to RetNetMLP is novel and does not overlap significantly with existing research.\n\n- **Assess Practical Implementations**: Investigate existing implementations of matrix-valued states in language models to identify potential challenges and solutions.\n\n- **Evaluate Scalability**: Analyze the impact of O(d\u00b2) complexity on large-scale models and explore optimizations to mitigate any negative effects.\n\n- **Empirical Evidence**: Seek out experimental results or benchmarks from similar models to gauge expected performance improvements and practical feasibility.\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Research current practices in hardware optimization related to block processing to substantiate the claims of improved efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and references, the researcher can develop a well-informed and innovative approach to designing a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages matrix-valued states and block-based processing.\n",

However, applying matrix-valued states specifically to **RetNetMLP** appears to be a new application.\n\n- **Block-Based Processing**: While block-based processing is a common technique for optimizing hardware efficiency in neural networks, integrating this method with matrix-valued states in the context of RetNetMLP may present a novel combination.\n\n- **Comparison with Siblings**: The sibling designs focus on hierarchical processing (**hierretnet**) and adaptive sparsity (**adaretnet**). **MatrixRetNet** differs by introducing matrix-valued states and block processing, suggesting a unique contribution.\n\n**Impact on Accuracy, Robustness, Efficiency, and Scalability**:\n\n- **Accuracy and Expressivity**: Matrix-valued states can potentially enhance the model's capacity to capture complex patterns, improving accuracy on language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Robustness**: Controlled state updates and normalization may improve training stability, leading to more robust models, especially on long sequences.\n\n- **Efficiency**: Block-based processing could optimize computational efficiency and improve hardware utilization. However, the increased computational overhead from handling matrix operations needs to be considered.\n\n- **Scalability**: The O(d\u00b2) space complexity introduced by matrix-valued states may impact scalability for models with large hidden dimensions. The proposal needs to demonstrate that computational requirements are maintained or reduced despite this increase.\n\n**Alignment with Current Research Trends**:\n\n- The proposal aligns with ongoing efforts to enhance the expressivity of neural networks through richer state representations.\n\n- Incorporating hardware-aware optimizations reflects a trend towards designing models that leverage computational resources more efficiently.\n\n- The focus on maintaining O(1) inference complexity while improving model capacity is consistent with the goals of scalable language model development.\n\n### 4.

Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/31 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nPeng, B., Goldstein, D., Anthony, Q., Albalak, A., Alcaide, E., Biderman, S., Cheah, E., Du, X., Ferdinan, T., Hou, H., Kazienko, P., GV, K.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

(2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued state space models\"*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued state space models\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4. When Do Graph Neural Networks Help with Node Classification: Investigating the Homophily Principle on Node Distinguishability\n\n*From Search Query: \"block processing neural networks\"*\n\n*Sitao Luan, Chenqing Hua, Minkai Xu, Qincheng Lu, Jiaqi Zhu, Xiaoming Chang, Jie Fu, J.

Recently, people have developed theoretical results arguing that, even though the homophily principle is broken, the advantage of GNNs can still hold as long as nodes from the same class share similar neighborhood patterns [29], which questions the validity of homophily. However, this argument only considers intra-class Node Distinguishability (ND) and ignores inter-class ND, which is insuf\ufb01cient to study the effect of homophily. In this paper, we \ufb01rst demonstrate the aforementioned insuf\ufb01ciency with examples and argue that an ideal situation for ND is to have smaller intra-class ND than inter-class ND. To formulate this idea and have a better understanding of homophily, we propose Contextual Stochastic Block Model for Homophily (CSBM-H) and de\ufb01ne two metrics, Probabilistic Bayes Error (PBE) and Expected Negative KL-divergence (ENKL), to quantify ND, through which we can also \ufb01nd how intra- and inter-class ND in\ufb02uence ND together.

Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"block processing neural networks\"*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep learning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning. Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper, we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet, DVS Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, and show that SEW ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in both accuracy and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher performance by simply adding more layers, providing a simple method to train deep SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training deep SNNs with more than 100 layers becomes possible.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued states in language models\"*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Algorithm and Hardness for Dynamic Attention Maintenance in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued states in language models\"*\n\n*Jan van den Brand, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false, and there is no algorithm that can use both the amortized update time and the worst-case query time of the proposed algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have made fundamental changes in human life. The attention scheme is one of the key components over all the LLMs, such as BERT, GPT-1, Transformers, GPT-2, 3, 3.5 and 4. Inspired by previous theoretical study of static version of the attention multiplication problem [Zandieh, Han, Daliri, and Karbasi arXiv 2023, Alman and Song arXiv 2023]. In this work, we formally define a dynamic version of attention matrix multiplication problem. There are matrices $Q,K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, they represent query, key and value in LLMs. In each iteration we update one entry in $K$ or $V$. In the query stage, we receive $(i,j) \\in [n] \\times [d]$ as input, and want to answer $(D^{-1} A V)_{i,j}$, where $A:=\\exp(QK^\\top) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a square matrix and $D := \\mathrm{diag}(A {\\bf 1}_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix. Here ${\\bf 1}_n$ denote a length-$n$ vector that all the entries are ones. We provide two results: an algorithm and a conditional lower bound. $\\bullet$ On one hand, inspired by the lazy update idea from [Demetrescu and Italiano FOCS 2000, Sankowski FOCS 2004, Cohen, Lee and Song STOC 2019, Brand SODA 2020], we provide a data-structure that uses $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau)-\\tau})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau})$ worst-case query time. $\\bullet$ On the other hand, show that unless the hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture [Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak FOCS 2019] is false, there is no algorithm that can use both $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau) - \\tau- \\Omega(1)})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau-\\Omega(1)})$ worst query time. In conclusion, our algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9.

Zico Kolter, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that state space models such as Mamba are significantly\nworse than Transformers on recall-based tasks due to the fact that their state\nsize is constant with respect to their input sequence length.

Diagonal State Spaces are as Effective as Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued state space models\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Albert Gu, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long range dependencies in sequential data is a fundamental step\ntowards attaining human-level performance in many modalities such as text,\nvision, audio and video. While attention-based models are a popular and\neffective choice in modeling short-range interactions, their performance on\ntasks requiring long range reasoning has been largely inadequate. In an\nexciting result, Gu et al. (ICLR 2022) proposed the $\\textit{Structured State\nSpace}$ (S4) architecture delivering large gains over state-of-the-art models\non several long-range tasks across various modalities. The core proposition of\nS4 is the parameterization of state matrices via a diagonal plus low rank\nstructure, allowing efficient computation. In this work, we show that one can\nmatch the performance of S4 even without the low rank correction and thus\nassuming the state matrices to be diagonal. Our $\\textit{Diagonal State Space}$\n(DSS) model matches the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena tasks, speech\nclassification on Speech Commands dataset, while being conceptually simpler and\nstraightforward to implement.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-27T16:30:33Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-18T18:30:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. MessageNet: Message Classification using Natural Language Processing and\n  Meta-data\n\n*From Search Query: \"block processing neural networks\"*\n\n*Adar Kahana, Oren Elisha*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we propose a new Deep Learning (DL) approach for message\nclassification. Our method is based on the state-of-the-art Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) building blocks, combined with a novel technique for infusing\nthe meta-data input that is typically available in messages such as the sender\ninformation, timestamps, attached image, audio, affiliations, and more. As we\ndemonstrate throughout the paper, going beyond the mere text by leveraging all\navailable channels in the message, could yield an improved representation and\nhigher classification accuracy. To achieve message representation, each type of\ninput is processed in a dedicated block in the neural network architecture that\nis suitable for the data type. Such an implementation enables training all\nblocks together simultaneously, and forming cross channels features in the\nnetwork. We show in the Experiments Section that in some cases, message's\nmeta-data holds an additional information that cannot be extracted just from\nthe text, and when using this information we achieve better performance.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our multi-modality block approach outperforms\nother approaches for injecting the meta data to the the text classifier.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-04T20:11:00Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-04T20:11:00Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

In this paper,\nwe present a new methodology to significantly reduce the number of parameters\nin RNNs while maintaining performance that is comparable or even better than\nclassical RNNs. The new proposal, referred to as Restricted Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RRNN), restricts the weight matrices corresponding to the input data\nand hidden states at each time step to share a large proportion of parameters.\nThe new architecture can be regarded as a compression of its classical\ncounterpart, but it does not require pre-training or sophisticated parameter\nfine-tuning, both of which are major issues in most existing compression\ntechniques. Experiments on natural language modeling show that compared with\nits classical counterpart, the restricted recurrent architecture generally\nproduces comparable results at about 50\\% compression rate. In particular, the\nRestricted LSTM can outperform classical RNN with even less number of\nparameters.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-21T07:12:31Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-14T21:52:34Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

However, this\nperformance is usually tested and reported on high-resource languages, like\nEnglish, French, Spanish, and German.

We reconcile both expressiveness\nand complexity through the use of complex-valued embeddings and explore the\nlink between such complex-valued embeddings and unitary diagonalization.

Watch Your Step: Learning Node Embeddings via Graph Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued state space models\"*\n\n*Rami Al-Rfou, Sami Abu-El-Haija, Bryan Perozzi, Alex Alemi*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph embedding methods represent nodes in a continuous vector space,\npreserving information from the graph (e.g. by sampling random walks). There\nare many hyper-parameters to these methods (such as random walk length) which\nhave to be manually tuned for every graph. In this paper, we replace random\nwalk hyper-parameters with trainable parameters that we automatically learn via\nbackpropagation. In particular, we learn a novel attention model on the power\nseries of the transition matrix, which guides the random walk to optimize an\nupstream objective. Unlike previous approaches to attention models, the method\nthat we propose utilizes attention parameters exclusively on the data (e.g. on\nthe random walk), and not used by the model for inference. We experiment on\nlink prediction tasks, as we aim to produce embeddings that best-preserve the\ngraph structure, generalizing to unseen information. We improve\nstate-of-the-art on a comprehensive suite of real world datasets including\nsocial, collaboration, and biological networks. Adding attention to random\nwalks can reduce the error by 20% to 45% on datasets we attempted. Further, our\nlearned attention parameters are different for every graph, and our\nautomatically-found values agree with the optimal choice of hyper-parameter if\nwe manually tune existing methods.\n\n**Conference:** watch-your-step-learning-node-embeddings-via-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformer in Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"block processing neural networks\"*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chunjing Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Enhua Wu, An Xiao, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost.

Beyond 512 Tokens: Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder for Long-Form Document Matching\n\n*From Search Query: \"block processing neural networks\"*\n\n*Liu Yang, Michael Bendersky, Mingyang Zhang, Marc Najork, Cheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing and information retrieval problems can be formalized as the task of semantic matching. Existing work in this area has been largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question answering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval). Semantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important applications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and document clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research effort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These models, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one paragraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with respect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for long-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt self-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture sentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model with a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the masked word language modeling task used by BERT. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets for long-form document matching show that our proposed SMITH model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models including hierarchical attention, multi-depth attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network, and BERT. Comparing to BERT based baselines, our model is able to increase maximum input text length from 512 to 2048. We will open source a Wikipedia based benchmark dataset, code and a pre-trained checkpoint to accelerate future research on long-form document matching.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"matrix-valued states in language models\"*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations.

Instead of searching for a single adversarial example, we search for a distribution of adversarial examples parameterized by a continuous-valued matrix, hence enabling gradient-based optimization. We empirically demonstrate that our white-box attack attains state-of-the-art attack performance on a variety of natural language tasks. Furthermore, we show that a powerful black-box transfer attack, enabled by sampling from the adversarial distribution, matches or exceeds existing methods, while only requiring hard-label outputs.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that incorporates matrix-valued states and block-based processing, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Matrix-Valued States in Language Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss matrix-valued states in the context of RetNet or similar GAUs, the concept of using matrix-valued representations in neural networks is explored in other domains. For instance, the idea of state-space models (SSMs) and their application in capturing long-range dependencies can be adapted to language models. The work on **Mamba** and **Spatial-Mamba** shows how SSMs can be integrated into deep learning architectures, which could be a starting point for incorporating matrix-valued states.\n\n### Block-Based Processing\n\n- Block-based processing is a common technique for optimizing neural network computations. In the context of language models, this could involve processing input sequences in blocks to improve memory access patterns and reduce computational overhead. The **Spatial-Mamba** approach, which uses structure-aware state fusion to capture spatial dependencies, could be an inspiration for block-based processing in language models.\n\n### Impact on Model Capacity, Efficiency, and Scalability\n\n- **Model Capacity**: Introducing matrix-valued states can potentially increase the expressivity of the model by allowing it to capture more complex relationships between different parts of the input sequence. This is similar to how **Mamba** and **Spatial-Mamba** enhance the modeling capabilities by leveraging state-space duality and structure-aware state fusion.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: The use of matrix-valued states may increase the computational complexity, particularly in terms of space complexity (\\(O(d^2)\\)). However, optimizations such as block-based processing can help mitigate these issues. The **Mamba** framework, for example, achieves near-linear scalability concerning sequence length, which is a promising direction for efficient modeling.\n\n### Relevant Concepts and Techniques\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: SSMs are traditionally used to describe the dynamics of continuous systems and can be adapted for discrete-time sequences. The integration of SSMs with deep learning architectures, as seen in **Mamba** and **Spatial-Mamba**, provides a framework for efficient and scalable modeling.\n\n- **Structure-Aware State Fusion**: This technique, used in **Spatial-Mamba**, involves employing dilated convolutions to capture spatial dependencies. A similar approach could be adapted to language models to capture contextual dependencies more effectively.\n\n### Future Search and Implementation Directions\n\n- **Search for Similar Architectures**: Look for recent papers or preprints that have applied matrix-valued states or similar concepts to other autoregressive language models. For example, the **Eagle and Finch** model, which uses matrix-valued states in the RWKV architecture, could provide valuable insights[Note: This is a hypothetical example and may not be an actual paper].\n\n- **Training Stability Techniques**: Investigate techniques for ensuring training stability when using matrix-valued states. This might involve state normalization, regularization methods, or other stability controls.\n\n- **Empirical Evaluations**: Seek out empirical studies or benchmarks that evaluate the performance of models using matrix-valued states and block-based processing. This will help in understanding the practical implications and benefits of such an approach.\n\n### Example Implementation Ideas\n\n- **Matrix-Valued RetNetMLP**:\n  - Integrate matrix-valued states into the RetNetMLP architecture by modifying the state transition equations to handle matrix-valued representations.\n  - Implement block-based processing to optimize the computation of these matrix-valued states, potentially using techniques similar to those in **Spatial-Mamba**.\n\n- **Efficiency Optimizations**:\n  - Use structure-aware state fusion or similar techniques to capture contextual dependencies efficiently.\n  - Optimize the model for hardware efficiency by ensuring that the block-based processing aligns well with memory access patterns and computational resources.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages matrix-valued states and block-based processing, potentially leading to improved model capacity, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n**Novelty Assessment:**\n\n- **Matrix-Valued States in RetNetMLP**: Based on the search results, there is no direct evidence of matrix-valued states being applied specifically to the **RetNetMLP**. The use of matrix-valued states has been explored in other architectures like RWKV (Eagle and Finch) and HGRN2, but integrating this concept into RetNetMLP appears to be a novel application.\n\n- **Relation to RetNet**: The RetNet architecture focuses on retention mechanisms but does not explicitly utilize matrix-valued states. Therefore, the proposal to enhance RetNetMLP with matrix-valued states may offer a new direction for this model.\n\n**Block-Based Processing:**\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Block-based processing is a recognized technique for optimizing hardware utilization. However, combining block processing with matrix-valued states in language models does not seem to be extensively explored in current literature.\n\n- **Potential Benefits**: Implementing block-based processing in conjunction with matrix-valued states could improve memory access patterns and computational efficiency, which is crucial for scaling up language models.\n\n**Impact on Scalability and Efficiency:**\n\n- **Computational Complexity**: Introducing matrix-valued states increases space complexity to \\( O(d^2) \\), which may affect scalability for large models. However, careful implementation and hardware optimizations (such as block processing) could mitigate these concerns.\n\n- **Training Stability**: Matrix-valued states may introduce challenges in training stability. The proposal's inclusion of state normalization and stability controls is essential to ensure successful model training.\n\n**Alignment with Current Research Trends:**\n\n- The proposal aligns with efforts to increase model expressivity and capacity through richer representations.\n\n- Emphasizing hardware-aware optimizations reflects the industry's move towards efficient and scalable model implementations.\n\n### 4.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nPeng, B., Goldstein, D., Anthony, Q., Albalak, A., Alcaide, E., Biderman, S., Cheah, E., Du, X., Ferdinan, T., Hou, H., Kazienko, P., GV, K.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.

ERL-Re2: Efficient Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Shared State Representation and Individual Policy Representation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient matrix-valued state representation\"*\n\n*Pengyi Li, Hongyao Tang, Jianye Hao, Yan Zheng, Xian Fu, Zhaopeng Meng*\n\n**TL;DR:** Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re$^2$), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks of Deep RL, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles, i.e., gradient-based v.s. gradient-free. An appealing research direction is integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks: 1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually, neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re$^2$), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re$^2$ is two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state representation while maintaining individual} linear policy representations. The state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover, the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy fitness with the help of the Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA), further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re$^2$ consistently outperforms advanced baselines and achieves the State Of The Art (SOTA).

LLM-Empowered State Representation for Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient matrix-valued state representation\"*\n\n*Boyuan Wang, Yun Qu, Yuhang Jiang, Jianzhun Shao, Chang Liu, Wenming Yang, Xiangyang Ji*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LLM-Empowered State Representation (LESR), a novel approach that utilizes LLM to autonomously generate task-related state representation codes which help to enhance the continuity of network mappings and facilitate efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Conventional state representations in reinforcement learning often omit critical task-related details, presenting a significant challenge for value networks in establishing accurate mappings from states to task rewards. Traditional methods typically depend on extensive sample learning to enrich state representations with task-specific information, which leads to low sample efficiency and high time costs. Recently, surging knowledgeable large language models (LLM) have provided promising substitutes for prior injection with minimal human intervention. Motivated by this, we propose LLM-Empowered State Representation (LESR), a novel approach that utilizes LLM to autonomously generate task-related state representation codes which help to enhance the continuity of network mappings and facilitate efficient training. Experimental results demonstrate LESR exhibits high sample efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 29% in accumulated reward in Mujoco tasks and 30% in success rates in Gym-Robotics tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

We introduce TensorNet, an innovative O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network architecture that leverages Cartesian tensor representations. By using Cartesian tensor atomic embeddings, feature mixing is simplified through matrix product operations. Furthermore, the cost-effective decomposition of these tensors into rotation group irreducible representations allows for the separate processing of scalars, vectors, and tensors when necessary. Compared to higher-rank spherical tensor models, TensorNet demonstrates state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters. For small molecule potential energies, this can be achieved even with a single interaction layer. As a result of all these properties, the model's computational cost is substantially decreased. Moreover, the accurate prediction of vector and tensor molecular quantities on top of potential energies and forces is possible. In summary, TensorNet's framework opens up a new space for the design of state-of-the-art equivariant models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. An Optimal and Scalable Matrix Mechanism for Noisy Marginals under Convex Loss Functions\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Yingtai Xiao, Guanlin He, Danfeng Zhang, Daniel Kifer*\n\n**TL;DR:** ResidualPlanner is proposed, a matrix mechanism for marginals with Gaussian noise that is both optimal and scalable and can optimize for many loss functions that can be written as a convex function of marginal variances.\n\n**Abstract:** Noisy marginals are a common form of confidentiality-protecting data release and are useful for many downstream tasks such as contingency table analysis, construction of Bayesian networks, and even synthetic data generation. Privacy mechanisms that provide unbiased noisy answers to linear queries (such as marginals) are known as matrix mechanisms. We propose ResidualPlanner, a matrix mechanism for marginals with Gaussian noise that is both optimal and scalable. ResidualPlanner can optimize for many loss functions that can be written as a convex function of marginal variances (prior work was restricted to just one predefined objective function). ResidualPlanner can optimize the accuracy of marginals in large scale settings in seconds, even when the previous state of the art (HDMM) runs out of memory. It even runs on datasets with 100 attributes in a couple of minutes. Furthermore ResidualPlanner can efficiently compute variance/covariance values for each marginal (prior methods quickly run out of memory, even for relatively small datasets).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Multimodal Graph Networks for Compositional Generalization in Visual Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Raeid Saqur, Karthik Narasimhan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a model that creates a multimodal graph, processes it with a graph neural network to induce a factor correspondence matrix, and then outputs a symbolic program to predict answers to questions.\n\n**Abstract:** Compositional generalization is a key challenge in grounding natural language to visual perception. While deep learning models have achieved great success in multimodal tasks like visual question answering, recent studies have shown that they fail to generalize to new inputs that are simply an unseen combination of those seen in the training distribution [6]. In this paper, we propose to tackle this challenge by employing neural factor graphs to induce a tighter coupling between concepts in different modalities (e.g. images and text). Graph representations are inherently compositional in nature and allow us to capture entities, attributes and relations in a scalable manner. Our model \ufb01rst creates a multimodal graph, processes it with a graph neural network to induce a factor correspondence matrix, and then outputs a symbolic program to predict answers to questions. Empirically, our model achieves close to perfect scores on a caption truth prediction problem and state-of-the-art results on the recently introduced CLOSURE dataset, improving on the mean overall accuracy across seven compositional templates by 4.77% over previous approaches. 2\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively.

Learning to Stabilize Online Reinforcement Learning in Unbounded State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Brahma S. Pavse, M. Zurek, Yudong Chen, Qiaomin Xie, Josiah P. Hanna*\n\n**TL;DR:** An approach based on a Lyapunov-based cost-shaping technique and state transformations to the unbounded state space is introduced that performs competitively against strong baselines with knowledge of the transition dynamics.\n\n**Abstract:** In many reinforcement learning (RL) applications, we want policies that reach desired states and then keep the controlled system within an acceptable region around the desired states over an indefinite period of time. This latter objective is called stability and is especially important when the state space is unbounded, such that the states can be arbitrarily far from each other and the agent can drift far away from the desired states. For example, in stochastic queuing networks, where queues of waiting jobs can grow without bound, the desired state is all-zero queue lengths. Here, a stable policy ensures queue lengths are finite while an optimal policy minimizes queue lengths. Since an optimal policy is also stable, one would expect that RL algorithms would implicitly give us stable policies. However, in this work, we find that deep RL algorithms that directly minimize the distance to the desired state during online training often result in unstable policies, i.e., policies that drift far away from the desired state. We attribute this instability to poor credit-assignment for destabilizing actions. We then introduce an approach based on two ideas: 1) a Lyapunov-based cost-shaping technique and 2) state transformations to the unbounded state space. We conduct an empirical study on various queueing networks and traffic signal control problems and find that our approach performs competitively against strong baselines with knowledge of the transition dynamics.

End-to-End Learning to Index and Search in Large Output Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Nilesh Gupta, Patrick H. Chen, Hsiang-Fu Yu, Cho-Jui Hsieh, I. Dhillon*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method ELIAS is proposed which relaxes the tree- based index to a specialized weighted graph-based index which is learned end-to-end with the final task objective and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale extreme classification benchmarks with millions of labels.\n\n**Abstract:** Extreme multi-label classification (XMC) is a popular framework for solving many real-world problems that require accurate prediction from a very large number of potential output choices. A popular approach for dealing with the large label space is to arrange the labels into a shallow tree-based index and then learn an ML model to efficiently search this index via beam search. Existing methods initialize the tree index by clustering the label space into a few mutually exclusive clusters based on pre-defined features and keep it fixed throughout the training procedure. This approach results in a sub-optimal indexing structure over the label space and limits the search performance to the quality of choices made during the initialization of the index. In this paper, we propose a novel method ELIAS which relaxes the tree-based index to a specialized weighted graph-based index which is learned end-to-end with the final task objective. More specifically, ELIAS models the discrete cluster-to-label assignments in the existing tree-based index as soft learnable parameters that are learned jointly with the rest of the ML model. ELIAS achieves state-of-the-art performance on several large-scale extreme classification benchmarks with millions of labels. In particular, ELIAS can be up to 2.5% better at precision@1 and up to 4% better at recall@100 than existing XMC methods.

ToolLLM: Facilitating Large Language Models to Master 16000+ Real-world APIs\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Yujia Qin, Shi Liang, Yining Ye, Kunlun Zhu, Lan Yan, Ya-Ting Lu, Yankai Lin, Xin Cong, Xiangru Tang, Bill Qian, Sihan Zhao, Runchu Tian, Ruobing Xie, Jie Zhou, M. Gerstein, Dahai Li, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** ToolLLM is introduced, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation, and a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm that enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16,464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 405  (*Influential: 81*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Efficient Vector Representation for Documents through Corruption\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient matrix-valued state representation\"*\n\n*Minmin Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present an efficient document representation learning framework, Document\nVector through Corruption (Doc2VecC).

A\ncorruption model is included, which introduces a data-dependent regularization\nthat favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common\nand non-discriminative ones to be close to zero. Doc2VecC produces\nsignificantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with\nseveral state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The\nsimple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the\nstate-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for\nsentiment analysis, document classification as well as semantic relatedness\ntasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per\nhour on a single machine.

Robust and Scalable Differentiable Neural Computer for Question\n  Answering\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*J\u00f6rg Franke, Jan Niehues, Alex Waibel*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models are often not easily adaptable to new tasks and require\ntask-specific adjustments. The differentiable neural computer (DNC), a\nmemory-augmented neural network, is designed as a general problem solver which\ncan be used in a wide range of tasks. But in reality, it is hard to apply this\nmodel to new tasks. We analyze the DNC and identify possible improvements\nwithin the application of question answering. This motivates a more robust and\nscalable DNC (rsDNC). The objective precondition is to keep the general\ncharacter of this model intact while making its application more reliable and\nspeeding up its required training time. The rsDNC is distinguished by a more\nrobust training, a slim memory unit and a bidirectional architecture. We not\nonly achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI task, but also\nminimize the performance variance between different initializations.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the simplified applicability of the rsDNC to new\ntasks with passable results on the CNN RC task without adaptions.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-07T12:44:32Z  (*Updated: 2018-07-07T12:44:32Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Extracting Weighted Finite Automata from Recurrent Neural Networks for\n  Natural Languages\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Zeming Wei, Xiyue Zhang, Meng Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved tremendous success in\nsequential data processing. However, it is quite challenging to interpret and\nverify RNNs' behaviors directly. To this end, many efforts have been made to\nextract finite automata from RNNs. Existing approaches such as exact learning\nare effective in extracting finite-state models to characterize the state\ndynamics of RNNs for formal languages, but are limited in the scalability to\nprocess natural languages. Compositional approaches that are scablable to\nnatural languages fall short in extraction precision. In this paper, we\nidentify the transition sparsity problem that heavily impacts the extraction\nprecision. To address this problem, we propose a transition rule extraction\napproach, which is scalable to natural language processing models and effective\nin improving extraction precision. Specifically, we propose an empirical method\nto complement the missing rules in the transition diagram. In addition, we\nfurther adjust the transition matrices to enhance the context-aware ability of\nthe extracted weighted finite automaton (WFA). Finally, we propose two data\naugmentation tactics to track more dynamic behaviors of the target RNN.\nExperiments on two popular natural language datasets show that our method can\nextract WFA from RNN for natural language processing with better precision than\nexisting approaches.

Adaptive Fine-Tuning of Transformer-Based Language Models for Named\n  Entity Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Felix Stollenwerk*\n\n**Abstract:** The current standard approach for fine-tuning transformer-based language\nmodels includes a fixed number of training epochs and a linear learning rate\nschedule. In order to obtain a near-optimal model for the given downstream\ntask, a search in optimization hyperparameter space is usually required. In\nparticular, the number of training epochs needs to be adjusted to the dataset\nsize. In this paper, we introduce adaptive fine-tuning, which is an alternative\napproach that uses early stopping and a custom learning rate schedule to\ndynamically adjust the number of training epochs to the dataset size. For the\nexample use case of named entity recognition, we show that our approach not\nonly makes hyperparameter search with respect to the number of training epochs\nredundant, but also leads to improved results in terms of performance,\nstability and efficiency. This holds true especially for small datasets, where\nwe outperform the state-of-the-art fine-tuning method by a large margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-05T19:20:03Z  (*Updated: 2022-02-05T19:20:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Training Heterogeneous Features in Sequence to Sequence Tasks: Latent\n  Enhanced Multi-filter Seq2Seq Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Yunhao Yang, Zhaokun Xue*\n\n**Abstract:** In language processing, training data with extremely large variance may lead\nto difficulty in the language model's convergence. It is difficult for the\nnetwork parameters to adapt sentences with largely varied semantics or\ngrammatical structures. To resolve this problem, we introduce a model that\nconcentrates the each of the heterogeneous features in the input sentences.\nBuilding upon the encoder-decoder architecture, we design a latent-enhanced\nmulti-filter seq2seq model (LEMS) that analyzes the input representations by\nintroducing a latent space transformation and clustering. The representations\nare extracted from the final hidden state of the encoder and lie in the latent\nspace. A latent space transformation is applied for enhancing the quality of\nthe representations. Thus the clustering algorithm can easily separate samples\nbased on the features of these representations. Multiple filters are trained by\nthe features from their corresponding clusters, and the heterogeneity of the\ntraining data can be resolved accordingly. We conduct two sets of comparative\nexperiments on semantic parsing and machine translation, using the Geo-query\ndataset and Multi30k English-French to demonstrate the enhancement our model\nhas made respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-18T21:42:41Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-25T14:40:47Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. On the effective reconstruction of expectation values from ab initio quantum embedding\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient matrix-valued state representation\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantum embedding is an appealing route to fragment a large interacting quantum system into several smaller auxiliary `cluster' problems to exploit the locality of the correlated physics. In this work we critically review approaches to recombine these fragmented solutions in order to compute non-local expectation values, including the total energy. Starting from the democratic partitioning of expectation values used in density matrix embedding theory, we motivate and develop a number of alternative approaches, numerically demonstrating their efficiency and improved accuracy as a function of increasing cluster size for both energetics and non-local two-body observables in molecular and solid state systems. These approaches consider the $N$-representability of the resulting expectation values via an implicit global wave~function across the clusters, as well as the importance of including contributions to expectation values spanning multiple fragments simultaneously, thereby alleviating the fundamental locality approximation of the embedding. We clearly demonstrate the value of these introduced functionals for reliable extraction of observables and robust and systematic convergence as the cluster size increases, allowing for significantly smaller clusters to be used for a desired accuracy compared to traditional approaches in ab initio wave~function quantum embedding.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. RGCNN: Regularized Graph CNN for Point Cloud Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient matrix-valued state representation\"*\n\n*Amin Zheng, Gusi Te, Zongming Guo, Wei Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Point cloud, an efficient 3D object representation, has become popular with\nthe development of depth sensing and 3D laser scanning techniques. It has\nattracted attention in various applications such as 3D tele-presence,\nnavigation for unmanned vehicles and heritage reconstruction. The understanding\nof point clouds, such as point cloud segmentation, is crucial in exploiting the\ninformative value of point clouds for such applications. Due to the\nirregularity of the data format, previous deep learning works often convert\npoint clouds to regular 3D voxel grids or collections of images before feeding\nthem into neural networks, which leads to voluminous data and quantization\nartifacts. In this paper, we instead propose a regularized graph convolutional\nneural network (RGCNN) that directly consumes point clouds. Leveraging on\nspectral graph theory, we treat features of points in a point cloud as signals\non graph, and define the convolution over graph by Chebyshev polynomial\napproximation. In particular, we update the graph Laplacian matrix that\ndescribes the connectivity of features in each layer according to the\ncorresponding learned features, which adaptively captures the structure of\ndynamic graphs. Further, we deploy a graph-signal smoothness prior in the loss\nfunction, thus regularizing the learning process. Experimental results on the\nShapeNet part dataset show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity while achieving competitive performance with the state\nof the art. Also, experiments show RGCNN is much more robust to both noise and\npoint cloud density in comparison with other methods. We further apply RGCNN to\npoint cloud classification and achieve competitive results on ModelNet40\ndataset.\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. SIGN: Scalable Inception Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Davide Eynard, Federico Monti, Fabrizio Frasca, Ben Chamberlain, Michael Bronstein, Emanuele Rossi*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph representation learning has recently been applied to a broad spectrum of problems ranging from computer graphics and chemistry to high energy physics and social media. The popularity of graph neural networks has sparked interest, both in academia and in industry, in developing methods that scale to very large graphs such as Facebook or Twitter social networks. In most of these approaches, the computational cost is alleviated by a sampling strategy retaining a subset of node neighbors or subgraphs at training time. In this paper we propose a new, efficient and scalable graph deep learning architecture which sidesteps the need for graph sampling by using graph convolutional filters of different size that are amenable to efficient precomputation, allowing extremely fast training and inference. Our architecture allows using different local graph operators (e.g. motif-induced adjacency matrices or Personalized Page Rank diffusion matrix) to best suit the task at hand. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation on various open benchmarks and show that our approach is competitive with other state-of-the-art architectures, while requiring a fraction of the training and inference time. Moreover, we obtain state-of-the-art results on ogbn-papers100M, the largest public graph dataset, with over 110 million nodes and 1.5 billion edges.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Infinite Recommendation Networks: A Data-Centric Approach\n\n*From Search Query: \"scalable matrix state neural networks\"*\n\n*Julian McAuley, Carole-Jean Wu, Mehak Preet Dhaliwal, Noveen Sachdeva*\n\n**Abstract:** We leverage the Neural Tangent Kernel and its equivalence to training infinitely-wide neural networks to devise $\\infty$-AE: an autoencoder with infinitely-wide bottleneck layers. The outcome is a highly expressive yet simplistic recommendation model with a single hyper-parameter and a closed-form solution. Leveraging $\\infty$-AE's simplicity, we also develop Distill-CF for synthesizing tiny, high-fidelity data summaries which distill the most important knowledge from the extremely large and sparse user-item interaction matrix for efficient and accurate subsequent data-usage like model training, inference, architecture search, etc. This takes a data-centric approach to recommendation, where we aim to improve the quality of logged user-feedback data for subsequent modeling, independent of the learning algorithm. We particularly utilize the concept of differentiable Gumbel-sampling to handle the inherent data heterogeneity, sparsity, and semi-structuredness, while being scalable to datasets with hundreds of millions of user-item interactions. Both of our proposed approaches significantly outperform their respective state-of-the-art and when used together, we observe 96-105% of $\\infty$-AE's performance on the full dataset with as little as 0.1% of the original dataset size, leading us to explore the counter-intuitive question: Is more data what you need for better recommendation?\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-03\n\n\n\n#### 5. Unified-IO 2: Scaling Autoregressive Multimodal Models with Vision, Language, Audio, and Action\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Aniruddha Kembhavi, Derek Hoiem, Ryan Marten, Savya Khosla, Zichen Zhang, Sangho Lee, Christopher Clark, Jiasen Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Unified-IO 2, the first autoregressive multimodal model that is capable of understanding and generating image, text, audio, and action. To unify different modalities, we tokenize inputs and outputs -- images, text, audio, action, bounding boxes, etc., into a shared semantic space and then process them with a single encoder-decoder transformer model. Since training with such diverse modalities is challenging, we propose various architectural improvements to stabilize model training. We train our model from scratch on a large multimodal pre-training corpus from diverse sources with a multimodal mixture of denoisers objective. To learn an expansive set of skills, such as following multimodal instructions, we construct and finetune on an ensemble of 120 datasets with prompts and augmentations. With a single unified model, Unified-IO 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GRIT benchmark and strong results in more than 35 benchmarks, including image generation and understanding, natural language understanding, video and audio understanding, and robotic manipulation. We release all our models to the research community.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. Progressive Differentiable Architecture Search: Bridging the Depth Gap between Search and Evaluation\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability with large state spaces\"*\n\n*Qi Tian, Lingxi Xie, Jun Wu, Xin Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, differentiable search methods have made major progress in reducing\nthe computational costs of neural architecture search. However, these\napproaches often report lower accuracy in evaluating the searched architecture\nor transferring it to another dataset. This is arguably due to the large gap\nbetween the architecture depths in search and evaluation scenarios. In this\npaper, we present an efficient algorithm which allows the depth of searched\narchitectures to grow gradually during the training procedure. This brings two\nissues, namely, heavier computational overheads and weaker search stability,\nwhich we solve using search space approximation and regularization,\nrespectively. With a significantly reduced search time (~7 hours on a single\nGPU), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the proxy\ndataset (CIFAR10 or CIFAR100) and the target dataset (ImageNet).
