Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Attention as an RNN (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Mohamed Osama Ahmed, Y. Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/34 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n(Left) Memory Usage Comparison. (Right) Cumulative Time Comparison. only a vector. Measuring this empirically in comparable models, we found that Transformers used $3,152,384$ parameters. In contrast, the equivalent Aarens used 3, 152, 896 parameters, representing only a marginal $\\sim 0.016 \\%$ parameter increase - a minor trade-off for the significant gains in memory and time complexities. ## 5 Related Work\n\nClosest to Aaren are approximations of attention such as those by RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). These models proposed linearizations of the standard softmax-based attention that allow them to be formulated as an RNN. However, in doing so, these models also encode an exponential factor that biases tokens based on their timestamp, limiting their potential applications. In contrast, Aaren leverages an exact re-formulation of softmax attention as an RNN, allowing the model itself to compute the weight of each token. Feng et al. (2023) showed attention can be computed recurrently, using it to compress set-based inputs. Rabe and Staats (2022) introduced a recurrent formulation of attention, showing that self-attention can be computed efficiently. Katharopoulos et al. (2020) showed that Transformers with a causal mask can be viewed as an RNN. In contrast, we (1) show a more general result whereas any attention model can be viewed as an RNN. Furthermore, we (2) introduce Aaren, a new attention formulation based on parallel prefix sums, that achieves competitive results with that of Transformers while being more efficient. The problem of computing prefix scans/sums has been well studied with various efficient parallelized algorithms proposed for computing them. Since Aaren only requires the output of the prefix scan, any efficient algorithm for computing it can be used. In this work, we outlined the method by Hillis and Steele (1986). This method is time efficient for parallel computation, requiring $\\log _{2}(N)$ sequential steps and $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log (N))$ overall computation. In contrast, the method by Ladner and Fischer (1980) use mores sequential steps (specifically, $2 \\log _{2}(N)-2$ ) but only performs $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ overall computation. For a more in-depth introduction to parallel prefix sums algorithms, we refer the reader to the following work by Blelloch (1990). In this work, we applied Transformers to a subset of applications. For a broad overview of the applications of Transformers, we refer the reader to the following survey by Islam et al. (2023). For an overview of different transformer models applied to the specific settings considered in this paper, we refer the reader to the following surveys (1) on transformers in reinforcement learning by Li et al. (2023) and (2) on transformers in event forecasting, time series forecasting, time series classification, and more by Wen et al. (2022). ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we showed that attention can be formulated as an RNN whereas the conventional way of computing attention is a parallelized method of computing its many-to-one RNN output. Building on the RNN formulation, we showed that existing attention-based models can be formulated as RNNs. However, unlike traditional RNNs such as LSTMs and GRUs, these methods cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens. Addressing this, we introduced a new parallelized method of computing attention's many-to-many RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we introduced Aaren, a new module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be efficiently updated at inference time, thereby requiring only constant memory (like RNNs). Empirically, we showed that Aarens achieve performance competitive with Transformers on 38 datasets spread across four sequential data settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting. Finally, we empirically show that Aarens are significantly more time and memory-efficient than Transformers. ## References\n\nAgarwal, P., Rahman, A. A., St-Charles, P.-L., Prince, S.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.74)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 4301  (*Influential: 554*)\n\n#### 2. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3. AMR Parsing with Causal Hierarchical Attention and Pointers\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chao Lou, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel model is introduced, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder, and which outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Abstract:** Translation-based AMR parsers have recently gained popularity due to their simplicity and effectiveness. They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options. Experiments show that our model outperforms baseline models on four out of five benchmarks in the setting of no additional data.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Reading Turn by Turn: Hierarchical Attention Architecture for Spoken Dialogue Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Zhengyuan Liu, Nancy F. Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance, and empirically shows that the proposed approach outperforms standard attention baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and is more robust to lengthy and out-of-distribution test samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Comprehending multi-turn spoken conversations is an emerging research area, presenting challenges different from reading comprehension of passages due to the interactive nature of information exchange from at least two speakers. Unlike passages, where sentences are often the default semantic modeling unit, in multi-turn conversations, a turn is a topically coherent unit embodied with immediately relevant context, making it a linguistically intuitive segment for computationally modeling verbal interactions. Therefore, in this work, we propose a hierarchical attention neural network architecture, combining turn-level and word-level attention mechanisms, to improve spoken dialogue comprehension performance. Experiments are conducted on a multi-turn conversation dataset, where nurses inquire and discuss symptom information with patients. We empirically show that the proposed approach outperforms standard attention baselines, achieves more efficient learning outcomes, and is more robust to lengthy and out-of-distribution test samples.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Bidirectional Attention Flow for Machine Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ali Farhadi, Minjoon Seo, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Aniruddha Kembhavi*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine comprehension (MC), answering a query about a given context\nparagraph, requires modeling complex interactions between the context and the\nquery.

ViViD: Video Virtual Try-on using Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Zheng-Jun Zha, Yang Cao, Zhiheng Liu, Yu Chen, Mao Wang, Kai Zhu, Hongliang Song, Aimin Su, Wei Zhai, Zixun Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Video virtual try-on aims to transfer a clothing item onto the video of a target person. Directly applying the technique of image-based try-on to the video domain in a frame-wise manner will cause temporal-inconsistent outcomes while previous video-based try-on solutions can only generate low visual quality and blurring results. In this work, we present ViViD, a novel framework employing powerful diffusion models to tackle the task of video virtual try-on. Specifically, we design the Garment Encoder to extract fine-grained clothing semantic features, guiding the model to capture garment details and inject them into the target video through the proposed attention feature fusion mechanism. To ensure spatial-temporal consistency, we introduce a lightweight Pose Encoder to encode pose signals, enabling the model to learn the interactions between clothing and human posture and insert hierarchical Temporal Modules into the text-to-image stable diffusion model for more coherent and lifelike video synthesis. Furthermore, we collect a new dataset, which is the largest, with the most diverse types of garments and the highest resolution for the task of video virtual try-on to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is able to yield satisfactory video try-on results. The dataset, codes, and weights will be publicly available.

FormerTime: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Representations for Multivariate Time Series Classification\n\n*From Search Query: temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms*\n\n*Enhong Chen, Yucong Luo, Zhi Li, Zhiding Liu, Qi Liu, Mingyue Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning-based algorithms, e.g., convolutional networks, have significantly facilitated multivariate time series classification (MTSC) task. Nevertheless, they suffer from the limitation in modeling long-range dependence due to the nature of convolution operations. Recent advancements have shown the potential of transformers to capture long-range dependence. However, it would incur severe issues, such as fixed scale representations, temporal-invariant and quadratic time complexity, with transformers directly applicable to the MTSC task because of the distinct properties of time series data. To tackle these issues, we propose FormerTime, an hierarchical representation model for improving the classification capacity for the MTSC task. In the proposed FormerTime, we employ a hierarchical network architecture to perform multi-scale feature maps. Besides, a novel transformer encoder is further designed, in which an efficient temporal reduction attention layer and a well-informed contextual positional encoding generating strategy are developed. To sum up, FormerTime exhibits three aspects of merits: (1) learning hierarchical multi-scale representations from time series data, (2) inheriting the strength of both transformers and convolutional networks, and (3) tacking the efficiency challenges incurred by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments performed on $10$ publicly available datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the FormerTime compared to previous competitive baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on incorporating temporal hierarchical attention mechanisms, here are some key points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Methods for Incorporating Temporal Information into Attention\n\n### Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Attention\nThe work on hierarchical spatial-temporal interactive learning suggests that incorporating attention mechanisms in both spatial and temporal domains can be highly effective. For instance, the \"Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal\" model introduces attention mechanisms in time modeling, which helps the model adapt to various temporal patterns.\n\n### Time-Aware Attention Mechanisms\nThe \"TimeAliBi\" mechanism, inspired by ALiBi, modifies the attention mechanism to include a bias based on relative time. This approach adds a relative time matrix to the attention scores before applying the softmax function, which helps in capturing temporal dependencies effectively.\n\n## Efficiency Considerations and Computational Complexity\n\n### Adaptive Kernel Sizes and Convolutions\nThe \"Time-aware Large Kernel Convolutions\" (TaLK) method introduces adaptive convolution operations that predict the size of the summation kernel, reducing the time complexity to O(n) and making the sequence encoding process linear. This can be integrated into hierarchical structures to improve efficiency in the references provided, though not directly linked here, it is mentioned in the analysis.\n\n### Interleaved Convolutions and Data-Controlled Gating\nThe \"Hyena Hierarchy\" model uses interleaved implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, which matches attention-based models while being twice as fast at sequence length 8K. This approach can be combined with hierarchical processing to reduce computational overhead in the analysis.\n\n## Integration with Hierarchical Structures\n\n### Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Architectures\nModels like the \"Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder with Multi-modal Attention\" and \"Seq2Seq with Hierarchical Attention\" demonstrate how hierarchical structures can be integrated with attention mechanisms to focus on different modalities and capture complex relationships. These architectures can be adapted to incorporate temporal awareness by integrating time-aware attention mechanisms.\n\n### Temporal Intent Modeling\nThe \"Temporal Intent Modelling with Synchronized Context Encodings\" approach uses a hierarchical architecture with self-attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between features and temporal dependencies in sequential data. This can be a blueprint for integrating temporal awareness into hierarchical structures in language models.\n\n## Performance Comparisons with Traditional Attention\n\n### State Space Models\nState space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms. The analysis suggests that SSMs can provide better performance in capturing long-range dependencies and temporal patterns, with data-dependent generalization bounds showing an interplay between SSM parameters and temporal dependencies of the training sequences in the analysis.\n\n### Hybrid Approaches\nCombining multiple efficient mechanisms, such as weight-tying filters, selective computation, and dynamic routing based on input complexity, can improve both efficiency and effectiveness. For example, the \"Laughing Hyena Distillery\" approach achieves higher pre-training quality and reduces the number of filters by weight-tying across channels in the analysis.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that:\n\n- Incorporate temporal information through time-aware attention mechanisms.\n- Optimize efficiency using adaptive kernel sizes, interleaved convolutions, and data-controlled gating.\n- Utilize hierarchical structures to capture complex relationships and temporal dependencies.\n- Improve performance by leveraging state space models and hybrid approaches.\n\nThis holistic approach can help in achieving better overall performance, scalability, and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/32 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIt is worth noting that their complexity is essentially quadratic, and the corresponding linear versions both suffer performance degradation (see Fig. 1 left). While it is true that the simple use of a chunk linearization strategy can rival the speed of SSMs, the drop in performance is significant. We, therefore, abandon this strategy and the softmax function to accelerate the linear attention operations of the kernel-based approach. In addition, long convolution (Fu et al., 2023b) is more efficient and easier to implement than the traditional SSMs. We believe combining these two modules could release the true power of the hybrid model with faster speed and better performance. However, the existence of such a dilemma is worth considering: (1) the linear attention in hybrid models is a speed bottleneck for long convolution, the comparison is shown in Fig. 1 right; (2) the instability of long convolution makes attention hard to optimize. Specifically, due to the intense memory access (I/O) on the GPU and cumulative summation (cumsum) operation in a casual setting,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-02.jpg?height=550&width=1454&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=300)\n\nFigure 1. Demonstration of (left) comparison of various popular models on the Long Range Arena Dataset, and (right) speed benchmark on different implementations of attentions. Figure left, despite showing promising performance of SSM-Attention models, the linear version of these models degenerated. Figure right benchmarks attention speed with around 200 M parameters, showing linear attention is not linear with sequence length and is significantly slower than S 4 , which can be a speed bottleneck in these hybrid designs. the notable reduction in complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ in linear attention is only theoretical (Qin et al., 2024); On the other hand, the long convolution needs hand-crafted regularizations to prevent over-fitting high-frequency noise. To escape the dilemma, we have developed a novel model called CHELA, which stands for short-long Convolutional with Hardware-Efficient $\\underline{\\text { Linear }} \\underline{\\text { Attention. This model is }}$ designed to effectively and efficiently capture complex dependencies in long inputs. Inspired by FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), the model comprises multiple layers of real linear token mixers with hardware-friendly implementation with a gating mechanism that achieves comparable performance to full attention. We have added a stabilizer, reparameterizable (Ding et al., 2022; 2023) short-long convolutions, to the bottom layer of the long convolution to integrate multiple frequencies with inputs. As a result, the top layers of CHELA capture more refined data-dependent information using linear attention, while the convolutions add a structural bias that enhances global abstraction in multi-level frequencies. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CHELA on various datasets and tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020b), which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, CHELA is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer but also yields better performance. In all the settings, CHELA outperforms the baselines. Finally, we provide further analysis and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness. Our contribution can be summarized in three folds:\n\n- Efficient Implementation: We release the potential speed of linear attention in the attention-ssm hybrid model, maintaining a constant rate regardless of sequence length with fixed memory. - New Design: We improve multi-frequency learning with multi-level convolutional hierarchies, leading to better performance and stability for long convolution. - Promising Results: By connecting the above two basic modules, we propose CHELA for efficient long sequence learners are capable of both global information abstraction and fine-grained data-dependent selection.\n```\n\n#### 3.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths.

(LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 5. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient linear attention implementation hardware\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Gross*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparsely-connected neural networks are proposed, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets while proposing an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely- connected networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently deep neural networks have received considerable attention due to their ability to extract and represent high-level abstractions in data sets. Deep neural networks such as fully-connected and convolutional neural networks have shown excellent performance on a wide range of recognition and classification tasks. However, their hardware implementations currently suffer from large silicon area and high power consumption due to the their high degree of complexity. The power/energy consumption of neural networks is dominated by memory accesses, the majority of which occur in fully-connected networks. In fact, they contain most of the deep neural network parameters. In this paper, we propose sparsely-connected networks, by showing that the number of connections in fully-connected networks can be reduced by up to 90% while improving the accuracy performance on three popular datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10 and SVHN). We then propose an efficient hardware architecture based on linear-feedback shift registers to reduce the memory requirements of the proposed sparsely-connected networks. The proposed architecture can save up to 90% of memory compared to the conventional implementations of fully-connected neural networks. Moreover, implementation results show up to 84% reduction in the energy consumption of a single neuron of the proposed sparsely-connected networks compared to a single neuron of fully-connected neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Hutchins, Imanol Schlag, Yuhuai Wu, Ethan Dyer, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the Block-Recurrent Transformer, which applies a transformer layer in a recurrent fashion along a sequence, and has linear complexity with respect to sequence length. Our recurrent cell operates on blocks of tokens rather than single tokens during training, and leverages parallel computation within a block in order to make efficient use of accelerator hardware. The cell itself is strikingly simple. It is merely a transformer layer: it uses self-attention and cross-attention to efficiently compute a recurrent function over a large set of state vectors and tokens. Our design was inspired in part by LSTM cells, and it uses LSTM-style gates, but it scales the typical LSTM cell up by several orders of magnitude. Our implementation of recurrence has the same cost in both computation time and parameter count as a conventional transformer layer, but offers dramatically improved perplexity in language modeling tasks over very long sequences. Our model out-performs a long-range Transformer XL baseline by a wide margin, while running twice as fast. We demonstrate its effectiveness on PG19 (books), arXiv papers, and GitHub source code.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient linear attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient linear attention implementation hardware*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

This approach allows for linear-time inference complexity and efficient parallel training, making it competitive with traditional softmax attention models. GLA uses a structured gating mechanism to modulate the contribution of past states, which improves performance on long sequences and reduces the need for extensive training from scratch.\n\n2. **FLASHLINEARATTENTION:**\n   This implementation optimizes linear attention by trading off memory movement against parallelizability. It is faster than other linear attention implementations, even on short sequence lengths, and generalizes well to longer sequences without significant perplexity degradation.\n\n### Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n1. **Chunk-wise Computation:**\n   GLA leverages chunk-wise computation to enhance hardware efficiency. By imposing structure on the gating term, it enables higher inference throughput compared to similar-sized transformer models on long sequences.\n\n2. **Memory Access Patterns and Caching:**\n   Efficient implementations like GLA and FLASHLINEARATTENTION focus on optimizing memory access patterns. For example, GLA uses a constant memory footprint and avoids the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, making it more suitable for hardware with limited resources.\n\n3. **Hardware-Aware Sparse Attention:**\n   The S2-Attention architecture optimizes sparse attention by sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads. This approach ensures that each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context, and is designed with hardware and software systems in mind to maximize parallelization and efficient memory access.\n\n### Performance Comparisons with Traditional Attention\n\n1. **Performance Against Traditional Transformers:**\n   GLA Transformers have been shown to perform competitively against traditional transformer models like LLaMA and other linear-time-inference baselines. GLA achieves state-of-the-art results in linear-complexity language modeling and matches or surpasses traditional transformers in some tasks, especially on long sequences.\n\n2. **Efficiency Gains:**\n   The FLASHLINEARATTENTION and GLA implementations demonstrate significant efficiency gains. For instance, GLA enables higher inference throughput and reduces the computational load compared to traditional attention mechanisms, making it particularly effective for tasks like audio modeling and on-device applications.\n\n3. **Hybrid Approaches:**\n   Combining sparse and dense attention, as proposed in the S2-Attention architecture, balances efficiency and performance. This hybrid approach achieves strong performance on challenging long-context tasks while maintaining efficient memory access and computation.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n1. **L-Mul Algorithm:**\n   While not directly related to linear attention, the L-Mul algorithm, which approximates floating-point multiplications using integer addition, can significantly reduce computational resources and energy consumption. Integrating such algorithms into the broader architecture could further enhance efficiency.\n\n2. **Specialized Hardware:**\n   The development of specialized hardware, such as that proposed for the L-Mul algorithm, can further optimize the performance of efficient linear attention mechanisms. This co-design approach between algorithms and hardware can lead to substantial efficiency and performance improvements.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the benefits of linear attention mechanisms while optimizing for hardware efficiency and performance.\n",

In particular, Bahdanau et al. (2015); Cho et al. (2014); Vaswani et al. (2017) relied on attention to drastically improve the state-of-the art in machine translation. Subsequent research (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) demonstrated the power of\n\n[^0]self-attention in learning powerful representations of language to address several natural language processing tasks. Self-attention also brought impressive progress for generative modeling outside of language, e.g. image (Parmar et al., 2018; Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2018; Child et al., 2019) and music generation (Huang et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019). Self-attention operates over sequences in a stepwise manner: at every time-step, attention assigns an attention weight to each previous input element (representation of past time-steps) and uses these weights to compute the representation of the current time-step as a weighted sum of the past input elements (Vaswani et al., 2017). Self-attention (Shaw et al., 2018) is a particular case of attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Self-attention is commonly used in autoregressive generative models. These models generate observations step-by-step, modeling the probability of the next symbol given the previously generated ones. At every time step, self-attentive generative models can directly focus on any part of the previous context. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have direct interactions with only a local neighborhood of context around the current time step. This advantage however comes at a price: unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, the time and space complexity of self-attention is quadratic in $n$, the length of the sequence. Specifically, for every position $i \\leq n$, self-attention computes weights for its whole context of length $i$, which induces a complexity of $\\sum_{i \\leq n} i=n(n-1) / 2$. This makes it difficult to scale attention based models to modeling long sequences. However, long sequences are the norm in many domains, including music, image, speech, video generation and document level machine translation. Therefore, an important research direction is to investigate sparse and memory efficient forms of attention in order to scale to tasks with large sequence lengths. Previous work has proposed data independent or fixed sparsity patterns bounding temporal\ndependencies, such as local or strided attention. At each time step, the model attends only to a fixed number of time steps in the past (Child et al., 2019). Extensions to local attention have suggested learning the length of the temporal sparsity for each attention module in the network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These strategies draw their inspiration from RNNs and CNNs and bound their complexity by attending only to representations summarizing a local neighborhood of the current time step. Their attention matrices (matrices containing the attention weights for every pair of previous, current timestep) are natively sparse and require instantiating only non-zero entries. While these approaches have achieved good results, fixing the sparsity pattern of a content based mechanism such as self-attention can limit its ability to pool in information from large contexts. As an alternative to local attention, Correia et al. (2019) consider content-based sparsity, an approach allowing for arbitrary sparsity patterns. This formulation however does require instantiating a full dense attention matrix prior to sparsification through variants of $L_{0}$-sparsity or sparsemax approximations (Blondel et al., 2019). The present work builds upon these two lines of research and proposes to retain the modeling flexibility of content-based sparse attention while leveraging the efficiency of natively sparse attention matrices. Our formulation avoids sparsemax variants and relies on clustering of attention instead. Each attention module considers a clustering of the space: the current time-step only attends to context belonging to the same cluster. In other words, the current time-step query is routed to a limited number of context elements through its cluster assignment. This strategy draws inspiration from the application of spherical $k$-means clustering to the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Our proposed model, Routing Transformer, combines our efficient clustering-based sparse attention with classical local attention to reach excellent performance both for language and image generation.\n```\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

S2GSL: Incorporating Segment to Syntactic Enhanced Graph Structure Learning for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Bingfeng Chen, Qihan Ouyang, Yongqi Luo, Boyan Xu, Ruichu Cai, Zhifeng Hao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a self-adaptive aggregation network that facilitates the fusion of two graph learning branches, thereby achieving complementarity across diverse structures and demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework.\n\n**Abstract:** Previous graph-based approaches in Aspect based Sentiment Analysis(ABSA) have demonstrated impressive performance by utilizing graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn structures of static dependency trees and dynamic latent trees. However, incorporating both semantic and syntactic information simultaneously within complex global structures can introduce irrelevant contexts and syntactic dependencies during the process of graph structure learning, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions. In order to address the issues above, we propose S$^2$GSL, incorporating Segment to Syntactic enhanced Graph Structure Learning for ABSA. Specifically,S$^2$GSL is featured with a segment-aware semantic graph learning and a syntax-based latent graph learning enabling the removal of irrelevant contexts and dependencies, respectively. We further propose a self-adaptive aggregation network that facilitates the fusion of two graph learning branches, thereby achieving complementarity across diverse structures.

Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AEROGNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64). On 9 out of 12 node classification benchmarks, AERO-GNN outperforms the baseline GNNs, highlighting the advantages of deep graph attention.

Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Selective Kernel Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xiang Li, Jian Yang, Xiaolin Hu, Wenhai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive fields of\nartificial neurons in each layer are designed to share the same size. It is\nwell-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of\nvisual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely\nconsidered in constructing CNNs. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in\nCNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size\nbased on multiple scales of input information. A building block called\nSelective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with\ndifferent kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the\ninformation in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield\ndifferent sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion\nlayer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel\nNetworks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show\nthat SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower\nmodel complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture\ntarget objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons\nfor adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.\nThe code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/SKNet.\n\n**Conference:** selective-kernel-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems,\nwhich seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of\nactions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches\nhave proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nMarkov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of\njust their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for\nlonger-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods\nperform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,\nwhile RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is\naffordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a\nself-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture\nlong-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its\npredictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,\nSASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action\nhistory, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies\nshow that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models\n(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.\nMoreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable\nCNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our\nmodel adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful\npatterns in activity sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. Predicting Temporal Sets with Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Hui Xiong, Weifeng Lv, Le Yu, Bowen Du, Leilei Sun, Chuanren Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Given a sequence of sets, where each set contains an arbitrary number of elements, the problem of temporal sets prediction aims to predict the elements in the subsequent set. In practice, temporal sets prediction is much more complex than predictive modelling of temporal events and time series, and is still an open problem. Many possible existing methods, if adapted for the problem of temporal sets prediction, usually follow a two-step strategy by first projecting temporal sets into latent representations and then learning a predictive model with the latent representations. The two-step approach often leads to information loss and unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose an integrated solution based on the deep neural networks for temporal sets prediction. A unique perspective of our approach is to learn element relationship by constructing set-level co-occurrence graph and then perform graph convolutions on the dynamic relationship graphs. Moreover, we design an attention-based module to adaptively learn the temporal dependency of elements and sets. Finally, we provide a gated updating mechanism to find the hidden shared patterns in different sequences and fuse both static and dynamic information to improve the prediction performance. Experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach can achieve competitive performances even with a portion of the training data and can outperform existing methods with a significant margin.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on dynamic and adaptive attention mechanisms, here are some key points and techniques that can be considered:\n\n## Methods for Dynamic Adaptation of Attention Patterns\n\n### Self-Attention Mechanisms\nSelf-attention mechanisms, as used in Transformer models, allow for dynamic adaptation of attention patterns by computing attention scores for all elements in the input sequence simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of query, key, and value matrices derived from the same input, enabling the model to focus on different aspects of the input based on their relevance.\n\n### Multi-Head Attention\nMulti-head attention, a component of Transformer models, allows the model to capture various representations of the input data by applying multiple attention heads. Each head learns to focus on different aspects of the input, enhancing the model's ability to adapt attention patterns dynamically.\n\n### Feature-Based Attention\nFeature-based attention mechanisms, such as those described in the Feature Similarity Gain Model (FSGM), modulate neural activity based on the selectivity of neurons for specific features. This approach can be adapted to dynamically adjust attention based on the relevance of different features in the input data.\n\n## Techniques for Content-Dependent Attention Routing\n\n### Channel and Spatial Attention\nThe Channel and Spatial Attention Mechanism (CBAM), used in some neural networks, involves two consecutive sub-modules: channel attention and spatial attention. This mechanism refines feature maps by successively passing the input through these modules, allowing for content-dependent attention routing.\n\n### Dynamic Contextualization\nSelf-attention mechanisms provide dynamic contextualization by computing attention scores for all elements in the input sequence simultaneously. This allows the model to adjust its attention based on the context and relevance of different elements in the input.\n\n## Integration with Hierarchical Structures\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical processing can be integrated with attention mechanisms by using hybrid approaches that combine different attention mechanisms at various levels of the network. For example, using self-attention within blocks and linear attention for inter-block interactions can enhance both performance and efficiency.\n\n### Divide-and-Conquer Strategies\nDivide-and-conquer strategies, such as those used in Lightning Attention and CHELA, can be applied to hierarchical structures. These strategies involve handling intra-block and inter-block components separately, which can be particularly effective in hierarchical models where different levels may require different attention mechanisms.\n\n## Performance and Efficiency Trade-Offs\n\n### Efficient Linear Attention\nTechniques like Lightning Attention and CHELA implement linear attention in a hardware-efficient manner, using tiling and divide-and-conquer strategies to optimize performance. These methods balance the trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency, making them suitable for large-scale models.\n\n### Memory Access and Caching\nOptimizing memory access patterns and caching strategies is crucial for the practical performance of attention mechanisms. IO-aware implementations and careful management of memory movement can significantly impact the efficiency of the model.\n\n### Gated Mechanisms\nGated linear attention mechanisms can enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficiency. These mechanisms trade off memory movement against parallelizability, making them faster and more efficient in practice.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only highly performant but also efficient and scalable:\n\n- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Utilize self-attention and multi-head attention to dynamically adjust attention patterns based on input relevance.\n- **Content-Dependent Routing**: Implement CBAM or similar mechanisms to refine feature maps based on content.\n- **Hierarchical Integration**: Use hybrid approaches combining different attention mechanisms at various hierarchical levels.\n- **Efficiency**: Employ efficient linear attention techniques, optimize memory access, and use gated mechanisms to balance performance and efficiency.\n\nThese approaches align with the insights from the analysis of the HieraNorm-AttnGPT design, emphasizing the importance of efficient implementation, hierarchical processing, and careful balance between complexity and efficiency.\n",

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d.

Other Routing Transformer models are faster while still matching full attention, e.g., 2 routing layers with 4 routing heads trains at 7.409 steps per second. Therefore, Local Transformer is roughly between $1.22-1.76 \\times$ faster than the best performing Routing Transformers. On the other hand Transformer is between $0.76-1.09 \\times$ faster than the best Routing Transformers. On PG-19, we see from Table 7, that the Local Transformer is roughly $1.7 \\times$ faster compared to the Routing Transformer, similar to the trend on CIFAR-10. This trade-off with respect to speed compared to the Local Transformer is due to the lack of support for sparse operations on the TPU; on the GPU various sparse kernels have been proposed which promise to significantly speed up training of these models (Gale et al., 2020). Note that our goal in this work is a memory efficient version of sparse attention that can well approximate full attention for long sequences - wall-clock time efficiency is only a secondary goal. ## 7 Conclusion\n\nTransformer models constitutes the state-of-the-art in auto-regressive generative models for sequential data. Their space-time complexity is however quadratic in sequence length, due to their attention modules. Our work proposes a sparse attention model, the Routing Transformer. It relies on content-based sparse attention motivated by nonnegative matrix factorization. Compared with local attention models, it does not require fixed attention patterns but enjoys similar space-time complexity. In contrast with prior work on content-based sparse attention, it does not require computing a full attention matrix but still selects sparsity patterns based on content similarity. Our experiments over text and image generation draw two main conclusions. First, we show that a scaled up version of local attention establishes a strong baseline on modern benchmark, even compared to recent state-of-the-art models. Second, we show that the Routing Transformer redefines the state-of-the-art in large long sequence benchmarks of Wikitext-103, PG-19 and ImageNet-64, while being very close to do so on enwik-8 as well. Our analysis also shows that routing attention modules offer complementary attention patterns when compared to local attention. Overall, our work contributes an efficient attention mechanism that applies to the modeling of long sequences and redefines the state of the art for auto-regressive generative modeling. Our approach could prove useful in domains where the inputs are naturally sparse, such as 3D point clouds, social networks, or protein interactions. ## 8 Acknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Phillip Wang and Aran Komatsuzaki for a Pytorch implementation of\n\nRouting Transformer.

In particular, Bahdanau et al. (2015); Cho et al. (2014); Vaswani et al. (2017) relied on attention to drastically improve the state-of-the art in machine translation. Subsequent research (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) demonstrated the power of\n\n[^0]self-attention in learning powerful representations of language to address several natural language processing tasks. Self-attention also brought impressive progress for generative modeling outside of language, e.g. image (Parmar et al., 2018; Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2018; Child et al., 2019) and music generation (Huang et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019). Self-attention operates over sequences in a stepwise manner: at every time-step, attention assigns an attention weight to each previous input element (representation of past time-steps) and uses these weights to compute the representation of the current time-step as a weighted sum of the past input elements (Vaswani et al., 2017). Self-attention (Shaw et al., 2018) is a particular case of attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Self-attention is commonly used in autoregressive generative models. These models generate observations step-by-step, modeling the probability of the next symbol given the previously generated ones. At every time step, self-attentive generative models can directly focus on any part of the previous context. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have direct interactions with only a local neighborhood of context around the current time step. This advantage however comes at a price: unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, the time and space complexity of self-attention is quadratic in $n$, the length of the sequence. Specifically, for every position $i \\leq n$, self-attention computes weights for its whole context of length $i$, which induces a complexity of $\\sum_{i \\leq n} i=n(n-1) / 2$. This makes it difficult to scale attention based models to modeling long sequences. However, long sequences are the norm in many domains, including music, image, speech, video generation and document level machine translation. Therefore, an important research direction is to investigate sparse and memory efficient forms of attention in order to scale to tasks with large sequence lengths. Previous work has proposed data independent or fixed sparsity patterns bounding temporal\ndependencies, such as local or strided attention. At each time step, the model attends only to a fixed number of time steps in the past (Child et al., 2019). Extensions to local attention have suggested learning the length of the temporal sparsity for each attention module in the network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These strategies draw their inspiration from RNNs and CNNs and bound their complexity by attending only to representations summarizing a local neighborhood of the current time step. Their attention matrices (matrices containing the attention weights for every pair of previous, current timestep) are natively sparse and require instantiating only non-zero entries. While these approaches have achieved good results, fixing the sparsity pattern of a content based mechanism such as self-attention can limit its ability to pool in information from large contexts. As an alternative to local attention, Correia et al. (2019) consider content-based sparsity, an approach allowing for arbitrary sparsity patterns. This formulation however does require instantiating a full dense attention matrix prior to sparsification through variants of $L_{0}$-sparsity or sparsemax approximations (Blondel et al., 2019). The present work builds upon these two lines of research and proposes to retain the modeling flexibility of content-based sparse attention while leveraging the efficiency of natively sparse attention matrices. Our formulation avoids sparsemax variants and relies on clustering of attention instead. Each attention module considers a clustering of the space: the current time-step only attends to context belonging to the same cluster. In other words, the current time-step query is routed to a limited number of context elements through its cluster assignment. This strategy draws inspiration from the application of spherical $k$-means clustering to the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Our proposed model, Routing Transformer, combines our efficient clustering-based sparse attention with classical local attention to reach excellent performance both for language and image generation.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Mixture of Attention Heads: Selecting Attention Heads Per Token\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Xiaofeng Zhang, Yikang Shen, Zeyu Huang, Jie Zhou, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism, is proposed, which can easily scale up the number of attention heads and theNumber of parameters while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks have been proposed as an efficient way to scale up model capacity and implement conditional computing. However, the study of MoE components mostly focused on the feedforward layer in Transformer architecture. This paper proposes the Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism. MoA includes a set of attention heads that each has its own set of parameters. Given an input, a router dynamically selects a subset of k attention heads per token. This conditional computation schema allows MoA to achieve stronger performance than the standard multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, the sparsely gated MoA can easily scale up the number of attention heads and the number of parameters while preserving computational efficiency. Despite performance improvements, MoA also automatically differentiates heads\u2019 utilities, providing a new perspective to discuss the model\u2019s interpretability. We conducted experiments on several important tasks, including Machine Translation and Masked Language Modeling. Experiments have shown promising results on several tasks against strong baselines that involve large and very deep models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Space and Time Continuous Physics Simulation From Partial Observations\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Steeven Janny, Madiha Nadri Wolf, Julie Digne, Christian Wolf*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern techniques for physical simulations rely on numerical schemes and mesh-refinement methods to address trade-offs between precision and complexity, but these handcrafted solutions are tedious and require high computational power. Data-driven methods based on large-scale machine learning promise high adaptivity by integrating long-range dependencies more directly and efficiently. In this work, we focus on fluid dynamics and address the shortcomings of a large part of the literature, which are based on fixed support for computations and predictions in the form of regular or irregular grids. We propose a novel setup to perform predictions in a continuous spatial and temporal domain while being trained on sparse observations. We formulate the task as a double observation problem and propose a solution with two interlinked dynamical systems defined on, respectively, the sparse positions and the continuous domain, which allows to forecast and interpolate a solution from the initial condition. Our practical implementation involves recurrent GNNs and a spatio-temporal attention observer capable of interpolating the solution at arbitrary locations. Our model not only generalizes to new initial conditions (as standard auto-regressive models do) but also performs evaluation at arbitrary space and time locations. We evaluate on three standard datasets in fluid dynamics and compare to strong baselines, which are outperformed both in classical settings and in the extended new task requiring continuous predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 106  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. Powerpropagation: A sparsity inducing weight reparameterisation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Jonathan Schwarz, Siddhant M. Jayakumar, Razvan Pascanu, P. Latham, Y. Teh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Powerpropagation, a new weight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse models and advocates the use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed representations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model capacity.\n\n**Abstract:** The training of sparse neural networks is becoming an increasingly important tool for reducing the computational footprint of models at training and evaluation, as well enabling the effective scaling up of models. Whereas much work over the years has been dedicated to specialised pruning techniques, little attention has been paid to the inherent effect of gradient based training on model sparsity. In this work, we introduce Powerpropagation, a new weight-parameterisation for neural networks that leads to inherently sparse models. Exploiting the behaviour of gradient descent, our method gives rise to weight updates exhibiting a\"rich get richer\"dynamic, leaving low-magnitude parameters largely unaffected by learning. Models trained in this manner exhibit similar performance, but have a distribution with markedly higher density at zero, allowing more parameters to be pruned safely. Powerpropagation is general, intuitive, cheap and straight-forward to implement and can readily be combined with various other techniques. To highlight its versatility, we explore it in two very different settings: Firstly, following a recent line of work, we investigate its effect on sparse training for resource-constrained settings. Here, we combine Powerpropagation with a traditional weight-pruning technique as well as recent state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse algorithms, showing superior performance on the ImageNet benchmark. Secondly, we advocate the use of sparsity in overcoming catastrophic forgetting, where compressed representations allow accommodating a large number of tasks at fixed model capacity. In all cases our reparameterisation considerably increases the efficacy of the off-the-shelf methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hard-Attention Gates with Gradient Routing for Endoscopic Image Computing\n\n*From Search Query: sparse routing attention implementation techniques*\n\n*Andrea Cherubini, Pietro Salvagnini, Carlo Biffi, Giorgio Roffo*\n\n**Abstract:** To address overfitting and enhance model generalization in gastroenterological polyp size assessment, our study introduces Feature-Selection Gates (FSG) or Hard-Attention Gates (HAG) alongside Gradient Routing (GR) for dynamic feature selection. This technique aims to boost Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) by promoting sparse connectivity, thereby reducing overfitting and enhancing generalization. HAG achieves this through sparsification with learnable weights, serving as a regularization strategy. GR further refines this process by optimizing HAG parameters via dual forward passes, independently from the main model, to improve feature re-weighting. Our evaluation spanned multiple datasets, including CIFAR-100 for a broad impact assessment and specialized endoscopic datasets (REAL-Colon, Misawa, and SUN) focusing on polyp size estimation, covering over 200 polyps in more than 370,000 frames. The findings indicate that our HAG-enhanced networks substantially enhance performance in both binary and triclass classification tasks related to polyp sizing. Specifically, CNNs experienced an F1 Score improvement to 87.8% in binary classification, while in triclass classification, the ViT-T model reached an F1 Score of 76.5%, outperforming traditional CNNs and ViT-T models. To facilitate further research, we are releasing our codebase, which includes implementations for CNNs, multistream CNNs, ViT, and HAG-augmented variants. This resource aims to standardize the use of endoscopic datasets, providing public training-validation-testing splits for reliable and comparable research in gastroenterological polyp size estimation.

This approach reduces computational costs by leveraging conditional computation and avoids dense matrix multiplications.\n- Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, particularly those using sparse layers, can be integrated into attention mechanisms. These models activate only a subset of experts for a given input, which can be optimized using techniques like KeepTopK and auxiliary loss functions to ensure uniform routing across experts.\n\n### Content-Based Sparse Attention\n- Dynamic sparse attention patterns can be learned to avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This combines the flexibility of content-based sparse attention with the efficiency of local, temporal sparse attention.\n\n### Online K-Means Clustering\n- The Routing Transformer uses online k-means clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from \\(O(n^2 d)\\) to \\(O(n^{1.5} d)\\), providing a balance between flexibility and computational efficiency.\n\n## Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Conditional Computation\n- Switch SAEs and MoE models use conditional computation to route inputs to specific experts, reducing the need for dense matrix multiplications and thus optimizing memory usage.\n\n### Tiling and Divide-and-Conquer Strategies\n- Techniques like tiling and divide-and-conquer can be applied to attention mechanisms to optimize memory access patterns. For example, Lightning Attention-2 separates intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculations, which helps in efficient memory utilization.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Approaches\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Attention Approximations\n- Efficient transformers use attention approximation methods such as sparse, low-rank, and softmax-free attention to extend the context length that can be processed. These methods can be combined with hardware-efficient implementations like FlashAttention and quantization to optimize performance.\n\n### Position Encoding and Interpolation\n- Position encoding techniques like RoPE and position interpolation can be used to improve the model's understanding of sequential structures without significantly increasing computational costs. These methods can be optimized for hardware efficiency by leveraging tensorization and other approximation techniques.\n\n## Performance Comparisons with Dense Attention\n\n### Efficiency and Effectiveness\n- Sparse attention models, such as the Routing Transformer and Lightning Attention-2, have been shown to outperform comparable dense attention models in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance. These models achieve this by reducing the overall complexity of attention calculations.\n\n### Pareto Improvement\n- Switch SAEs deliver a substantial Pareto improvement in the reconstruction vs. sparsity frontier compared to other SAE architectures, indicating that sparse routing attention can achieve better performance with reduced computational costs.\n\nIn summary, integrating sparse routing mechanisms with hierarchical structures, using techniques like online k-means clustering, and optimizing memory access patterns through tiling and divide-and-conquer strategies can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models. Additionally, leveraging hardware-efficient attention approximations and position encoding techniques can further enhance the model's scalability and effectiveness.\n",

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/27 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nAlong this line, previous studies mainly investigated from the model expressivity and training stability perspectives. On the one hand, Dong et al. [6] and Noci et al. [19] initiated the discussion of attention localization and theoretically showed that a network with self-attention layers without skip connections exponentially loses the rank of hidden layers; the fact indicates that the model expressivity shall be immediately lost with more self-attention layers stacked. On the other hand, Zhai et al. [31] empirically found that attention entropy-averaged Shannon entropy of an attention probability matrix-correlates with training stability. Specifically, a training loss curve tends to fall into a plateau when attention entropy is low. Since higher entropy indicates near-uniform attention weights, their finding apparently suggests that localized attention may lead the learning dynamics to a plateau. Up until now, these two failure modes have been discussed independently with slightly different notions of attention localization, and hence, our understanding of the blessing and curse of attention localization remains elusive. To better comprehend, we characterize self-attention patterns by attention parameter matrices to reconcile the two collapse modes. We formulate the concept of localization by signal propagation probability (Section 3), which describes how likely the signal of a specific input token propagates to the gradient of a training objective. If the signal propagation probability is high for a few numbers of tokens only, attention is regarded to be localized. We show that the localization mode can be characterized by the eigenspectrum of attention weight matrices (Section 4). Specifically, attention is localized in the above sense when the eigenspectrum of the query-key parameter matrix has a non-zero mean and a small variance. Furthermore, the small eigenspectrum variance is relevant to both the rank collapse and entropy collapse (Section 5), and thus, we give a unified perspective of the two notions of attention collapse. For this reason, we argue that attention collapse and its performance can be viewed more transparently based on the eigenspectrum variance. Lastly, we verified the correlation of the eigenspectrum and the model performance in the experiments with the WikiText dataset [16] by introducing a regularization scheme called LocAteR.\n```\n\n#### 2. \u221e-former: Infinite Memory Transformer (Avg.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Stabilizing Transformer Training by Preventing Attention Entropy Collapse\n\n*From Search Query: training dynamics sparse attention stability*\n\n*Shuangfei Zhai, T. Likhomanenko, Etai Littwin, Dan Busbridge, Jason Ramapuram, Yizhe Zhang, Jiatao Gu, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: training dynamics sparse attention stability*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. JoMA: Demystifying Multilayer Transformers via JOint Dynamics of MLP and Attention\n\n*From Search Query: training dynamics sparse attention stability*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Yiping Wang, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Beidi Chen, Simon S. Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Implicit Regularization Leads to Benign Overfitting for Sparse Linear Regression\n\n*From Search Query: training dynamics sparse attention stability*\n\n*Mo Zhou, Rong Ge*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that training the new model via gradient descent leads to an interpolator with near-optimal test loss, which is another example of implicit regularization effect that goes beyond norm minimization.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, often the training process finds an interpolator (a solution with 0 training loss), but the test loss is still low. This phenomenon, known as benign overfitting, is a major mystery that received a lot of recent attention. One common mechanism for benign overfitting is implicit regularization, where the training process leads to additional properties for the interpolator, often characterized by minimizing certain norms. However, even for a simple sparse linear regression problem $y = \\beta^{*\\top} x +\\xi$ with sparse $\\beta^*$, neither minimum $\\ell_1$ or $\\ell_2$ norm interpolator gives the optimal test loss. In this work, we give a different parametrization of the model which leads to a new implicit regularization effect that combines the benefit of $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ interpolators. We show that training our new model via gradient descent leads to an interpolator with near-optimal test loss. Our result is based on careful analysis of the training dynamics and provides another example of implicit regularization effect that goes beyond norm minimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Existing training objectives for GFlowNets are either local to states or transitions, or propagate a reward signal over an entire sampling trajectory. We argue that these alternatives represent opposite ends of a gradient bias-variance tradeoff and propose a way to exploit this tradeoff to mitigate its harmful effects. Inspired by the TD($\\lambda$) algorithm in reinforcement learning, we introduce subtrajectory balance or SubTB($\\lambda$), a GFlowNet training objective that can learn from partial action subsequences of varying lengths. We show that SubTB($\\lambda$) accelerates sampler convergence in previously studied and new environments and enables training GFlowNets in environments with longer action sequences and sparser reward landscapes than what was possible before. We also perform a comparative analysis of stochastic gradient dynamics, shedding light on the bias-variance tradeoff in GFlowNet training and the advantages of subtrajectory balance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 73  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. From Peptides to Nanostructures: A Euclidean Transformer for Fast and Stable Machine Learned Force Fields\n\n*From Search Query: training dynamics sparse attention stability*\n\n*Stefan Chmiela, Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller, Oliver T. Unke, J. Thorben Frank*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent years have seen vast progress in the development of machine learned force fields (MLFFs) based on ab-initio reference calculations. Despite achieving low test errors, the reliability of MLFFs in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is facing growing scrutiny due to concerns about instability over extended simulation timescales. Our findings suggest a potential connection between robustness to cumulative inaccuracies and the use of equivariant representations in MLFFs, but the computational cost associated with these representations can limit this advantage in practice. To address this, we propose a transformer architecture called SO3krates that combines sparse equivariant representations (Euclidean variables) with a self-attention mechanism that separates invariant and equivariant information, eliminating the need for expensive tensor products. SO3krates achieves a unique combination of accuracy, stability, and speed that enables insightful analysis of quantum properties of matter on extended time and system size scales. To showcase this capability, we generate stable MD trajectories for flexible peptides and supra-molecular structures with hundreds of atoms. Furthermore, we investigate the PES topology for medium-sized chainlike molecules (e.g., small peptides) by exploring thousands of minima. Remarkably, SO3krates demonstrates the ability to strike a balance between the conflicting demands of stability and the emergence of new minimum-energy conformations beyond the training data, which is crucial for realistic exploration tasks in the field of biochemistry.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on training dynamics, stability analysis, convergence properties, and initialization strategies for sparse attention models, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Training Dynamics and Stability Analysis of Sparse Attention Models\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This method introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that adapts to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios. It uses a gating network to select significant blocks in the attention map, balancing accuracy and speed. The paper discusses the training dynamics and stability of this approach, showing that SeerAttention outperforms static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods with minimal perplexity loss and significant speedup.\n\n- **Differential Transformer (DIFF Transformer)**: This model employs a differential attention mechanism that computes attention scores by subtracting two distinct softmax attention maps, effectively reducing noise and enhancing focus on pertinent context. While it improves performance and stability, especially in long-context modeling and in-context learning, it also highlights the need for careful consideration of the increased computational burden.\n\n## Convergence Properties of Hierarchical Attention\n\n- The **SeerAttention** paper does not explicitly discuss convergence properties, but it does show that the model can achieve high sparsity ratios (up to 90%) with minimal perplexity loss, indicating stable and efficient training dynamics.\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: The convergence properties are implied through the model's ability to reduce hallucinations and improve accuracy in various tasks. However, the computational overhead of the differential attention mechanism could impact convergence speed.\n\n## Initialization Strategies for Clustered Attention\n\n- **ClusterFormer** and similar models are not directly discussed in the provided sources, but the concept of neural clustering integrated with self-attention suggests that initialization strategies would be crucial. Typically, careful initialization is necessary to ensure that the clustering mechanism groups words with strong dependencies effectively. This might involve initializing the clustering weights or using pre-trained models as a starting point[Analysis Note].\n\n## Gradient Flow in Sparse Attention Architectures\n\n- **SeerAttention**: The paper mentions the use of a customized FlashAttention implementation to enable efficient learning of the gating network. This implies that the gradient flow is managed to minimize overhead and ensure that the model can learn the block-level sparsity effectively.\n\n- **Differential Transformer**: The mechanism of computing attention scores by subtracting two softmax maps involves training the weights and scaling factors in parallel. This suggests that the gradient flow is specialized to handle the noise cancellation and signal preservation, which is critical for the stability and performance of the model.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: While not directly addressed in the provided sources, optimizing sparse attention models for hardware efficiency is crucial. Techniques such as tiling strategies, structured sparsity patterns, and caching can significantly improve performance[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Balance Between Sparsity and Expressiveness**: The balance between achieving sparsity and maintaining expressiveness is a key challenge. Models like SeerAttention and Differential Transformer aim to achieve this balance through adaptive and dynamic mechanisms.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can improve the training stability, convergence properties, and overall performance of autoregressive language models using sparse attention mechanisms.\n",

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/35 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nApoorv Vyas, Angelos Katharopoulos, and Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret. 2020.

Generalized Reductions: Making any Hierarchical Clustering Fair and Balanced with Low Cost\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical routing attention clustering*\n\n*Marina Knittel, John P. Dickerson, M. Hajiaghayi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work vastly improves the previous fair approximation for cost to a near polylogarithmic and establishes a cost-fairness tradeoff and extends to broader fairness constraints than the previous work.\n\n**Abstract:** Clustering is a fundamental building block of modern statistical analysis pipelines. Fair clustering has seen much attention from the machine learning community in recent years. We are some of the first to study fairness in the context of hierarchical clustering, after the results of Ahmadian et al. from NeurIPS in 2020. We evaluate our results using Dasgupta's cost function, perhaps one of the most prevalent theoretical metrics for hierarchical clustering evaluation. Our work vastly improves the previous $O(n^{5/6}poly\\log(n))$ fair approximation for cost to a near polylogarithmic $O(n^\\delta poly\\log(n))$ fair approximation for any constant $\\delta\\in(0,1)$. This result establishes a cost-fairness tradeoff and extends to broader fairness constraints than the previous work. We also show how to alter existing hierarchical clusterings to guarantee fairness and cluster balance across any level in the hierarchy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Parallel and Efficient Hierarchical k-Median Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical routing attention clustering*\n\n*Vincent Cohen-Addad, Silvio Lattanzi, A. Norouzi-Fard, C. Sohler, O. Svensson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a fundamental unsupervised learning task, hierarchical clustering has been extensively studied in the past decade. In particular, standard metric formulations as hierarchical k -center, k -means, and k -median received a lot of attention and the problems have been studied extensively in different models of computation. Despite all this interest, not many ef\ufb01cient parallel algorithms are known for these problems. In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that, when using machines with memory s (for s \u2208 \u2126(log 2 ( n + \u2206 + d )) ), outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every \ufb01xed value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution. Furthermore, we also get that in for all k simultanuously the cost of the solution is at most an expected O (min { d, log n } log \u2206 log(\u2206 dn )) factor bigger that the corresponding optimal solution. The algorithm requires in O (log s ( nd log( n + \u2206))) rounds. Here d is the dimension of the data set and \u2206 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance of two points in the input dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst parallel algorithm for the hierarchical k -median problem with theoretical guarantees. We further complement our theoretical results with an empirical study of our algorithm that shows its effectiveness in practice.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical routing attention clustering*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Routing Transformer Network for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical routing attention clustering*\n\n*Yuan Tian, Nan Xu, Ruike Zhang, W. Mao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and proposes the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net), which utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal sarcasm detection is an important research topic in natural language processing and multimedia computing, and benefits a wide range of applications in multiple domains. Most existing studies regard the incongruity between image and text as the indicative clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm. To capture cross-modal incongruity, previous methods rely on fixed architectures in network design, which restricts the model from dynamically adjusting to diverse image-text pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic network, we model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical routing attention clustering*\n\n*Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Shuang Li, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE is proposed, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learn.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention mechanisms, dynamic routing, clustering, and hardware-aware optimizations, here are some relevant findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and the detailed analysis:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms with Dynamic Routing or Clustering\n\n- The paper on \"ExpertFlow\" introduces a dynamic routing mechanism for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which is highly relevant. It discusses a transformer-based Routing Path Predictor that uses full self-attention and cross-attention to predict whether each expert is active or idle. This approach can be adapted for hierarchical attention mechanisms by integrating online clustering and dynamic cluster assignments.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Attention with Online Clustering\n\n- The \"ExpertFlow\" paper also proposes the Expert Cache Engine (ECE), which uses Predictive Locality-aware Expert Caching to improve cache hit ratios significantly. This caching strategy, combined with online clustering, could enhance memory efficiency in hierarchical attention models. The ECE strategy considers the usage patterns of experts, which can be extended to clustering-based attention mechanisms.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization of Hierarchical Neural Networks\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly address hardware-aware optimization of hierarchical neural networks, the \"ExpertFlow\" paper does discuss optimizations that reduce I/O overhead and improve computational efficiency. These strategies, such as predictive routing and strategic caching, can be generalized to optimize hardware utilization in hierarchical models.\n\n## Adaptive Computation in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The \"ExpertFlow\" system is designed to optimize memory usage and accelerate inference in MoE models, which involves adaptive computation. The use of a transformer-based predictor and a token scheduler to group tokens with similar routing paths can be applied to adaptive computation in transformer architectures, enhancing their efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Additional Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention and Clustering**: Integrating online k-means clustering with hierarchical attention, as proposed in the HieraRoute-GPT analysis, can be further explored by adapting the dynamic routing mechanisms from MoE models. This could involve using a hierarchical structure where each level of the hierarchy employs a different set of experts or clusters, optimizing both computational complexity and memory efficiency.\n\n- **Memory Efficiency Analysis**: The Expert Cache Engine (ECE) in \"ExpertFlow\" provides a robust framework for improving cache efficiency. This can be extended to hierarchical attention models by implementing similar caching strategies that consider the usage patterns of different attention heads or clusters.\n\n- **Computational Complexity Studies**: The use of transformer-based predictors and token schedulers in \"ExpertFlow\" simplifies the prediction process and reduces the resources needed for training. This approach can be studied to understand how it affects computational complexity in hierarchical attention models.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization Strategies**: While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss hardware optimization for hierarchical neural networks, the general principles of predictive routing and caching from \"ExpertFlow\" can be applied to optimize hardware utilization. Further research into hardware-aware implementations of attention models, such as those discussed in the context of MoE models, would be beneficial.\n\n### Future Search Directions\n\n- **Recent Clustering-Based Attention Mechanisms**: Search for recent papers that integrate clustering with attention mechanisms, particularly those that focus on online clustering and dynamic routing.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Investigate papers and research on hardware-aware implementations of neural networks, focusing on attention models and hierarchical architectures.\n- **Memory Optimization Techniques**: Study memory optimization techniques specifically designed for attention models, including caching strategies and efficient clustering algorithms.\n- **Scalability Analysis**: Examine scalability analyses of similar architectures to understand how they perform with larger models and longer sequence lengths.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware autoregressive language model that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms and dynamic routing with clustering.\n",

Nystr\u00f6mformer: A nystr\u00f6m-based algorithm for approximating self-attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, G. Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Hutchins, Christian Szegedy*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 138  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext, math papers, books, code, as well as formal theorems (Isabelle).\n\n**Abstract:** Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

Shifted Chunk Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Representational Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Xuefan Zha, Wentao Zhu, Tingxun Lv, Sen Yang, Ji Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks that can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip and outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches onKinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Abstract:** Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various fields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action anticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches primarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the intra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have successfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal learning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract fine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1367  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Pale Transformer: A General Vision Transformer Backbone with Pale-Shaped Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Haoru Tan, Tianyi Wu, Sitong Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Transformers have shown promising performance in various vision tasks. To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by the global self-attention, various methods constrain the range of attention within a local region to improve its efficiency. Consequently, their receptive fields in a single attention layer are not large enough, resulting in insufficient context modeling. To address this issue, we propose a Pale-Shaped self-Attention (PS-Attention), which performs self-attention within a pale-shaped region. Compared to the global self-attention, PS-Attention can reduce the computation and memory costs significantly. Meanwhile, it can capture richer contextual information under the similar computation complexity with previous local self-attention mechanisms. Based on the PS-Attention, we develop a general Vision Transformer backbone with a hierarchical architecture, named Pale Transformer, which achieves 83.4%, 84.3%, and 84.9% Top-1 accuracy with the model size of 22M, 48M, and 85M respectively for 224 ImageNet-1K classification, outperforming the previous Vision Transformer backbones. For downstream tasks, our Pale Transformer backbone performs better than the recent state-of-the-art CSWin Transformer by a large margin on ADE20K semantic segmentation and COCO object detection & instance segmentation. The code will be released on https://github.com/BR-IDL/PaddleViT.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient transformer hierarchical attention*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

It can freeze up to 95% of layers, reducing overall GPU memory usage by an average of 2.2x without significant accuracy degradation.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Memristor-Based Transformer**: The paper introduces an efficient hardware accelerator for transformer networks using memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach significantly accelerates transformer self-attention operations, reducing power consumption and latency. The hardware implementation includes optimized matrix-matrix multiplication and softmax functions using RRAM-based compare and select logics and look-up tables.\n\n## Scalability Analysis of Hierarchical Transformers\n\n- **Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)**: This approach evolves NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs improve performance and efficiency by conditioning exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices, allowing for substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks and reducing input contexts significantly.\n\n## Efficient Caching Strategies for Attention Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss caching strategies, the concept of **SlimFit** and **NAMMs** implies efficient memory management. For instance, SlimFit's dynamic layer freezing can be seen as a form of caching optimization, as it reduces the need to store and process less important layers during fine-tuning.\n- **Memristor-Based Design**: The use of memristor crossbars to store values of K and V during the inference stage can be considered an efficient caching strategy, as it leverages hardware to optimize memory usage and reduce latency.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Minimized RNNs**: Although not directly related to transformers, the concept of minimized RNNs (minLSTM and minGRU) shows that traditional models can be optimized for parallel training, which might inspire similar optimizations for transformer models. These models reduce the number of required parameters significantly and are more memory-efficient than some state-of-the-art recurrent models.\n\nTo further improve the autoregressive language model design, the researchers could:\n\n- **Integrate Clustering-Based Attention**: Implement neural clustering integrated with self-attention, as seen in ClusterFormer, to improve efficiency by grouping words with strong dependencies into the same cluster (referenced in the analysis summary).\n- **Utilize Dynamic Routing**: Incorporate dynamic path activation and hierarchical co-attention mechanisms, similar to the Dynamic Routing Transformer, to adaptively compute attention and improve scalability (referenced in the analysis summary).\n- **Leverage Hardware Optimization**: Explore memristor-based or other hardware-accelerated designs to optimize attention mechanisms and reduce computational costs.\n- **Optimize Memory Management**: Implement dynamic layer freezing and efficient caching strategies, such as those implied by SlimFit and NAMMs, to reduce memory requirements during training and inference.\n",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

This is borne out in the common task of Imagenet-64 generation, where Reformer gets around 3.65 bits/dim (Figure 3), while the Routing Transformer gets 3.43 bits/dim (see Table 4 for a comparison). Sparse Computation beyond Attention: Learning models with sparse representations/activations for saving time and computation has been addressed in the past in various context. Previous work often refers to this goal as gating for conditional computation. Gating techniques relying on sampling and straight-through gradient estimators are common (Bengio et al., 2013; Eigen et al., 2013; Cho and Bengio, 2014). Conditional computation can also be addressed with reinforcement learning (Denoyer and Gallinari, 2014; Indurthi et al., 2019). Memory augmented neural networks with sparse reads and writes have also been proposed in Rae et al. (2016) as a way to scale Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014). In the domain of language modeling, a related work is the sparsely gated Mixture-of-experts (MOE) (Shazeer et al., 2017) where sparsity is induced by experts and a trainable gating network controls the routing strategy to each sub-network. Another related work is Lample et al. (2019) who use product quantization based key-value lookups to replace the feed forward network in the Transformer. Our work differs from theirs in that we make use of dynamic key-value pairs to infer sparsity patterns, while their key-value pairs are the same across examples. ## 3 Self-Attentive Auto-regressive Sequence Modeling\n\nAuto-regressive sequence models decompose the probability of a sequence $\\mathbf{x}=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ as\n\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x})=p_{\\theta}\\left(x_{1}\\right) \\prod_{i=2}^{n} p_{\\theta}\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{<i}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn neural models, the conditional distribution $p_{\\theta}\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{<i}\\right)$ is modeled by a neural network with learned parameters $\\theta$ and these parameters are typically learned to maximize the likelihood of the training data. In particular, Transformer architectures have shown to reach state-of-the-art accuracy in several domains, including language modeling (Vaswani et al., 2017; Radford et al., 2018), image generation (Parmar et al., 2018) and music generation (Huang et al., 2018). Transformer models compose a series of attention modules. Each module refines the input representation by taking a weighted average of the representations from the previous modules. For every module, the input representation is a sequence of $n$ vectors $\\mathbf{x}=\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right)$ from a continuous space of dimension $d$. Thus one may actually treat the input sequence as a $n \\times d$ matrix $X$. A self-attention layer operates on this representation. It first applies three linear projections,\n\n$$\nQ=X W_{Q}, \\quad K=X W_{K}, \\quad V=X W_{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $Q, K$ and $V$ are referred to as keys, queries and values, while $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V}$ are learned projection matrices. The key and the query matrices determine the $n \\times n$ attention matrix $A=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)$, where the softmax operator over matrices denotes that the softmax function has been applied to each row. In the case of self-attention for auto-regressive models, queries attend only over keys from previous timesteps, i.e. $$\nA=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\operatorname{ltr}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere ltr denotes the lower triangular operator. The attention matrix $A$ may be interpreted as a matrix of weights in $[0,1]$ where $A_{i j}$ denotes how much query position $i$ at the next layer must pay attention to key position $j$ at the previous layer. Given the attention matrix $A$, the next layer representation $X^{\\prime}$ is then computed simply as $A V$. In summary,\n\n$$\nX_{i}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j<i}^{n} A_{i j} V_{j}\n$$\n\nIn practice, Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) adds several extensions to this basic self-attention mechanism. In particular, the result $X^{\\prime}$ of performing selfattention is scaled by $1 / \\sqrt{d}$. Moreover, each layer\nrelies on multiple attention heads, i.e. each layer performs multiple projections onto triplet (queries, keys, values) and attention is performed for each head. The attention results from all heads are then concatenated. This strategy allows each head to specialize on different aspects of the input sequence. In addition, Transformer further processes the result of attention through a learnable non-linear transformation (multi-layer perceptron, mlp) followed by a residual connection and a normalization step, i.e. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& X^{\\prime}=\\operatorname{layernorm}\\left(X^{\\prime}+X\\right) \\\\\n& X^{\\prime \\prime}=\\operatorname{layernorm}\\left(\\operatorname{mlp}\\left(X^{\\prime}\\right)+X\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere layernorm denotes the parameterized normalization step from (Ba et al., 2016). A full Transformer model is therefore a chain of attention modules (Eq. 6) preceded by an embedding module (learnable representation for symbols and their positions) and followed by a logistic classification module (learnable linear classifier to predict the next symbol). Our work is interested in the application of the Transformer to long sequences, a challenging problem since space and time complexity of attention is quadratic in sequence length $n$. We describe various approaches to sparse attention including ours in the next section. ## 4 Efficient Content-Dependent Sparse Attention\n\nAttention-based models can be problematic for long sequences. For a sequence of length $n$, the full attention matrix $A$, as introduced in Section 3, is $n \\times n$-dimensional and can be prohibitive to instantiate. This motivates sparse attention models, i.e. models relying on attention matrices which have a majority of zero entries. For each query, a sparse attention model defines a set of keys which can be attended to. In the following, we introduce the set $S_{i}$ as the set of key positions that the query at position $i$ can attend to, i.e. $$\nX_{i}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{j \\in S_{i}} A_{i j} V_{j}\n$$\n\nThe set of all such key positions defines a sparsity pattern $\\mathcal{S}=\\left\\{S_{i} \\mid 1 \\leq i \\leq n\\right\\}$ for the entire sequence. For example, classical causal self attention can attend to every key prior to the current query, which translates to $S_{i}=\\{j \\mid j<i\\}$ for every $i$. Most previous work on attention sparsity defined such sets purely based on positions, independently of actual query and key vectors. For example, local attention (Luong et al., 2015) considers attending only to a $k$-long time window prior to the current query, $S_{i}=\\{j \\mid i-k \\leq j<i\\}$ for every $i$. The work of Child et al. (2019) propose block sparse attention where half the heads perform local attention, and half the heads perform strided attention given by $S_{i}=\\{j \\mid i-j(\\bmod k)=0, j<i\\}$ for every $i$. The approach of Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) is also a variant of local attention where the cardinality of $\\left|S_{i}\\right|$ is learned from data with an $L_{1}$ penalty to trade-off sparsity with modeling accuracy. These local attention sparsity variants are effective in practice since correlation between observations naturally decrease with time for many problems. In our experiments, we actually find that local attention is a surprisingly strong baseline in both image generation and language modeling: for e.g., a scaled up ImageTransformer (Parmar et al., 2018) gets 3.48 bits/dim compared to the 3.44 bits/dim reported in Child et al. (2019). Similarly, scaled up versions of Transformer with local attention and the relative positional encoding scheme of Shaw et al. (2018) are able to get 19.8 perplexity on Wikitext-103, 1.10 bits per byte on enwik- 8 and 39.3 on PG-19, while Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) gets $18.3,0.99$ and 36.3 respectively. From an efficiency perspective, local attention is also interesting since sparsity patterns are regular, contiguous in memory and known in advance. In this work, however, we are interested in a more generic formulation of attention sparsity and would like the sparsity pattern to be informed by the data, i.e., $\\mathcal{S}=f(\\mathbf{x})$. This approach has several modeling advantages: it can accommodate data without a clear ordering over observations. For temporal data, it can also discover patterns with greater sparsity if some types of queries have a longer lasting effect on future observations than others. Content-based sparse attention should however be carefully implemented if we need to avoid instantiating full attention matrices at any point in time. For instance, Correia et al. (2019) infer sparsity from data but their formulation instantiates a full attention matrix before finding its sparse counterpart. The next section explains how a natively sparse approach can actually be devised inspired by the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. ### 4.1 Routing Attention with Clustering\n\nOur strategy follows the motivation we delineated in the previous section: we model sparse attention matrices with a low rank sparsity patterns relying on $k$-means clustering. Our strategy first assigns queries and keys to clusters. Then only queries and keys from the same cluster are considered for attention. Precisely, our model clusters both keys $K$ and queries $Q$ using mini-batch $k$-means clustering on the same set of centroid vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\left(\\mu_{1}, \\cdots, \\mu_{k}\\right) \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{k \\times d}$. These centroid parameters are model parameters and are shared across sequences. They are\nlearned online along with the rest of the parameters, as delineated in (Bottou and Bengio, 1995). Once cluster membership for queries and keys are determined, we denote by $\\mu\\left(Q_{i}\\right) \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ the nearest centroid to $Q_{i}$ and by $\\mu\\left(K_{j}\\right) \\in \\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ the nearest centroid to $K_{j}$. This allows us to define our sparse attention strategy as\n\n$$\nX_{i}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{\\substack{j: K_{j} \\in \\mu\\left(Q_{i}\\right), j<i}} A_{i j} V_{j}\n$$\n\nIn summary, queries are routed to keys belonging to the same cluster. To see the connection with Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS), we recall the setting of the MIPS problem adapted to the case of dot-product attention. In this problem we are given a large collection of vectors $\\mathcal{K}=\\left\\{K_{1}, \\cdots, K_{n}\\right\\}$ of size $n$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and for a given query $Q_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we are interested in searching for a key $K_{j} \\in \\mathcal{K}$ which (approximately) maximizes $Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j}$ :\n\n$$\nK_{j}=\\arg \\max _{x \\in \\mathcal{K}} Q_{i}^{\\top} x\n$$\n\nThe MIPS problem is useful in the dot product attention setting because the importance of a particular key $K_{j}$ to a query $Q_{i}$ is directly proportional to its dot product $Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j}$. Thus given a budget of items that a query $Q_{i}$ can attend to, the optimal choice of keys $K_{j}$ are the ones given by the MIPS objective in Equation 9. The motivation for using $k$-means clustering, is the observation that the MIPS problem is equivalent to the Nearest Neighbor Search (NNS) problem when the norm of every element $K_{j} \\in \\mathcal{K}$ is constant. Therefore, we work with queries and keys which are unit vectors, projecting them onto the unit ball, immediately before computing them. In practice, instead of normalizing by the $\\ell_{2}$ norm, we use Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) with the scale and bias terms disabled. This has the benefit of projecting vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ to the $d$-ball and prevents its entries from becoming too small. These layer normalized keys and queries are also used subsequently for computing the dot product attention. Note that performing $k$-means algorithm on unit vectors is equivalent to the spherical $k$-means algorithm. Projecting queries and keys to the unit ball implies that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left\\|Q_{i}-K_{j}\\right\\|^{2} \\\\\n& =\\left\\|Q_{i}\\right\\|^{2}+\\left\\|K_{j}\\right\\|^{2}-2 Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j} \\\\\n& =2-2\\left(Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus if $Q_{i}$ and $K_{j}$ belong to the same cluster center i.e., $\\mu\\left(Q_{i}\\right)=\\mu\\left(K_{j}\\right)=\\mu$, then it follows that there is some $\\varepsilon>0$, such that $\\left\\|Q_{i}-\\mu\\right\\|,\\left\\|K_{j}-\\mu\\right\\|<\\varepsilon$. This implies via triangle inequality that:\n\n$$\n\\left\\|Q_{i}-K_{j}\\right\\| \\leq\\left\\|Q_{i}-\\mu\\right\\|+\\left\\|K_{j}-\\mu\\right\\|<2 \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nThus from Equation 12 it follows that, $Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j}>$ $1-2 \\varepsilon^{2}$. Therefore, when two time steps $i>j$ are assigned the same cluster due to a small $\\left\\|Q_{i}-\\mu\\right\\|,\\left\\|K_{j}-\\mu\\right\\|$ distance, it also means that their attention weight $Q_{i}^{\\top} K_{j}$ is high, i.e., $K_{j}$ is an approximate solution to the MIPS objective of Equation 9 for query $Q_{i}$. This analysis shows that our clustering routing strategy preserves large attention weights as non-zero entries. Since, we route attention via spherical $k$-means clustering, we dub our model Routing Transformer. We give a detailed pseudo-code implementation for the routing attention computation in Algorithm 1. A visualization of the attention scheme and its comparison to local and strided attention is given in Figure 1. The computational complexity of this variant of sparse attention is $O\\left(n k d+n^{2} d / k\\right)$. Cluster assignments correspond to the first term, i.e. it compares $n$ routing vectors to all $k$ centroids in a space of size $d$. Query/key dot products corresponds to the second term, i.e. assuming balanced clusters, each of the $n$ queries is compared to $n / k$ in its cluster through a dot product of dimension $d$. Therefore the optimal choice of $k$ is $\\sqrt{n}$ as in (Child et al., 2019), thereby reducing overall memory and computational cost to $O\\left(n^{1.5} d\\right)$ instead of $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ (Vaswani et al., 2017). In practice, we apply mini-batch $k$-means to train the cluster centroids. However, in order to infer balanced routing patterns, we define the sets $S_{i}$ to be of equal size roughly $n / k \\sim \\sqrt{n}$, i.e. for every centroid $\\mu_{i}$ we sort tokens by distance to $\\mu_{i}$ and cluster membership is determined by this threshold (top-k). This adds an additional $O(n \\log n)$ term to the cost, however note that this is eclipsed by the dominating term of $O\\left(n^{1.5} d\\right)$. This strategy is simple and efficient. In particular, it guarantees that all clusters have the same size, which is extremely important in terms of computational efficiency on parallel hardware like graphic cards. As a downside, this assignment does not guarantee that each point belongs to a single cluster. In the future, we want to investigate using balanced variants of $k$-means (Banerjee and Ghosh, 2004; Malinen and Fr\u00e4nti, 2014) which is not common in an online setting. During training, we update each cluster centroid $\\mu$ by an exponentially moving average of all the keys and queries assigned to it:\n$\\mu \\leftarrow \\lambda \\mu+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{2} \\sum_{i: \\mu\\left(Q_{i}\\right)=\\mu} Q_{i}+\\frac{(1-\\lambda)}{2} \\sum_{j: \\mu\\left(K_{j}\\right)=\\mu} K_{j}$,\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a decay parameter which we usually set to 0.999 . Additionally, we also exclude padding tokens from affecting the centroids. There is an additional nuance regarding clustering queries and keys that comes into play when using causal attention (i.e. left to right masking), as is usually the case in language models.

ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering attention routing*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Efficient Clustering Based On A Unified View Of $K$-means And Ratio-cut\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering attention routing*\n\n*Shenfei Pei, F. Nie, Rong Wang, Xuelong Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework of k -means and ratio-cut is revisited, and a novel and ef\ufb01cient clustering algorithm is then proposed based on this framework that is easily scalable and applicable to large practical problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral clustering and k -means, both as two major traditional clustering methods, are still attracting a lot of attention, although a variety of novel clustering algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Firstly, a uni\ufb01ed framework of k -means and ratio-cut is revisited, and a novel and ef\ufb01cient clustering algorithm is then proposed based on this framework. The time and space complexity of our method are both linear with respect to the number of samples, and are independent of the number of clusters to construct, more importantly. These properties mean that it is easily scalable and applicable to large practical problems. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world benchmark and 8 facial datasets validate the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. In particular, over 15x and 7x speed-up can be obtained with respect to k -means on the synthetic dataset of 1 million samples and the benchmark dataset (CelebA) of 200k samples, respectively [GitHub].\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Parallel and Efficient Hierarchical k-Median Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering attention routing*\n\n*Vincent Cohen-Addad, Silvio Lattanzi, A. Norouzi-Fard, C. Sohler, O. Svensson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a fundamental unsupervised learning task, hierarchical clustering has been extensively studied in the past decade. In particular, standard metric formulations as hierarchical k -center, k -means, and k -median received a lot of attention and the problems have been studied extensively in different models of computation. Despite all this interest, not many ef\ufb01cient parallel algorithms are known for these problems. In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that, when using machines with memory s (for s \u2208 \u2126(log 2 ( n + \u2206 + d )) ), outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every \ufb01xed value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution. Furthermore, we also get that in for all k simultanuously the cost of the solution is at most an expected O (min { d, log n } log \u2206 log(\u2206 dn )) factor bigger that the corresponding optimal solution. The algorithm requires in O (log s ( nd log( n + \u2206))) rounds. Here d is the dimension of the data set and \u2206 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance of two points in the input dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst parallel algorithm for the hierarchical k -median problem with theoretical guarantees. We further complement our theoretical results with an empirical study of our algorithm that shows its effectiveness in practice.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering attention routing*\n\n*W. Kool, H. V. Hoof, Max Welling*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network is proposed and it is shown how to train this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic greedy rollout, which is more efficient than using a value function.\n\n**Abstract:** The recently presented idea to learn heuristics for combinatorial optimization problems is promising as it can save costly development. However, to push this idea towards practical implementation, we need better models and better ways of training. We contribute in both directions: we propose a model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network and we show how to train this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic greedy rollout, which we find is more efficient than using a value function. We significantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes. With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 1000  (*Influential: 264*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, focusing on efficient clustering, hardware optimization, memory management, and dynamic routing in attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Efficient Clustering Algorithms for Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Node-to-Cluster Attention (N2C-Attn) Mechanism**:\n   This mechanism, described in the Cluster-wise Graph Transformer paper, incorporates techniques from Multiple Kernel Learning into a kernelized attention framework. It captures information at both node and cluster levels, which can be adapted to hierarchical attention mechanisms in language models. This approach ensures that the model can focus on both local and global features efficiently.\n\n2. **Clustering Ensemble Algorithm**:\n   The clustering ensemble algorithm using cluster confidence (CEDECC) can be relevant in the context of clustering attention mechanisms. This method evaluates the quality of low-dimensional embeddings and combines deep clustering with clustering ensemble strategies, which could be applied to improve the efficiency and robustness of attention mechanisms in language models.\n\n### Hardware-Optimized Routing Strategies in Neural Networks\n\n1. **IO-Aware Algorithms**:\n   Studies like FlashAttention highlight the importance of IO-aware algorithms in reducing memory reads/writes, which is crucial for hardware optimization. Implementing similar tiling strategies in attention mechanisms can significantly improve performance by reducing memory access[References: Dao et al., 2022].\n\n2. **Structured Matrices**:\n   The use of structured matrices, as seen in H-Transformer-1D, can enable efficient computation and reduce memory complexity. This approach can be applied to optimize the routing strategies in neural networks, making them more hardware-efficient[References: Zhu & Soricut, 2021].\n\n### Memory-Efficient Implementations of Hierarchical Structures\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**:\n   The H-Transformer-1D and Neighborhood Attention Transformer demonstrate how hierarchical attention can achieve linear time and space complexity. These mechanisms can be integrated into autoregressive language models to improve memory efficiency and reduce computational complexity[References: Zhu & Soricut, 2021; Shi et al., 2022].\n\n2. **Memory-Efficient Attention Manipulation**:\n   AtMan provides insights into memory-efficient attention manipulation, which can be applied to hierarchical structures in language models. This approach focuses on optimizing memory access patterns and reducing the memory footprint of attention mechanisms[References: Deb et al., 2023].\n\n### Dynamic Routing in Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Dynamic Attention Adjustment**:\n   The use of dynamic attention mechanisms, such as Deformable Attention in the Hybrid EfficientNet models, can be adapted to language models. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the receptive field based on the complexity of the input features, which can enhance the model's ability to focus on key information.\n\n2. **Node-to-Cluster Attention**:\n   The N2C-Attn mechanism also involves dynamic routing by adjusting the attention between node and cluster levels. This can be a valuable strategy for implementing dynamic routing in attention mechanisms within autoregressive language models.\n\n### Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Efficient Clustering**: Utilize clustering ensemble algorithms and node-to-cluster attention mechanisms to improve the efficiency and robustness of attention.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Implement IO-aware algorithms and use structured matrices to optimize memory access and computation.\n- **Memory Management**: Employ hierarchical attention mechanisms and memory-efficient attention manipulation to reduce memory complexity.\n- **Dynamic Routing**: Integrate dynamic attention mechanisms, such as deformable attention and node-to-cluster attention, to enhance the model's focus on key features.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",
