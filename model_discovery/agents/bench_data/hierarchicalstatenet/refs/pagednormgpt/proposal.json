Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F. Chen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, Patrick Gallinari*\n\n**Published in:** Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs that effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models are a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 4.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models attention mechanisms neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 190  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 4. Lipschitz Normalization for Self-Attention Layers with Application to Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*George Dasoulas, Kevin Scaman, Aladin Virmaux*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that a deep GAT model with LipschitzNorm achieves state of the art results for node label prediction tasks that exhibit long-range dependencies, while showing consistent improvements over their unnormalized counterparts in benchmark node classification tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention based neural networks are state of the art in a large range of applications. However, their performance tends to degrade when the number of layers increases. In this work, we show that enforcing Lipschitz continuity by normalizing the attention scores can significantly improve the performance of deep attention models. First, we show that, for deep graph attention networks (GAT), gradient explosion appears during training, leading to poor performance of gradient-based training algorithms. To address this issue, we derive a theoretical analysis of the Lipschitz continuity of attention modules and introduce LipschitzNorm, a simple and parameter-free normalization for self-attention mechanisms that enforces the model to be Lipschitz continuous. We then apply LipschitzNorm to GAT and Graph Transformers and show that their performance is substantially improved in the deep setting (10 to 30 layers). More specifically, we show that a deep GAT model with LipschitzNorm achieves state of the art results for node label prediction tasks that exhibit long-range dependencies, while showing consistent improvements over their unnormalized counterparts in benchmark node classification tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5.

T'oth*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and it is shown that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Abstract:** Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards Relation-centered Pooling and Convolution for Heterogeneous Graph Learning Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Jiong Jin, Xiaowei Huang, Xin Chen, Youhua Xia, Yao Yao, Yuze Liu, Tiehua Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous graph neural network has unleashed great potential on graph representation learning and shown superior performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and clustering. Existing heterogeneous graph learning networks are primarily designed to either rely on pre-defined meta-paths or use attention mechanisms for type-specific attentive message propagation on different nodes/edges, incurring many customization efforts and computational costs. To this end, we design a relation-centered Pooling and Convolution for Heterogeneous Graph learning Network, namely PC-HGN, to enable relation-specific sampling and cross-relation convolutions, from which the structural heterogeneity of the graph can be better encoded into the embedding space through the adaptive training process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing with state-of-the-art graph learning models on three different real-world datasets, and the results show that PC-HGN consistently outperforms all the baseline and improves the performance maximumly up by 17.8%.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cyclic Differentiable Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Haibin Ling, Liang Wang, Hao Du, Jianlong Fu, Yan Huang, Houwen Peng, Hongyuan Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable ARchiTecture Search, i.e., DARTS, has drawn great attention in neural architecture search. It tries to find the optimal architecture in a shallow search network and then measures its performance in a deep evaluation network. The independent optimization of the search and evaluation networks, however, leaves room for potential improvement by allowing interaction between the two networks. To address the problematic optimization issue, we propose new joint optimization objectives and a novel Cyclic Differentiable ARchiTecture Search framework, dubbed CDARTS. Considering the structure difference, CDARTS builds a cyclic feedback mechanism between the search and evaluation networks with introspective distillation. First, the search network generates an initial architecture for evaluation, and the weights of the evaluation network are optimized. Second, the architecture weights in the search network are further optimized by the label supervision in classification, as well as the regularization from the evaluation network through feature distillation. Repeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and evaluation networks and thus enables the evolution of the architecture to fit the final evaluation network. The experiments and analysis on CIFAR, ImageNet and NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art ones. Specifically, in the DARTS search space, we achieve 97.52% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10 and 76.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. In the chain-structured search space, we achieve 78.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, which is 1.1% higher than EfficientNet-B0.

This architecture addresses the limitations of Mamba-2, which relies on the Markov assumption and can lead to information loss for tokens that need interactions with distant tokens. By incorporating SALs, Taipan enhances the ability to capture complex dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### State Space Models with Attention-like Mechanisms\nState space models, such as Mamba-2, have been shown to generalize linear attention using structured state-space models. These models can be interpreted as having attention-like mechanisms, where the recurrence can be expressed as a matrix multiplication that encodes temporal dependencies and content-based interactions similar to attention. This formulation allows for efficient sequence processing with near-linear complexity, making it a promising alternative to traditional transformers.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\nSSMs like Mamba-2 offer constant memory usage during inference and have demonstrated performance comparable to transformers in certain language tasks. The hybrid approach of combining SSMs with attention mechanisms, as seen in Taipan, aims to balance computational efficiency and recall accuracy, particularly in memory-intensive tasks. This balance is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently and scaling the model to larger sizes.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### State Space Models for Sequence Processing\nState space models have emerged as a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. With a computational complexity of O(L log L), these architectures can handle significantly longer sequences than traditional transformers, making them highly scalable.\n\n### Adaptive and Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nThe use of Gaussian kernel functions to replace the dot-product similarity in self-attention, as mentioned in the SOFT paper, provides an efficient alternative to traditional attention mechanisms. This approach can be integrated into hybrid SSM-attention architectures to further enhance efficiency and scalability[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the Taipan architecture and the concept of combining state space models with attention mechanisms offer significant potential for improving the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models. These approaches leverage the strengths of both SSMs and attention mechanisms to handle long-range dependencies and complex sequences efficiently.\n",

Transformers rely on a trainable attention mechanism that identifies complex dependencies between the elements of each input sequence. Unfortunately, the regular Transformer scales quadratically with the number of tokens $L$ in the input sequence, which is prohibitively expensive for large $L$ and precludes its usage in settings with limited computational resources even for moderate values of $L$. Several solutions have been proposed to address this issue (Beltagy et al., 2020, Gulati et al., 2020, Chan et al. 2020, Child et al. 2019, Bello et al., 2019). Most approaches restrict the attention mechanism to attend to local neighborhoods (Parmar et al. 2018) or incorporate structural priors on attention such as sparsity (Child et al., 2019), pooling-based compression (Rae et al, 2020) clustering/binning/convolution techniques (e.g. (Roy et al., 2020) which applies $k$-means clustering to learn dynamic sparse attention regions, or (Kitaev et al. 2020), where locality sensitive hashing is used to group together tokens of similar embeddings), sliding windows (Beltagy et al., 2020), or truncated targeting (Chelba et al. 2020). There is also a long line of research on using dense attention matrices, but defined by low-rank kernels substituting softmax (Katharopoulos et al. 2020. Shen et al., 2018). Those methods critically rely on kernels admitting explicit representations as dot-products of finite positive-feature vectors. The approaches above do not aim to approximate regular attention, but rather propose simpler and more tractable attention mechanisms, often by incorporating additional constraints (e.g. identical query and key sets as in (Kitaev et al. 2020) , or by trading regular with sparse attention using more\n\n[^0]layers (Child et al., 2019). Unfortunately, there is a lack of rigorous guarantees for the representation power produced by such methods, and sometimes the validity of sparsity patterns can only be verified empirically through trial and error by constructing special GPU operations (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Nystr\u00f6mformer: A nystr\u00f6m-based algorithm for approximating self-attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, G. Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

As one of its core components, the softmax attention helps to capture long-range dependencies yet prohibits its scale-up due to the quadratic space and time complexity to the sequence length. Kernel methods are often adopted to reduce the complexity by approximating the softmax operator. Nevertheless, due to the approximation errors, their performances vary in different tasks/corpus and suffer crucial performance drops when compared with the vanilla softmax attention. In this paper, we propose a linear transformer called cosFormer that can achieve comparable or better accuracy to the vanilla transformer in both casual and cross attentions. cosFormer is based on two key properties of softmax attention: i). non-negativeness of the attention matrix; ii). a non-linear re-weighting scheme that can concentrate the distribution of the attention matrix. As its linear substitute, cosFormer fulfills these properties with a linear operator and a cosine-based distance re-weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on language modeling and text understanding tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. We further examine our method on long sequences and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Long-Range Arena benchmark.

GraphQNTK: Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel for Graph Data\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*Yehui Tang, Junchi Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A quantum algorithm is proposed to approximately estimate the neural tangent kernel of the underlying graph neural network where a multi-head quantum attention mechanism is introduced to properly incorporate semantic similarity information of nodes into the model.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Kernels (GKs) are two fundamental tools used to analyze graph-structured data. Efforts have been recently made in developing a composite graph learning architecture combining the expressive power of GNNs and the transparent trainability of GKs. However, learning efficiency on these models should be carefully considered as the huge computation overhead. Besides, their convolutional methods are often straightforward and introduce severe loss of graph structure information. In this paper, we design a novel quantum graph learning model to characterize the structural information while using quantum parallelism to improve computing efficiency. Specifically, a quantum algorithm is proposed to approximately estimate the neural tangent kernel of the underlying graph neural network where a multi-head quantum attention mechanism is introduced to properly incorporate semantic similarity information of nodes into the model. We empirically show that our method achieves competitive performance on several graph classification benchmarks, and theoretical analysis is provided to demonstrate the superiority of our quantum algorithm.

Excess Risk of Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks in Teacher-Student Settings and its Superiority to Kernel Methods\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*Shunta Akiyama, Taiji Suzuki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs, and shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator, including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate.\n\n**Abstract:** While deep learning has outperformed other methods for various tasks, theoretical frameworks that explain its reason have not been fully established. To address this issue, we investigate the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. Especially, we consider the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is trained in two phases: first by noisy gradient descent and then by the vanilla gradient descent. Our result shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator (more generally, linear estimators), including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate. The key concept inducing this superiority is the non-convexity of the neural network models. Even though the loss landscape is highly non-convex, the student network adaptively learns the teacher neurons.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Classifying high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures: Where kernel methods fail and neural networks succeed\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*Maria Refinetti, Sebastian Goldt, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborov'a*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is theoretically shown that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task and illustrates how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Abstract:** A recent series of theoretical works showed that the dynamics of neural networks with a certain initialisation are well-captured by kernel methods. Concurrent empirical work demonstrated that kernel methods can come close to the performance of neural networks on some image classification tasks. These results raise the question of whether neural networks only learn successfully if kernels also learn successfully, despite neural networks being more expressive. Here, we show theoretically that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task. We study the high-dimensional limit where the number of samples is linearly proportional to the input dimension, and show that while small 2LNN achieve near-optimal performance on this task, lazy training approaches such as random features and kernel methods do not. Our analysis is based on the derivation of a closed set of equations that track the learning dynamics of the 2LNN and thus allow to extract the asymptotic performance of the network as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and other hyperparameters. We finally illustrate how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A.

However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

However, existing works apply the methods for symmetric kernels to the asymmetric self-attention, resulting in a nontrivial gap between the analytical understanding and numerical implementation. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to represent and optimize self-attention through asymmetric Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (KSVD), which is also motivated by the low-rank property of self-attention normally observed in deep layers. Through asymmetric KSVD, $i$) a primal-dual representation of self-attention is formulated, where the optimization objective is cast to maximize the projection variances in the attention outputs; $ii$) a novel attention mechanism, i.e., Primal-Attention, is proposed via the primal representation of KSVD, avoiding explicit computation of the kernel matrix in the dual; $iii$) with KKT conditions, we prove that the stationary solution to the KSVD optimization in Primal-Attention yields a zero-value objective. In this manner, KSVD optimization can be implemented by simply minimizing a regularization loss, so that low-rank property is promoted without extra decomposition. Numerical experiments show state-of-the-art performance of our Primal-Attention with improved efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the deployed KSVD optimization regularizes Primal-Attention with a sharper singular value decay than that of the canonical self-attention, further verifying the great potential of our method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides a primal-dual representation for the asymmetric kernel in self-attention and successfully applies it to modeling and optimization.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

ECA-Net: Efficient Channel Attention for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n*QinGhua Hu, WangMeng Zuo, Peihua Li, Qilong Wang, Pengfei Zhu, Banggu Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, channel attention mechanism has demonstrated to offer great potential in improving the performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods dedicate to developing more sophisticated attention modules for achieving better performance, which inevitably increase model complexity. To overcome the paradox of performance and complexity trade-off, this paper proposes an Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) module, which only involves a handful of parameters while bringing clear performance gain. By dissecting the channel attention module in SENet, we empirically show avoiding dimensionality reduction is important for learning channel attention, and appropriate cross-channel interaction can preserve performance while significantly decreasing model complexity. Therefore, we propose a local cross-channel interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction, which can be efficiently implemented via $1D$ convolution. Furthermore, we develop a method to adaptively select kernel size of $1D$ convolution, determining coverage of local cross-channel interaction. The proposed ECA module is efficient yet effective, e.g., the parameters and computations of our modules against backbone of ResNet50 are 80 vs. 24.37M and 4.7e-4 GFLOPs vs. 3.86 GFLOPs, respectively, and the performance boost is more than 2% in terms of Top-1 accuracy. We extensively evaluate our ECA module on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation with backbones of ResNets and MobileNetV2. The experimental results show our module is more efficient while performing favorably against its counterparts.\n\n**Conference:** eca-net-efficient-channel-attention-for-deep-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Non-Local Neural Networks With Grouped Bilinear Attentional Transforms\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods attention computation neural networks*\n\n* Changhu Wang,  Yadong Mu,  Zehuan Yuan, Lu Chi*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling spatial or temporal long-range dependency plays a key role in deep neural networks. Conventional dominant solutions include recurrent operations on sequential data or deeply stacking convolutional layers with small kernel size. Recently, a number of non-local operators (such as self-attention based) have been devised. They are typically generic and can be plugged into many existing network pipelines for globally computing among any two neurons in a feature map. This work proposes a novel non-local operator. It is inspired by the attention mechanism of human visual system, which can quickly attend to important local parts in sight and suppress other less-relevant information. The core of our method is learnable and data-adaptive bilinear attentional transform (BA-Transform), whose merits are three-folds: first, BA-Transform is versatile to model a wide spectrum of local or global attentional operations, such as emphasizing specific local regions. Each BA-Transform is learned in a data-adaptive way; Secondly, to address the discrepancy among features, we further design grouped BA-Transforms, which essentially apply different attentional operations to different groups of feature channels; Thirdly, many existing non-local operators are computation-intensive. The proposed BA-Transform is implemented by simple matrix multiplication and admits better efficacy. For empirical evaluation, we perform comprehensive experiments on two large-scale benchmarks, ImageNet and Kinetics, for image / video classification respectively. The achieved accuracies and various ablation experiments consistently demonstrate significant improvement by large margins.\r\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2020-6\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient kernel-based attention mechanisms, computational efficiency, and scalability, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Efficient Kernel-Based Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Performer and Related Models**:\n   The Performer model approximates softmax attention using kernel-based methods, achieving linear complexity with respect to sequence length.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Recent work doing incremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of entities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory, which can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities in memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that tracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a linear runtime in length of document.

Cheap and Quick: Efficient Vision-Language Instruction Tuning for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management language models neural networks*\n\n*Gen Luo, Yiyi Zhou, Tianhe Ren, Shen Chen, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel and affordable solution for the effective VL adaption of LLMs, called Mixture-of-Modality Adaptation (MMA), which adopts lightweight modules, i.e., adapters, to bridge the gap between LLMs and VL tasks, which also enables the joint optimization of the image and language models\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, growing interest has been aroused in extending the multimodal capability of large language models (LLMs), e.g., vision-language (VL) learning, which is regarded as the next milestone of artificial general intelligence. However, existing solutions are prohibitively expensive, which not only need to optimize excessive parameters, but also require another large-scale pre-training before VL instruction tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel and affordable solution for the effective VL adaption of LLMs, called Mixture-of-Modality Adaptation (MMA). Instead of using large neural networks to connect the image encoder and LLM, MMA adopts lightweight modules, i.e., adapters, to bridge the gap between LLMs and VL tasks, which also enables the joint optimization of the image and language models. Meanwhile, MMA is also equipped with a routing algorithm to help LLMs achieve an automatic shift between single- and multi-modal instructions without compromising their ability of natural language understanding. To validate MMA, we apply it to a recent LLM called LLaMA and term this formed large vision-language instructed model as LaVIN. To validate MMA and LaVIN, we conduct extensive experiments under two setups, namely multimodal science question answering and multimodal dialogue. The experimental results not only demonstrate the competitive performance and the superior training efficiency of LaVIN than existing multimodal LLMs, but also confirm its great potential as a general-purpose chatbot. More importantly, the actual expenditure of LaVIN is extremely cheap, e.g., only 1.4 training hours with 3.8M trainable parameters, greatly confirming the effectiveness of MMA.

EvoPrompting: Language Models for Code-Level Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management language models neural networks*\n\n*Angelica Chen, David Dohan, David R. So*\n\n**TL;DR:** EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the recent impressive accomplishments of language models (LMs) for code generation, we explore the use of LMs as adaptive mutation and crossover operators for an evolutionary neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm. While NAS still proves too difficult a task for LMs to succeed at solely through prompting, we find that the combination of evolutionary prompt engineering with soft prompt-tuning, a method we term EvoPrompting, consistently finds diverse and high performing models. We first demonstrate that EvoPrompting is effective on the computationally efficient MNIST-1D dataset, where EvoPrompting produces convolutional architecture variants that outperform both those designed by human experts and naive few-shot prompting in terms of accuracy and model size. We then apply our method to searching for graph neural networks on the CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, where EvoPrompting is able to design novel architectures that outperform current state-of-the-art models on 21 out of 30 algorithmic reasoning tasks while maintaining similar model size. EvoPrompting is successful at designing accurate and efficient neural network architectures across a variety of machine learning tasks, while also being general enough for easy adaptation to other tasks beyond neural network design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4.

Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. GMLake: Efficient and Transparent GPU Memory Defragmentation for Large-scale DNN Training with Virtual Memory Stitching\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management language models neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs), such as large language models (LLMs), have revolutionized the artificial intelligence (AI) field and become increasingly popular. However, training or fine-tuning such models requires substantial computational power and resources, where the memory capacity of a single acceleration device like a GPU is one of the most important bottlenecks. Owing to the prohibitively large overhead (e.g., $10 \\times$) of GPUs' native memory allocator, DNN frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow adopt a caching allocator that maintains a memory pool with a splitting mechanism for fast memory (de)allocation. Unfortunately, the caching allocator's efficiency degrades quickly for popular memory reduction techniques such as recomputation, offloading, distributed training, and low-rank adaptation. The primary reason is that those memory reduction techniques introduce frequent and irregular memory (de)allocation requests, leading to severe fragmentation problems for the splitting-based caching allocator. To mitigate this fragmentation problem, we propose a novel memory allocation framework based on low-level GPU virtual memory management called GPU memory lake (GMLake). GMLake employs a novel virtual memory stitching (VMS) mechanism, which can fuse or combine non-contiguous memory blocks with a virtual memory address mapping. GMLake can reduce an average of 9.2 GB (up to 25 GB) GPU memory usage and 15% (up to 33% ) fragmentation among eight LLM models on GPU A100 with 80 GB memory. GMLake is completely transparent to the DNN models and memory reduction techniques and ensures the seamless execution of resource-intensive deep-learning tasks.

TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. An Evolved Universal Transformer Memory\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management language models neural networks*\n\n*Yujin Tang, Tianyu Zhao, Qi Sun, Edoardo Cetin*\n\n**Abstract:** Prior methods propose to offset the escalating costs of modern foundation models by dropping specific parts of their contexts with hand-designed rules, while attempting to preserve their original performance. We overcome this trade-off with Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs), introducing a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. We evolve NAMMs atop pre-trained transformers to provide different latent contexts focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. NAMMs are universally applicable to any model using self-attention as they condition exclusively on the values in the produced attention matrices. Learning NAMMs on a small set of problems, we achieve substantial performance improvements across multiple long-context benchmarks while cutting the model's input contexts up to a fraction of the original sizes. We show the generality of our conditioning enables zero-shot transfer of NAMMs trained only on language to entirely new transformer architectures even across input modalities, with their benefits carrying over to vision and reinforcement learning.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on efficient memory management, attention mechanisms, and state management, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory Management Strategies\n\n### Memory Optimization Techniques\n- The paper on \"Understanding and Alleviating Memory Consumption in RLHF for LLMs\" discusses various memory management strategies such as Zero Redundancy Optimizers (ZeRO), gradient checkpointing, and CPU offloading. These techniques can be combined to optimize memory consumption, although it is crucial to understand their potential counter-intuitive effects on memory usage.\n\n### Dynamic Compression and Caching\n- The \"BitStack\" approach introduces a novel weight compression method that allows for fine-grained control over memory usage and model performance. This method decomposes weight matrices and adjusts the model size dynamically based on memory availability, which can be particularly useful for optimizing memory in resource-constrained settings.\n\n### Key-Value Caching\n- The YouTube video and associated discussion highlight the importance of key-value caching in decoder-only transformers. Techniques such as storing and reusing key and value arrays can significantly reduce computational overhead. Additionally, dynamic compression methods like quantization, pruning, and dimensionality reduction can further optimize the memory usage of key-value caches.\n\n## Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Kernel-Based Attention\n- Kernel-based attention mechanisms, such as those described in the \"Performers\" paper, offer efficient approximations of attention matrices using methods like FAVOR+ and the Nystr\u00f6m method. These approaches can provide theoretically sound and efficient attention approximations.\n\n### Linear Attention Variants\n- \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"cosFormer\" propose alternative attention mechanisms that maintain key properties of softmax attention while improving efficiency. Lightning Attention-2 uses tiling techniques to handle intra-block and inter-block components efficiently, leveraging GPU hardware.\n\n## State Space Integration and Selective State Mechanisms\n\n### Hidden Attention Patterns and Hybrid Architectures\n- Integrating State Space Models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms can leverage hidden attention patterns and offer potential for hybrid architectures. This integration can improve memory efficiency through selective state mechanisms, as suggested in the analysis note[Analysis Note].\n\n### Selective State Mechanisms\n- The analysis note emphasizes the importance of selective state mechanisms for memory optimization. By selectively managing state spaces, models can reduce memory consumption without compromising performance significantly[Analysis Note].\n\n## Implementation Considerations and Future Directions\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimizations\n- Implementations should be hardware-aware, leveraging techniques like tiling to optimize for GPU hardware, as seen in \"Lightning Attention-2\"[Analysis Note].\n\n### Balance Between Local and Global Processing\n- There is a need to balance local and global processing to ensure efficient memory and computation usage. This balance is crucial for maintaining performance while optimizing memory[Analysis Note].\n\n### Theoretical Guarantees and Approximation Accuracy\n- Ensuring theoretical guarantees and balancing approximation accuracy with efficiency is vital. Different kernel choices and attention mechanisms should be evaluated based on their impact on model performance and memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient autoregressive language models with improved memory management, optimized attention mechanisms, and effective state space integration.\n",

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/44 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nH., Gonzalez, J.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Learning to Combine Top-Down and Bottom-Up Signals in Recurrent Neural Networks with Attention over Modules\n\n*From Search Query: paged memory management attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, Alex Lamb, Anirudh Goyal, Vikram S. Voleti, M. Shanahan, Guillaume Lajoie, M. Mozer, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** Deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention are explored, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data.\n\n**Abstract:** Robust perception relies on both bottom-up and top-down signals. Bottom-up signals consist of what's directly observed through sensation. Top-down signals consist of beliefs and expectations based on past experience and short-term memory, such as how the phrase `peanut butter and~...' will be completed. The optimal combination of bottom-up and top-down information remains an open question, but the manner of combination must be dynamic and both context and task dependent. To effectively utilize the wealth of potential top-down information available, and to prevent the cacophony of intermixed signals in a bidirectional architecture, mechanisms are needed to restrict information flow. We explore deep recurrent neural net architectures in which bottom-up and top-down signals are dynamically combined using attention. Modularity of the architecture further restricts the sharing and communication of information. Together, attention and modularity direct information flow, which leads to reliable performance improvements in perceptual and language tasks, and in particular improves robustness to distractions and noisy data. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, sequential image classification, video prediction and reinforcement learning that the \\emph{bidirectional} information flow can improve results over strong baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 57  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Not-So-CLEVR: Visual Relations Strain Feedforward Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: paged memory management attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Matthew Ricci, Junkyung Kim, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, it is argued that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a hallmark of biological vision. Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3.

Semi-parametric architectures are typically more compact than parametric models, but their computational complexity is often quadratic. In contrast, SPIN attains linear complexity via a cross-attention mechanism between datapoints inspired by inducing point methods. Querying large training sets can be particularly useful in meta-learning, as it unlocks additional training signal, but often exceeds the scaling limits of existing models. We use SPIN as the basis of the Inducing Point Neural Process, a probabilistic model which supports large contexts in meta-learning and achieves high accuracy where existing models fail. In our experiments, SPIN reduces memory requirements, improves accuracy across a range of meta-learning tasks, and improves state-of-the-art performance on an important practical problem, genotype imputation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Memory Networks for Visual and Textual Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: paged memory management attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Caiming Xiong, Stephen Merity, R.

One such architecture, the dynamic memory network (DMN), obtained high accuracy on a variety of language tasks. However, it was not shown whether the architecture achieves strong results for question answering when supporting facts are not marked during training or whether it could be applied to other modalities such as images. Based on an analysis of the DMN, we propose several improvements to its memory and input modules. Together with these changes we introduce a novel input module for images in order to be able to answer visual questions.

Recognizing Implicit Discourse Relations via Repeated Reading: Neural Networks with Multi-Level Attention\n\n*From Search Query: paged memory management attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Yang Liu, Sujian Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the neural networks with multi-level attention (NNMA), combining the attention mechanism and external memories to gradually fix the attention on some specific words helpful to judging the discourse relations.\n\n**Abstract:** Recognizing implicit discourse relations is a challenging but important task in the field of Natural Language Processing. For such a complex text processing task, different from previous studies, we argue that it is necessary to repeatedly read the arguments and dynamically exploit the efficient features useful for recognizing discourse relations. To mimic the repeated reading strategy, we propose the neural networks with multi-level attention (NNMA), combining the attention mechanism and external memories to gradually fix the attention on some specific words helpful to judging the discourse relations. Experiments on the PDTB dataset show that our proposed method achieves the state-of-art results. The visualization of the attention weights also illustrates the progress that our model observes the arguments on each level and progressively locates the important words.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 80  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on paged memory management techniques in attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and references that can be helpful:\n\n## Paged Memory Management in Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **PagedAttention**:\n   The concept of PagedAttention is crucial for efficient memory management in large language models. This approach involves managing attention states in a paged manner, which significantly reduces memory overhead without compromising model performance. A study by Kwon et al. discusses \"Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention,\" highlighting how this method can be implemented to optimize memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Optimizations\n\n1. **Selective State Mechanisms**:\n   Implementing selective state mechanisms can further enhance memory efficiency. This involves dynamically compressing or selecting only the most relevant states, which can be integrated with paged memory management. This approach is mentioned in the analysis note, emphasizing the importance of selective state compression based on importance[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Hardware-Aware Implementations**:\n   Hardware-aware tiling strategies and optimized attention mechanisms are vital for performance. For instance, the Efficiently Scaled Attention Interatomic Potential (EScAIP) model leverages highly optimized self-attention mechanisms, including customized GPU kernels, to achieve substantial gains in efficiency, such as a 10x speed up in inference time and 5x less memory usage.\n\n3. **Linear Attention Variants**:\n   Linear attention variants can offer efficiency improvements. The \"Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\" paper discusses an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism that leverages the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, reducing communication overhead in distributed settings. This can be particularly useful for optimizing the memory-compute trade-offs in large language models[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration with Other Techniques\n\n1. **Dense Connections and Hierarchical Processing**:\n   Combining dense connections with hierarchical processing can enhance information flow without sacrificing efficiency. The DenseMamba model, which uses state space models with dense hidden connections, is an example of how this can be achieved. This approach maintains training parallelizability and inference efficiency while retaining fine-grained information crucial for the final output[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:\n   Integrating external memory components, such as those used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can enhance the model's ability to access and reference external knowledge, further optimizing memory usage and performance.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.43)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional fine-tuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 95  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 2.

Error Analysis Prompting Enables Human-Like Translation Evaluation in Large Language Models: A Case Study on ChatGPT\n\n*From Search Query: performance analysis normalization layers language models*\n\n*Qingyu Lu, Baopu Qiu, Liang Ding, Liping Xie, Dacheng Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Findings highlight the potential of EAPrompt as a human-like evaluator prompting technique for MT evaluation, and investigate several prompting designs, and propose a new prompting method called EAPrompt by combining Chain-of-Thoughts and Error Analysis.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency across several NLP tasks, such as machine translation, text summarization. Recent research (Kocmi and Federmann, 2023) has shown that utilizing LLMs for assessing the quality of machine translation (MT) achieves state-of-the-art performance at the system level but \\textit{performs poorly at the segment level}. To further improve the performance of LLMs on MT quality assessment, we investigate several prompting designs, and propose a new prompting method called \\textbf{\\texttt{Error Analysis Prompting}} (EAPrompt) by combining Chain-of-Thoughts (Wei et al., 2022) and Error Analysis (Lu et al., 2023). This technique emulates the commonly accepted human evaluation framework - Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM, Freitag et al. (2021)) and \\textit{produces explainable and reliable MT evaluations at both the system and segment level}. Experimental Results from the WMT22 metrics shared task validate the effectiveness of EAPrompt on various LLMs, with different structures. Further analysis confirms that EAPrompt effectively distinguishes major errors from minor ones, while also sharing a similar distribution of the number of errors with MQM. These findings highlight the potential of EAPrompt as a human-like evaluator prompting technique for MT evaluation.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Frozen Transformers in Language Models Are Effective Visual Encoder Layers\n\n*From Search Query: performance analysis normalization layers language models*\n\n*Ziqi Pang, Ziyang Xie, Yunze Man, Yu-Xiong Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper reveals that large language models (LLMs), despite being trained solely on textual data, are surprisingly strong encoders for purely visual tasks in the absence of language and proposes the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper reveals that large language models (LLMs), despite being trained solely on textual data, are surprisingly strong encoders for purely visual tasks in the absence of language. Even more intriguingly, this can be achieved by a simple yet previously overlooked strategy -- employing a frozen transformer block from pre-trained LLMs as a constituent encoder layer to directly process visual tokens. Our work pushes the boundaries of leveraging LLMs for computer vision tasks, significantly departing from conventional practices that typically necessitate a multi-modal vision-language setup with associated language prompts, inputs, or outputs. We demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances performance across a diverse range of tasks, encompassing pure 2D and 3D visual recognition tasks (e.g., image and point cloud classification), temporal modeling tasks (e.g., action recognition), non-semantic tasks (e.g., motion forecasting), and multi-modal tasks (e.g., 2D/3D visual question answering and image-text retrieval). Such improvements are a general phenomenon, applicable to various types of LLMs (e.g., LLaMA and OPT) and different LLM transformer blocks. We additionally propose the information filtering hypothesis to explain the effectiveness of pre-trained LLMs in visual encoding -- the pre-trained LLM transformer blocks discern informative visual tokens and further amplify their effect. This hypothesis is empirically supported by the observation that the feature activation, after training with LLM transformer blocks, exhibits a stronger focus on relevant regions. We hope that our work inspires new perspectives on utilizing LLMs and deepening our understanding of their underlying mechanisms.

Incorporating Residual and Normalization Layers into Analysis of Masked Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: performance analysis normalization layers language models*\n\n*Kentaro Inui, Sho Yokoi, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Goro Kobayashi*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has become ubiquitous in the natural language processing field. To interpret the Transformer-based models, their attention patterns have been extensively analyzed. However, the Transformer architecture is not only composed of the multi-head attention; other components can also contribute to Transformers' progressive performance. In this study, we extended the scope of the analysis of Transformers from solely the attention patterns to the whole attention block, i.e., multi-head attention, residual connection, and layer normalization. Our analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed. These results provide new intuitive explanations of existing reports; for example, discarding the learned attention patterns tends not to adversely affect the performance. The codes of our experiments are publicly available.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. AMPCliff: quantitative definition and benchmarking of activity cliffs in antimicrobial peptides\n\n*From Search Query: performance analysis normalization layers language models*\n\n*Fengfeng Zhou, Lan Huang, Ruochi Zhang, Yusi Fan, Yinheng Li, Yutong Guo, Yuqian Wu, Kewei Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Activity cliff (AC) is a phenomenon that a pair of similar molecules differ by a small structural alternation but exhibit a large difference in their biochemical activities. The AC of small molecules has been extensively investigated but limited knowledge is accumulated about the AC phenomenon in peptides with canonical amino acids. This study introduces a quantitative definition and benchmarking framework AMPCliff for the AC phenomenon in antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) composed by canonical amino acids. A comprehensive analysis of the existing AMP dataset reveals a significant prevalence of AC within AMPs. AMPCliff quantifies the activities of AMPs by the metric minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and defines 0.9 as the minimum threshold for the normalized BLOSUM62 similarity score between a pair of aligned peptides with at least two-fold MIC changes. This study establishes a benchmark dataset of paired AMPs in Staphylococcus aureus from the publicly available AMP dataset GRAMPA, and conducts a rigorous procedure to evaluate various AMP AC prediction models, including nine machine learning, four deep learning algorithms, four masked language models, and four generative language models. Our analysis reveals that these models are capable of detecting AMP AC events and the pre-trained protein language ESM2 model demonstrates superior performance across the evaluations. The predictive performance of AMP activity cliffs remains to be further improved, considering that ESM2 with 33 layers only achieves the Spearman correlation coefficient=0.50 for the regression task of the MIC values on the benchmark dataset.

It is particularly effective in scenarios with varying input sizes or non-stationary data distributions.\n- **Pre-Normalization** in transformers, where normalization is applied before multi-head attention, has been shown to provide training stability. Variants like DeepNorm address issues with larger gradients in pre-norm, enhancing stability and performance.\n\n## Comparison of Different Normalization Techniques\n\n- **Cluster-Based Normalization (CBN)** is a novel approach that groups input features into clusters and normalizes each cluster independently. This method can better capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to improved performance in tasks such as language modeling. CBN has been shown to outperform traditional normalization techniques like Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, especially in complex data scenarios.\n- **Layer Normalization vs. Batch Normalization**: Layer normalization operates on individual samples, making it more suitable for recurrent neural networks and transformers, whereas batch normalization operates across a mini-batch, which can be less effective in scenarios with varying batch sizes.\n\n## Impact on Training Stability and Convergence\n\n- **Layer Normalization** helps in faster convergence and improves training stability by normalizing the inputs across the features for each individual training example. This reduces internal covariate shifts, which is critical for deep neural networks.\n- **Pre-Normalization** in transformers also contributes to training stability by normalizing inputs before the multi-head attention mechanism, which is essential for large language models.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Metrics\n\n- For memory-efficient implementation, techniques like **FlashAttention** can be considered, which involve IO-aware algorithm design and tiling to reduce high-bandwidth memory (HBM) accesses. This approach is crucial for optimizing memory usage in large language models[References: Dao et al., 2022].\n- **Paged memory management** and **cache-aligned access patterns** are important for optimizing memory efficiency. While paged approaches show promise, they require careful implementation to balance memory savings with computational overhead[Key Insights].\n\n## Hardware Utilization Measurements\n\n- **Hardware-aware optimization** is essential for efficient inference. Techniques like **ShiftAddNAS** involve hardware-inspired search for efficient networks, incorporating different operators and resulting in significant energy and latency savings. This approach highlights the importance of considering different hardware architectures during model design[References: You et al., 2022].\n- **Vectorized operations** can improve efficiency, and IO-aware algorithm design is critical for optimizing hardware utilization during both training and inference[Key Insights].\n\n## Empirical Results and Implementation Details\n\n- Empirical results from studies on **CBN** show that it can outperform standard normalization techniques in various tasks, including language modeling. The learnable clustering mechanism in CBN allows the network to automatically discover optimal feature groupings, which is beneficial for complex data.\n- **Implementation details** such as placing layer normalization outside the residual path, as in the T5 model, or using pre-norm in transformers, can significantly impact performance and training stability.\n\n## Future Search Directions\n\nTo further improve autoregressive language model design, future searches should focus on:\n- **Real-world performance metrics** of different normalization approaches to understand their practical implications.\n- **Specific implementations of paged memory management** to optimize memory usage.\n- **Integration with autoregressive models** to ensure that the normalization techniques are tailored for these specific architectures.\n\nBy considering these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and high-performing autoregressive language models.\n",

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.33)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Korthikanti, Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Ali Hatamizadeh, Sudhakar Singh, Deepak Narayanan, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Vartika Singh, Jared Casper, Jan Kautz, M. Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** While pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities or long-context reasoning, and it is found that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks evaluated.\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Dynamic Sparse Graph for Efficient Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*L. Liu, Lei Deng, Xing Hu, Maohua Zhu, Guoqi Li, Yufei Ding, Yuan Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose to execute deep neural networks (DNNs) with dynamic and sparse graph (DSG) structure for compressive memory and accelerative execution during both training and inference. The great success of DNNs motivates the pursuing of lightweight models for the deployment onto embedded devices. However, most of the previous studies optimize for inference while neglect training or even complicate it. Training is far more intractable, since (i) the neurons dominate the memory cost rather than the weights in inference; (ii) the dynamic activation makes previous sparse acceleration via one-off optimization on fixed weight invalid; (iii) batch normalization (BN) is critical for maintaining accuracy while its activation reorganization damages the sparsity. To address these issues, DSG activates only a small amount of neurons with high selectivity at each iteration via a dimension-reduction search (DRS) and obtains the BN compatibility via a double-mask selection (DMS). Experiments show significant memory saving (1.7-4.5x) and operation reduction (2.3-4.4x) with little accuracy loss on various benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Score Matching with Deep Equilibrium Layers\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*Yuhao Huang, Qingsong Wang, Akwum Onwunta, Bao Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives is provided and enables the development of deep and expressive models with improved performance and comparable computational and memory costs over shallow architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Score matching methods, which estimate probability densities without computing the normalization constant, are particularly useful in deep learning. However, the computational and memory costs of score matching methods can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data or complex models, particularly due to the derivatives or Hessians of the log density function appearing in the objective function. Some existing approaches modify the objective function to reduce the quadratic computational complexity for the Hessian computation. However, the memory bottle-neck of score matching methods remains for deep learning. This study improves the memory efficiency of score matching by leveraging deep equilibrium models. We provide a theoretical analysis of deep equilibrium models for scoring matching and applying implicit differentiation to higher-order derivatives.

StreamNet: Memory-Efficient Streaming Tiny Deep Learning Inference on the Microcontroller\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*Hong-Sheng Zheng, Yu-Yuan Liu, Chen-Fong Hsu, Tsung Tai Yeh*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamNet uses 1D and 2D streaming processing and provides an parameter selection algorithm that automatically improve the performance of patch-based inference with minimal requirements on the MCU\u2019s SRAM memory space.\n\n**Abstract:** With the emerging Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) inference applications, there is a growing interest when deploying TinyML models on the low-power Microcon-troller Unit (MCU). However, deploying TinyML models on MCUs reveals several challenges due to the MCU\u2019s resource constraints, such as small flash memory, tight SRAM memory budget, and slow CPU performance. Unlike typical layer-wise inference, patch-based inference reduces the peak usage of SRAM memory on MCUs by saving small patches rather than the entire tensor in the SRAM memory. However, the processing of patch-based inference tremendously increases the amount of MACs against the layer-wise method. Thus, this notoriously computational overhead makes patch-based inference undesirable on MCUs. This work designs StreamNet that employs the stream buffer to eliminate the redundant computation of patch-based inference. StreamNet uses 1D and 2D streaming processing and provides an parameter selection algorithm that automatically improve the performance of patch-based inference with minimal requirements on the MCU\u2019s SRAM memory space. In 10 TinyML models, StreamNet-2D achieves a geometric mean of 7.3X speedup and saves 81% of MACs over the state-of-the-art patch-based inference.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*Mark D. McDonnell*\n\n**Abstract:** For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should\nideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually\nincrease when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements\nin error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks\ndeployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We\nalso considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test\nresults of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error\nrates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our\nerror-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that\noverfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning\nbatch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full\nprecision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate\nschedule, we found that training for 1-bit-per-weight is just as fast as\nfull-precision networks, with better accuracy than standard schedules, and\nachieved about 98%-99% of peak performance in just 62 training epochs for\nCIFAR-10/100.

In-Place Activated BatchNorm for Memory-Optimized Training of DNNs\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*Samuel Rota Bul\u00f2, Peter Kontschieder, Lorenzo Porzi*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work we present In-Place Activated Batch Normalization (InPlace-ABN)\n- a novel approach to drastically reduce the training memory footprint of\nmodern deep neural networks in a computationally efficient way. Our solution\nsubstitutes the conventionally used succession of BatchNorm + Activation layers\nwith a single plugin layer, hence avoiding invasive framework surgery while\nproviding straightforward applicability for existing deep learning frameworks.\nWe obtain memory savings of up to 50% by dropping intermediate results and by\nrecovering required information during the backward pass through the inversion\nof stored forward results, with only minor increase (0.8-2%) in computation\ntime. Also, we demonstrate how frequently used checkpointing approaches can be\nmade computationally as efficient as InPlace-ABN. In our experiments on image\nclassification, we demonstrate on-par results on ImageNet-1k with\nstate-of-the-art approaches. On the memory-demanding task of semantic\nsegmentation, we report results for COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes and Mapillary\nVistas, obtaining new state-of-the-art results on the latter without additional\ntraining data but in a single-scale and -model scenario.

Monte Carlo Convolution for Learning on Non-Uniformly Sampled Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization deep learning*\n\n*\u00c0lvar Vinacua, Pere-Pau V\u00e1zquez, Tobias Ritschel, Pedro Hermosilla, Timo Ropinski*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning systems extensively use convolution operations to process input\ndata. Though convolution is clearly defined for structured data such as 2D\nimages or 3D volumes, this is not true for other data types such as sparse\npoint clouds. Previous techniques have developed approximations to convolutions\nfor restricted conditions. Unfortunately, their applicability is limited and\ncannot be used for general point clouds. We propose an efficient and effective\nmethod to learn convolutions for non-uniformly sampled point clouds, as they\nare obtained with modern acquisition techniques. Learning is enabled by four\nkey novelties: first, representing the convolution kernel itself as a\nmultilayer perceptron; second, phrasing convolution as a Monte Carlo\nintegration problem, third, using this notion to combine information from\nmultiple samplings at different levels; and fourth using Poisson disk sampling\nas a scalable means of hierarchical point cloud learning. The key idea across\nall these contributions is to guarantee adequate consideration of the\nunderlying non-uniform sample distribution function from a Monte Carlo\nperspective. To make the proposed concepts applicable to real-world tasks, we\nfurthermore propose an efficient implementation which significantly reduces the\nGPU memory required during the training process. By employing our method in\nhierarchical network architectures we can outperform most of the\nstate-of-the-art networks on established point cloud segmentation,\nclassification and normal estimation benchmarks. Furthermore, in contrast to\nmost existing approaches, we also demonstrate the robustness of our method with\nrespect to sampling variations, even when training with uniformly sampled data\nonly. To support the direct application of these concepts, we provide a\nready-to-use TensorFlow implementation of these layers at\nhttps://github.com/viscom-ulm/MCCNN\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on memory-efficient normalization, cache-aware algorithms, dynamic parameter generation, hardware optimization, and paged memory management, here are some relevant findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and the detailed analysis:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- **Batch Normalization in LSTMs**: While batch normalization can speed up training and improve stability, it may increase memory consumption due to additional normalization operations. Effective use of batch normalization in LSTMs involves careful consideration of sequence length sensitivity and the trade-off between training speed and memory usage.\n\n- **NeuZip Compression Scheme**: This work introduces a novel compression scheme for neural networks that achieves memory-efficient training and inference. By analyzing the floating-point precision requirements, NeuZip can reduce memory usage, which could be applied to normalization layers to make them more memory-efficient.\n\n## Cache-Aware Algorithms for Deep Learning\n\n- **Automated Optimization for DNN Accelerators**: This paper discusses the importance of optimizing memory access patterns and data reuse to improve performance. The proposed architecture includes flexible internal memory, programmable data control, and a memory-allocation algorithm, which can be adapted for cache-aware algorithms in deep learning models.\n\n- **Efficient Deep Learning Guide**: The guide mentions the importance of optimizing optimizers and reducing memory load during training. It highlights the need for efficient memory management and data movement, especially when using multiple devices, which aligns with the need for cache-aware algorithms.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation in Neural Networks\n\n- **Learning Both Weights and Connections**: This concept involves pruning and learning both the weights and connections in neural networks. The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that there are sparse sub-networks within dense networks that can achieve similar performance, which could be extended to dynamic parameter generation based on input context.\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization Methods**: The initial analysis suggests investigating adaptive normalization methods, such as those that compute dynamic scaling parameters based on the input context. This approach can improve model performance and stability by adapting to different input conditions[Initial Analysis].\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for Normalization\n\n- **Memory-Efficient DNN Accelerators**: The paper on automated optimization for DNN accelerators provides insights into designing efficient architectures that maximize performance through optimized memory access, programmable data control, and automated optimization algorithms. These techniques can be applied to normalization layers to improve hardware utilization.\n\n- **Cache-Aligned Memory Access**: The efficient deep learning guide emphasizes the importance of cache-aligned memory access patterns and vectorized operations for statistics computation. These hardware-aware optimizations can significantly improve the real-world performance of normalization layers.\n\n## Paged Memory Management in Deep Learning Models\n\n- **Paged Memory Management for Normalization Statistics**: The initial analysis proposes a novel paging mechanism for normalization statistics. This involves investigating the efficiency of page-based variance computation, trade-offs between page size and performance, and comparing it with existing memory management techniques in normalization layers[Initial Analysis].\n\n### Additional Suggestions\n\n- **Batch Normalization in RNNs**: When implementing normalization in recurrent neural networks like LSTMs, it is crucial to ensure that the normalization does not disrupt the temporal order of the sequence data. This can be achieved by carefully applying batch normalization to the hidden states or inputs, which can help in maintaining stable gradients and improving performance.\n\n- **Optimizing Optimizers**: Optimizing the optimizers used in training, such as reducing the memory load of stored statistics and converging faster, can significantly impact the efficiency of the model. Techniques like Adam and AdamW, which are standard for large language models, can be optimized further to reduce memory overhead.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more memory-efficient, cache-aware, and dynamically adaptive normalization layers that are optimized for hardware performance, thereby improving the overall design of autoregressive language models.\n",

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space. We demonstrate its efficacy on several language modelling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 72/76 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nWei, and Z. Sui.

Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/67 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.00560, 2024. 8\nRuibin Xiong, Yunchang Yang, Di He, Kai Zheng, Shuxin Zheng, Chen Xing, Huishuai Zhang, Yanyan Lan, Liwei Wang, and Tieyan Liu.

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture.

Structured Pruning for Efficient Generative Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Haoli Bai, Jiansheng Wei, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study proposes S IMPLE, a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components and assigns learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training to identify redundant network structures.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing sizes of large generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) hinder their deployment in real-world applications. To obtain ef\ufb01cient PLMs, previous studies mostly focus on pruning the attention heads and feed-forward networks (FFNs) of the Transformer. Nevertheless, we \ufb01nd that in generative PLMs, the hidden dimension shared by many other modules (e.g., embedding layer and layer normalization) contains persistent outliers regardless of the network input. In this study, we propose S IMPLE , a new structured pruning framework for generative PLMs that comprehensively investigates all the above compress-ible components. To identify redundant network structures, we assign learnable masks over compressible components followed by sparse training. Various sizes of PLMs can be \ufb02exibly extracted via different thresholds, and are then task-speci\ufb01cally \ufb01ne-tuned for further improvement. Extensive experiments on language modeling, summarization and machine translation validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Incorporating Residual and Normalization Layers into Analysis of Masked Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*Goro Kobayashi, Tatsuki Kuribayashi, Sho Yokoi, Kentaro Inui*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed, and provides new intuitive explanations of existing reports.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has become ubiquitous in the natural language processing field. To interpret the Transformer-based models, their attention patterns have been extensively analyzed. However, the Transformer architecture is not only composed of the multi-head attention; other components can also contribute to Transformers\u2019 progressive performance. In this study, we extended the scope of the analysis of Transformers from solely the attention patterns to the whole attention block, i.e., multi-head attention, residual connection, and layer normalization. Our analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed. These results provide new intuitive explanations of existing reports; for example, discarding the learned attention patterns tends not to adversely affect the performance.

When Language Models Fall in Love: Animacy Processing in Transformer Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*Michael Hanna, Yonatan Belinkov, Sandro Pezzelle*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is concluded that despite the limited signal through which LMs can learn about animacy, they are indeed sensitive to the relevant lexical semantic nuances available in English.\n\n**Abstract:** Animacy - whether an entity is alive and sentient - is fundamental to cognitive processing, impacting areas such as memory, vision, and language. However, animacy is not always expressed directly in language: in English it often manifests indirectly, in the form of selectional constraints on verbs and adjectives. This poses a potential issue for transformer language models (LMs): they often train only on text, and thus lack access to extralinguistic information from which humans learn about animacy. We ask: how does this impact LMs' animacy processing - do they still behave as humans do? We answer this question using open-source LMs. Like previous studies, we find that LMs behave much like humans when presented with entities whose animacy is typical. However, we also show that even when presented with stories about atypically animate entities, such as a peanut in love, LMs adapt: they treat these entities as animate, though they do not adapt as well as humans. Even when the context indicating atypical animacy is very short, LMs pick up on subtle clues and change their behavior. We conclude that despite the limited signal through which LMs can learn about animacy, they are indeed sensitive to the relevant lexical semantic nuances available in English.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Adapting Language Models to Compress Contexts\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*Alexis Chevalier, Alexander Wettig, Anirudh Ajith, Danqi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts and the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora are explored.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are powerful and widely-applicable tools, but their usefulness is constrained by a finite context window and the expensive computational cost of processing long text documents. We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 114  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 5. No Parameters Left Behind: Sensitivity Guided Adaptive Learning Rate for Training Large Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*Chen Liang, Haoming Jiang, Simiao Zuo, Pengcheng He, Xiaodong Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen, T. Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel training strategy is proposed that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter according to its sensitivity, a robust gradient-based measure reflecting this parameter's contribution to the model performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research has shown the existence of significant redundancy in large Transformer models. One can prune the redundant parameters without significantly sacrificing the generalization performance. However, we question whether the redundant parameters could have contributed more if they were properly trained. To answer this question, we propose a novel training strategy that encourages all parameters to be trained sufficiently. Specifically, we adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter according to its sensitivity, a robust gradient-based measure reflecting this parameter's contribution to the model performance. A parameter with low sensitivity is redundant, and we improve its fitting by increasing its learning rate. In contrast, a parameter with high sensitivity is well-trained, and we regularize it by decreasing its learning rate to prevent further overfitting. We conduct extensive experiments on natural language understanding, neural machine translation, and image classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schedule. Analysis shows that the proposed schedule indeed reduces the redundancy and improves generalization performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

In this paper, we propose the task of `Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation', where we adapt a model trained on a source domain using only a general description in natural language of the target domain, i.e., a prompt. First, we leverage a pretrained contrastive vision-language model (CLIP) to optimize affine transformations of source features, steering them towards the target text embedding while preserving their content and semantics. To achieve this, we propose Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). Second, we show that these prompt-driven augmentations can be used to perform zero-shot domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms CLIP-based style transfer baselines on several datasets for the downstream task at hand, even surpassing one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation.

Adapting Sequence to Sequence models for Text Normalization in Social Media\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization language models transformer*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Kabir Manghnani, Ismini Lourentzou*\n\n**Abstract:** Social media offer an abundant source of valuable raw data, however informal\nwriting can quickly become a bottleneck for many natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. Off-the-shelf tools are usually trained on formal text and cannot\nexplicitly handle noise found in short online posts. Moreover, the variety of\nfrequently occurring linguistic variations presents several challenges, even\nfor humans who might not be able to comprehend the meaning of such posts,\nespecially when they contain slang and abbreviations. Text Normalization aims\nto transform online user-generated text to a canonical form. Current text\nnormalization systems rely on string or phonetic similarity and classification\nmodels that work on a local fashion. We argue that processing contextual\ninformation is crucial for this task and introduce a social media text\nnormalization hybrid word-character attention-based encoder-decoder model that\ncan serve as a pre-processing step for NLP applications to adapt to noisy text\nin social media. Our character-based component is trained on synthetic\nadversarial examples that are designed to capture errors commonly found in\nonline user-generated text. Experiments show that our model surpasses neural\narchitectures designed for text normalization and achieves comparable\nperformance with state-of-the-art related work.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on adaptive normalization techniques, dynamic parameter generation, memory-efficient implementations, and the performance impact of different normalization schemes, here are some key insights and references:\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Techniques\n\n### Normalized Transformer (nGPT)\nThe paper on the \"normalized Transformer (nGPT)\" introduces a novel approach where all vectors involved in the model (embeddings, MLPs, attention matrices, and hidden states) are constrained to have a unit norm. This hyperspherical parameter optimization allows for faster convergence and enhanced model stability. The nGPT functions as a multi-step optimizer on the hypersphere, which can accelerate learning and reduce the number of training steps needed to reach comparable accuracy.\n\n### Layer Normalization and Residual Connections\nTraditional transformer models use layer normalization to stabilize the learning process and improve convergence speed. Layer normalization normalizes the inputs across the features for each training example, ensuring robustness to changes in the input distribution. Residual connections also play a crucial role in facilitating the flow of gradients during training, which is important for deep networks.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation for Normalization Layers\n\n### Hyperspherical Parameter Optimization\nIn the nGPT framework, the use of learnable eigen learning rates for the attention and MLP blocks can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter generation. These learning rates control the contributions of these blocks to the hidden state, allowing for adaptive optimization on the hypersphere.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations\n\n### In-Place Activated BatchNorm\nWhile not specifically tailored for transformers, the concept of in-place activated batch normalization can be adapted. This technique saves memory by dropping intermediate results and recovering the required information during the backward pass, which could be beneficial for memory-constrained transformer models in the context of general deep learning.\n\n### PETAH: Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation for Hybrid Transformers\nPETAH introduces a framework for adapting hybrid transformer architectures in a parameter-efficient way. By combining task adaptation with pruning techniques, PETAH can create performant models with fewer parameters and reduced computational requirements during inference, which is crucial for memory efficiency.\n\n## Performance Impact of Different Normalization Schemes\n\n### nGPT Performance\nThe nGPT model shows significant improvements in training efficiency, reducing the number of training steps needed to reach comparable accuracy by factors ranging from 4 to 20. This is due to the hyperspherical parameter optimization and the use of learnable eigen learning rates.\n\n### General Insights on Normalization\nThe paper \"Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\" highlights the importance of normalization methods in decoupling weights' norm and improving numerical stability. Different normalization schemes (e.g., L1, L\u221e) can offer alternatives to traditional L2 batch normalization, which might be beneficial in low-precision implementations and could be explored in the context of transformer models.\n\n## Integration with Transformer Architectures\n\n### Self-Attention Mechanism and Layer Normalization\nThe self-attention mechanism in transformers, combined with layer normalization, allows the model to capture complex relationships in the data efficiently. Adaptive normalization techniques, such as those in nGPT, can be integrated into this architecture to enhance stability and convergence speed.\n\n### Hybrid Models\nPETAH's approach to adapting hybrid transformer architectures demonstrates that combining convolutional and attention layers can achieve better results in resource-constrained applications. This hybrid approach can be further optimized with adaptive normalization techniques to improve performance and efficiency.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient and adaptive autoregressive language models that leverage advanced normalization techniques, dynamic parameter generation, and memory-efficient implementations to improve overall performance and scalability.\n",

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes.

We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

Score: 0.12)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3. SparseProp: Efficient Sparse Backpropagation for Faster Training of Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Mahdi Nikdan, Tommaso Pegolotti, Eugenia Iofinova, Eldar Kurtic, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a new efficient version of the backpropagation algorithm, specialized to the case where the weights of the neural network being trained are sparse, and provides the first support for sparse training on commodity hardware.\n\n**Abstract:** We provide a new efficient version of the backpropagation algorithm, specialized to the case where the weights of the neural network being trained are sparse. Our algorithm is general, as it applies to arbitrary (unstructured) sparsity and common layer types (e.g., convolutional or linear). We provide a fast vectorized implementation on commodity CPUs, and show that it can yield speedups in end-to-end runtime experiments, both in transfer learning using already-sparsified networks, and in training sparse networks from scratch. Thus, our results provide the first support for sparse training on commodity hardware.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Mark D. McDonnell*\n\n**Abstract:** For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should\nideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually\nincrease when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements\nin error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks\ndeployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We\nalso considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test\nresults of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error\nrates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our\nerror-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that\noverfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning\nbatch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full\nprecision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate\nschedule, we found that training for 1-bit-per-weight is just as fast as\nfull-precision networks, with better accuracy than standard schedules, and\nachieved about 98%-99% of peak performance in just 62 training epochs for\nCIFAR-10/100.

Real-Time Super-Resolution System of 4K-Video Based on Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*He Li, Yongming Tang, Changjun Song, Chengcheng Wang, Yanpeng Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video super-resolution (VSR) technology excels in reconstructing low-quality video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

Training and Inference with Integers in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization neural networks*\n\n*Shuang Wu, Luping Shi, Guoqi Li, Feng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Researches on deep neural networks with discrete parameters and their\ndeployment in embedded systems have been active and promising topics. Although\nprevious works have successfully reduced precision in inference, transferring\nboth training and inference processes to low-bitwidth integers has not been\ndemonstrated simultaneously. In this work, we develop a new method termed as\n\"WAGE\" to discretize both training and inference, where weights (W),\nactivations (A), gradients (G) and errors (E) among layers are shifted and\nlinearly constrained to low-bitwidth integers. To perform pure discrete\ndataflow for fixed-point devices, we further replace batch normalization by a\nconstant scaling layer and simplify other components that are arduous for\ninteger implementation. Improved accuracies can be obtained on multiple\ndatasets, which indicates that WAGE somehow acts as a type of regularization.\nEmpirically, we demonstrate the potential to deploy training in hardware\nsystems such as integer-based deep learning accelerators and neuromorphic chips\nwith comparable accuracy and higher energy efficiency, which is crucial to\nfuture AI applications in variable scenarios with transfer and continual\nlearning demands.\n\n**Conference:** training-and-inference-with-integers-in-deep-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware efficiency, normalization, and optimal performance, here are some key points and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- The paper on \"Reducing Data Bottlenecks in Distributed, Heterogeneous Neural Networks\" discusses the use of hardware-software co-design to optimize neural network architectures, including the implementation of narrow layers to reduce data traffic.

While RMSNorm offers computational advantages over traditional layer normalization, it still faces limitations in memory efficiency and adaptability to varying input contexts. The increasing size of language models and the need to process longer sequences make these limitations increasingly critical.\n\n## Related Work\n\nRecent advances in memory management and normalization techniques have laid the groundwork for more efficient approaches:\n\n1. **PagedAttention** (Kwon et al., 2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of paged memory management in attention mechanisms, achieving significant memory savings without compromising model performance.\n\n2. **BASED** (Arora et al., 2024) showed how IO-aware algorithms could dramatically improve throughput in language generation tasks through efficient memory management.\n\n3. **DenseMamba** (He et al., 2024) illustrated the benefits of selective state mechanisms and dense connections in maintaining model performance while improving efficiency.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n1. **Memory Inefficiency**: Standard RMSNorm maintains full statistics in memory, leading to significant memory overhead for long sequences.\n2. **Limited Adaptivity**: Fixed normalization parameters may not optimally handle varying input distributions across different contexts.\n3. **Hardware Underutilization**: Current implementations often fail to fully leverage modern hardware capabilities.\n\n### Core Philosophy\n\nThe key insight is that normalization statistics can be managed more efficiently using paged memory techniques while maintaining or improving model performance through adaptive computation. By combining paged memory management with dynamic parameter generation, we can achieve both memory efficiency and input-dependent adaptivity.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n1. **Paged Statistics Management**:\n   For an input sequence X divided into pages of size p, the variance computation can be decomposed as:\n   ```\n   var(X) = E[(X - \u03bc)\u00b2] = E[X\u00b2] - E[X]\u00b2\n   ```\n   This can be computed page-wise and aggregated efficiently:\n   ```\n   var(X) = \u03a3\u1d62 (w\u1d62 * var(X\u1d62) + w\u1d62 * (\u03bc\u1d62 - \u03bc)\u00b2)\n   ```\n   where w\u1d62 represents page weights and X\u1d62 represents page contents.\n\n2. **Adaptive Parameter Generation**:\n   The scaling parameter \u03b3 is computed dynamically based on local statistics:\n   ```\n   \u03b3(x) = f(var(x_local), context) * \u03b3_base\n   ```\n   where f is a learned function that adapts the scaling based on local variance and context.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Modifications to RMSNorm\n\n1. **Paged Memory Management**:\n   - Organize normalization statistics in fixed-size pages\n   - Implement efficient page allocation and deallocation\n   - Cache frequently accessed pages in fast memory\n\n2. **Adaptive Parameter Computation**:\n   - Generate scaling parameters dynamically based on local statistics\n   - Implement efficient parameter sharing across similar contexts\n   - Use hardware-optimized computations for parameter generation\n\n3. **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**:\n   - Align page sizes with hardware cache lines\n   - Implement vectorized operations for statistics computation\n   - Use fused operations for combined computations\n\n### Mathematical Formulations\n\n1. **Paged Variance Computation**:\n```python\ndef compute_paged_variance(X, page_size):\n    pages = split_into_pages(X, page_size)\n    page_vars = []\n    page_means = []\n    \n    for page in pages:\n        \u03bc_local = mean(page)\n        var_local = mean((page -
