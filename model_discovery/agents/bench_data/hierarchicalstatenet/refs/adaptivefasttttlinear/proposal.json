Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/21 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1525-1534, Berlin, Germany, August 2016.

Redesigning the Transformer Architecture with Insights from Multi-particle Dynamical Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ordinary differential equations for GAU\"*\n\n*Subhabrata Dutta, Tanya Gautam, Soumen Chakrabarti, Tanmoy Chakraborty*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the problem of approximating the two central components of the Transformer -- multi-head self-attention and point-wise feed-forward transformation, with reduced parameter space and computational complexity, and forms a temporal evolution scheme, TransEvolve, to bypass costly dot-product attention over multiple stacked layers.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer and its variants have been proven to be efficient sequence learners in many different domains. Despite their staggering success, a critical issue has been the enormous number of parameters that must be trained (ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{11}$) along with the quadratic complexity of dot-product attention. In this work, we investigate the problem of approximating the two central components of the Transformer -- multi-head self-attention and point-wise feed-forward transformation, with reduced parameter space and computational complexity. We build upon recent developments in analyzing deep neural networks as numerical solvers of ordinary differential equations. Taking advantage of an analogy between Transformer stages and the evolution of a dynamical system of multiple interacting particles, we formulate a temporal evolution scheme, TransEvolve, to bypass costly dot-product attention over multiple stacked layers. We perform exhaustive experiments with TransEvolve on well-known encoder-decoder as well as encoder-only tasks. We observe that the degree of approximation (or inversely, the degree of parameter reduction) has different effects on the performance, depending on the task. While in the encoder-decoder regime, TransEvolve delivers performances comparable to the original Transformer, in encoder-only tasks it consistently outperforms Transformer along with several subsequent variants.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Duvenaud*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations, which allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 4313  (*Influential: 955*)\n\n#### 3.

Marion*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work considers a large family of parameterized ODEs with continuous-in-time parameters, which include time-dependent neural ODES, and derives a generalization bound for this class by a Lipschitz-based argument.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular family of continuous-depth deep learning models. In this work, we consider a large family of parameterized ODEs with continuous-in-time parameters, which include time-dependent neural ODEs. We derive a generalization bound for this class by a Lipschitz-based argument. By leveraging the analogy between neural ODEs and deep residual networks, our approach yields in particular a generalization bound for a class of deep residual networks. The bound involves the magnitude of the difference between successive weight matrices. We illustrate numerically how this quantity affects the generalization capability of neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Towards Adaptive Prefix Tuning for Parameter-Efficient Language Model Fine-tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient gating mechanisms for convolution-based language models\"*\n\n*Zhenru Zhang, Chuanqi Tan, Haiyang Xu, Chengyu Wang, Jun Huang, Songfang Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT), which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers that will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pre-trained language models on various downstream tasks with whole parameters is prohibitively expensive. Hence, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has attracted attention that only optimizes a few task-specific parameters with the frozen pre-trained model. In this work, we focus on prefix tuning, which only optimizes continuous prefix vectors (i.e. pseudo tokens) inserted into Transformer layers. Based on the observation that the learned syntax and semantics representation varies a lot at different layers, we argue that the adaptive prefix will be further tailored to each layer than the fixed one, enabling the fine-tuning more effective and efficient. Thus, we propose Adaptive Prefix Tuning (APT) to adjust the prefix in terms of both fine-grained token level and coarse-grained layer level with a gate mechanism. Experiments on the SuperGLUE and NER datasets show the effectiveness of APT. In addition, taking the gate as a probing, we validate the efficiency and effectiveness of the variable prefix.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6.

Lim, Jiwen Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Recursive Gated Convolution, a new operation that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs, is presented that can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress in vision Transformers exhibits great success in various tasks driven by the new spatial modeling mechanism based on dot-product self-attention. In this paper, we show that the key ingredients behind the vision Transformers, namely input-adaptive, long-range and high-order spatial interactions, can also be efficiently implemented with a convolution-based framework. We present the Recursive Gated Convolution ($\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv) that performs high-order spatial interactions with gated convolutions and recursive designs. The new operation is highly flexible and customizable, which is compatible with various variants of convolution and extends the two-order interactions in self-attention to arbitrary orders without introducing significant extra computation. $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve various vision Transformers and convolution-based models. Based on the operation, we construct a new family of generic vision backbones named HorNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and ADE20K semantic segmentation show HorNet outperform Swin Transformers and ConvNeXt by a significant margin with similar overall architecture and training configurations. HorNet also shows favorable scalability to more training data and larger model sizes. Apart from the effectiveness in visual encoders, we also show $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be applied to task-specific decoders and consistently improve dense prediction performance with less computation. Our results demonstrate that $\\textit{g}^\\textit{n}$Conv can be a new basic module for visual modeling that effectively combines the merits of both vision Transformers and CNNs.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

In this paper we propose an alternative by directly modeling the solution curves - the flow of an ODE - with a neural network. This immediately eliminates the need for expensive numerical solvers while still maintaining the modeling capability of neural ODEs. We propose several flow architectures suitable for different applications by establishing precise conditions on when a function defines a valid flow.

DialogConv: A Lightweight Fully Convolutional Network for Multi-view Response Selection\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Yongkang Liu, Shi Feng, Wei Gao, Daling Wang, Yifei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection, exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response.\n\n**Abstract:** Current end-to-end retrieval-based dialogue systems are mainly based on Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformers with attention mechanisms. Although promising results have been achieved, these models often suffer from slow inference or huge number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection. DialogConv is exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response. Dialogues are modeled in 3D views, where DialogConv performs convolution operations on embedding view, word view and utterance view to capture richer semantic information from multiple contextual views. On the four benchmark datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, DialogConv is on average about 8.5x smaller in size, and 79.39x and 10.64x faster on CPU and GPU devices, respectively. At the same time, DialogConv achieves the competitive effectiveness of response selection.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 10. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n### 11 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Lory: Fully Differentiable Mixture-of-Experts for Autoregressive\n  Language Model Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts in convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Zexuan Zhong, Mengzhou Xia, Danqi Chen, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-experts (MoE) models facilitate efficient scaling; however,\ntraining the router network introduces the challenge of optimizing a\nnon-differentiable, discrete objective. Recently, a fully-differentiable MoE\narchitecture, SMEAR, was proposed (Muqeeth et al., 2023), which softly merges\nexperts in the parameter space; nevertheless, its effectiveness was only\ndemonstrated in downstream fine-tuning on classification tasks. In this paper,\nwe present Lory, the first approach that scales such architectures to\nautoregressive language model pre-training. Lory introduces two key techniques:\n(1) a causal segment routing strategy that achieves high efficiency for expert\nmerging operations while preserving the autoregressive nature of language\nmodels; (2) a similarity-based data batching method that encourages expert\nspecialization by grouping similar documents in training instances. We\npre-train a series of Lory models on 150B tokens from scratch, with up to 32\nexperts and 30B (1.5B active) parameters. Experimental results show significant\nperformance gains over parameter-matched dense models on both perplexity\n(+13.9%) and a variety of downstream tasks (+1.5%-11.1%). Despite segment-level\nrouting, Lory models achieve competitive performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art MoE models with token-level routing. We further demonstrate\nthat the trained experts in Lory capture domain-level specialization without\nsupervision. Our work highlights the potential of fully-differentiable MoE\narchitectures for language model pre-training and advocates future research in\nthis area.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-06T03:06:33Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-19T06:45:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mixture of Tokens: Continuous MoE through Cross-Example Aggregation\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts in convolutional autoregressive units\"*\n\n*Szymon Antoniak, Micha\u0142 Krutul, Maciej Pi\u00f3ro, Jakub Krajewski, Jan Ludziejewski, Kamil Ciebiera, Krystian Kr\u00f3l, Tomasz Odrzyg\u00f3\u017ad\u017a, Marek Cygan, Sebastian Jaszczur*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture of Experts (MoE) models based on Transformer architecture are pushing\nthe boundaries of language and vision tasks. The allure of these models lies in\ntheir ability to substantially increase the parameter count without a\ncorresponding increase in FLOPs. Most widely adopted MoE models are\ndiscontinuous with respect to their parameters - often referred to as sparse.\nAt the same time, existing continuous MoE designs either lag behind their\nsparse counterparts or are incompatible with autoregressive decoding. Motivated\nby the observation that the adaptation of fully continuous methods has been an\noverarching trend in deep learning, we develop Mixture of Tokens (MoT), a\nsimple, continuous architecture that is capable of scaling the number of\nparameters similarly to sparse MoE models. Unlike conventional methods, MoT\nassigns mixtures of tokens from different examples to each expert. This\narchitecture is fully compatible with autoregressive training and generation.\nOur best models not only achieve a 3x increase in training speed over dense\nTransformer models in language pretraining but also match the performance of\nstate-of-the-art MoE architectures. Additionally, a close connection between\nMoT and MoE is demonstrated through a novel technique we call transition\ntuning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-24T16:03:57Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-24T14:40:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ordinary differential equations for GAU\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for\n  Social Media Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ordinary differential equations for GAU\"*\n\n*Maunika Tamire, Srinivas Anumasa, P. K. Srijith*\n\n**Abstract:** Classification of posts in social media such as Twitter is difficult due to\nthe noisy and short nature of texts. Sequence classification models based on\nrecurrent neural networks (RNN) are popular for classifying posts that are\nsequential in nature. RNNs assume the hidden representation dynamics to evolve\nin a discrete manner and do not consider the exact time of the posting. In this\nwork, we propose to use recurrent neural ordinary differential equations\n(RNODE) for social media post classification which consider the time of posting\nand allow the computation of hidden representation to evolve in a\ntime-sensitive continuous manner. In addition, we propose a novel model,\nBi-directional RNODE (Bi-RNODE), which can consider the information flow in\nboth the forward and backward directions of posting times to predict the post\nlabel. Our experiments demonstrate that RNODE and Bi-RNODE are effective for\nthe problem of stance classification of rumours in social media.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-23T19:20:19Z  (*Updated: 2021-12-23T19:20:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient gating mechanisms for convolution-based language models\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient gating mechanisms for convolution-based language models\"*\n\n*Zihao Zeng, Bokai Lin, Tianqi Hou, Hao Zhang, Zhijie Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** The KV-Cache technique has become the standard for the inference of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). It caches states of self-attention to avoid\nrecomputation. Yet, it is widely criticized that KV-Cache can become a\nbottleneck of the LLM inference system, especially when confronted with\nultra-large models and long-context queries. A natural remedy is to discard the\nKV-Cache for less important tokens, with StreamingLLM as an example, but the\nused static eviction strategies cannot flexibly adapt to varying contexts.\nRemedies like H2O leverage accumulative attention scores to perform dynamic\neviction but suffer from the attention bias issue in capturing contextual\ninformation. This paper bridges this gap by devising a parameterized KV-Cache\neviction mechanism, dubbed as Attention-Gate, which accepts the whole context\nas input and yields eviction flags for each token to realize in-context\neviction. The subsequent self-attention module proceeds according to the flags\nand only the KV states for the remaining tokens need to be cached. The\nAttention-Gates can vary among different heads and layers and be trivially\nplugged into pre-trained LLMs, tuned by cost-effective continual pre-training\nor supervised fine-tuning objectives to acquire what to discard. The\ncomputational and memory overhead introduced by Attention-Gates is minimal. Our\nmethod is validated across multiple tasks, demonstrating both efficiency and\nadaptability. After a highly efficient continual pre-training, it achieves\nhigher average accuracy and evicts more tokens compared to traditional\ntraining-free methods. In supervised fine-tuning, it not only evicts many\ntokens but also outperforms LoRA-finetuned LLMs on some datasets, such as RTE,\nwhere it improves accuracy by 13.9% while evicting 62.8% of tokens, showing\nthat effective eviction of redundant tokens can even enhance performance.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-15T05:01:19Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-19T08:45:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7. Taming Sparsely Activated Transformer with Stochastic Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Young Jin Kim, Hany Hassan, Ruofei Zhang, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can\neasily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without\nsignificant increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be\nparameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better\nperformance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by\nexploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such\nresearch might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used\nrouting methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly\nrouting inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model,\nTHOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models,\nsuch as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each\ninput during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a\nconsistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data\nbut also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make\nconsistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine\ntranslation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient\nin that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across\nvarious settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms\nthe Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as\nthat of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

StableMoE: Stable Routing Strategy for Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Damai Dai, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Bo Zheng, Zhifang Sui, Baobao Chang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique can scale up the model size of\nTransformers with an affordable computational overhead. We point out that\nexisting learning-to-route MoE methods suffer from the routing fluctuation\nissue, i.e., the target expert of the same input may change along with\ntraining, but only one expert will be activated for the input during inference.\nThe routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input\nupdates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we\npropose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation\nproblem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing\nstrategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone\nmodel. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to\ndetermine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing\nstrategy. We validate our method on language modeling and multilingual machine\ntranslation. The results show that StableMoE outperforms existing MoE methods\nin terms of both convergence speed and performance.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-18T16:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2022-04-18T16:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 9.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 11.

Multi-view Depth Estimation using Epipolar Spatio-Temporal Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Wenping Wang, Christian Theobalt, Wei Li, Lingjie Liu, Xiaoxiao Long*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel method for multi-view depth estimation from a single video, which is a critical task in various applications, such as perception, reconstruction and robot navigation. Although previous learning-based methods have demonstrated compelling results, most works estimate depth maps of individual video frames independently, without taking into consideration the strong geometric and temporal coherence among the frames. Moreover, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models mostly adopt a fully 3D convolution network for cost regularization and therefore require high computational cost, thus limiting their deployment in real-world applications. Our method achieves temporally coherent depth estimation results by using a novel Epipolar Spatio-Temporal (EST) transformer to explicitly associate geometric and temporal correlation with multiple estimated depth maps. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, inspired by recent Mixture-of-Experts models, we design a compact hybrid network consisting of a 2D context-aware network and a 3D matching network which learn 2D context information and 3D disparity cues separately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in depth estimation and significant speedup than the SOTA methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-26\n\n\n\n#### 4. Large Multi-modality Model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min, Zhichao Zhang, Yanwei Jiang, Jun Jia, ZiCheng Zhang, Wei Sun, Puyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional deep neural network (DNN)-based image quality assessment (IQA) models leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) or Transformer to learn the quality-aware feature representation, achieving commendable performance on natural scene images. However, when applied to AI-Generated images (AGIs), these DNN-based IQA models exhibit subpar performance. This situation is largely due to the semantic inaccuracies inherent in certain AGIs caused by uncontrollable nature of the generation process. Thus, the capability to discern semantic content becomes crucial for assessing the quality of AGIs. Traditional DNN-based IQA models, constrained by limited parameter complexity and training data, struggle to capture complex fine-grained semantic features, making it challenging to grasp the existence and coherence of semantic content of the entire image. To address the shortfall in semantic content perception of current IQA models, we introduce a large Multi-modality model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (MA-AGIQA) model, which utilizes semantically informed guidance to sense semantic information and extract semantic vectors through carefully designed text prompts. Moreover, it employs a mixture of experts (MoE) structure to dynamically integrate the semantic information with the quality-aware features extracted by traditional DNN-based IQA models. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two AI-generated content datasets, AIGCQA-20k and AGIQA-3k show that MA-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, and demonstrate its superior generalization capabilities on assessing the quality of AGIs.

Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Qiang Liu, Chengyue Gong, Xingchao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present rectified flow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions \\pi_0 and \\pi_1, hence providing a unified solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 6. A Neural State-Space Model Approach to Efficient Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Eng Siong Chng, Pin-Jui Ku, Yuchen Hu, Kai Li, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Chen Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce S4M, a new efficient speech separation framework based on neural state-space models (SSM). Motivated by linear time-invariant systems for sequence modeling, our SSM-based approach can efficiently model input signals into a format of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for representation learning. To extend the SSM technique into speech separation tasks, we first decompose the input mixture into multi-scale representations with different resolutions. This mechanism enables S4M to learn globally coherent separation and reconstruction. The experimental results show that S4M performs comparably to other separation backbones in terms of SI-SDRi, while having a much lower model complexity with significantly fewer trainable parameters. In addition, our S4M-tiny model (1.8M parameters) even surpasses attention-based Sepformer (26.0M parameters) in noisy conditions with only 9.2 of multiply-accumulate operation (MACs).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-26\n\n\n\n#### 7. Task-Specific Normalization for Continual Learning of Blind Image Quality Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Xiaokang Yang, Guangtao Zhai, Kede Ma, Weixia Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off, and task-order/-length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze all convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an explicit promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters for plasticity. We assign each new IQA dataset (i.e., task) a prediction head, and load the corresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final quality estimate is computed by black a weighted summation of predictions from all heads with a lightweight $K$-means gating mechanism. Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques for BIQA.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates \"mixture of experts in convolutional autoregressive units,\" \"neural ordinary differential equations for GAU,\" and \"efficient gating mechanisms for convolution-based language models,\" here are some key insights and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Mixture of Experts in Convolutional Autoregressive Units\n\n- The concept of Mixture of Experts (MoE) can be integrated into convolutional GAUs to enhance model capacity and adaptability.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1312.4461, 2013.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value and the lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior abilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Neural Flows: Efficient Alternative to Neural ODEs\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Marin Bilovs, Johanna Sommer, Syama Sundar Rangapuram, Tim Januschowski, Stephan Gunnemann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper directly modeling the solution curves - the flow of an ODE - with a neural network immediately eliminates the need for expensive numerical solvers while still maintaining the modeling capability of neural ODEs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations describe how values change in time. This is the reason why they gained importance in modeling sequential data, especially when the observations are made at irregular intervals. In this paper we propose an alternative by directly modeling the solution curves - the flow of an ODE - with a neural network. This immediately eliminates the need for expensive numerical solvers while still maintaining the modeling capability of neural ODEs. We propose several flow architectures suitable for different applications by establishing precise conditions on when a function defines a valid flow. Apart from computational efficiency, we also provide empirical evidence of favorable generalization performance via applications in time series modeling, forecasting, and density estimation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 4.

Although promising results have been achieved, these models often suffer from slow inference or huge number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel lightweight fully convolutional architecture, called DialogConv, for response selection. DialogConv is exclusively built on top of convolution to extract matching features of context and response. Dialogues are modeled in 3D views, where DialogConv performs convolution operations on embedding view, word view and utterance view to capture richer semantic information from multiple contextual views. On the four benchmark datasets, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, DialogConv is on average about 8.5x smaller in size, and 79.39x and 10.64x faster on CPU and GPU devices, respectively. At the same time, DialogConv achieves the competitive effectiveness of response selection.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently.

Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development. One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. MVMoE: Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver with Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"advanced routing mechanisms mixture of experts\"*\n\n*Jianan Zhou, Zhiguang Cao, Yaoxin Wu, Wen Song, Yining Ma, Jie Zhang, Chi Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation, and develops a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention. However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE, delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity. Experimentally, our method significantly promotes zero-shot generalization performance on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting and real-world benchmark instances. We further conduct extensive studies on the effect of MoE configurations in solving VRPs, and observe the superiority of hierarchical gating when facing out-of-distribution data.

For dense models, increasing their size proportionally increases their computational footprint. In this work, we seek to aggressively decouple learning capacity and FLOPs through Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style models with large knowledge-rich vocabulary based routing functions. Our proposed approach, dubbed Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE), can be seen as a memory augmented model, where a large set of word-specific experts play the role of a sparse memory. We demonstrate that MoWE performs significantly better than the T5 family of models with similar number of FLOPs in a variety of NLP tasks. Moreover, MoWE outperforms traditional MoE models on knowledge intensive tasks and has similar performance to complex memory augmented approaches that often require to invoke custom mechanisms to search the sparse memory.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*Mingxing Tan, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new scaling method is proposed that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient and is demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*P. Marion, Yu-Han Wu, Michael E.

Their continuous-depth analog, neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), are also widely used. Despite their success, the link between the discrete and continuous models still lacks a solid mathematical foundation. In this article, we take a step in this direction by establishing an implicit regularization of deep residual networks towards neural ODEs, for nonlinear networks trained with gradient flow. We prove that if the network is initialized as a discretization of a neural ODE, then such a discretization holds throughout training. Our results are valid for a finite training time, and also as the training time tends to infinity provided that the network satisfies a Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Importantly, this condition holds for a family of residual networks where the residuals are two-layer perceptrons with an overparameterization in width that is only linear, and implies the convergence of gradient flow to a global minimum.

Taming Sparsely Activated Transformer with Stochastic Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Young Jin Kim, Hany Hassan, Ruofei Zhang, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated models (SAMs), such as Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), can\neasily scale to have outrageously large amounts of parameters without\nsignificant increase in computational cost. However, SAMs are reported to be\nparameter inefficient such that larger models do not always lead to better\nperformance. While most on-going research focuses on improving SAMs models by\nexploring methods of routing inputs to experts, our analysis reveals that such\nresearch might not lead to the solution we expect, i.e., the commonly-used\nrouting methods based on gating mechanisms do not work better than randomly\nrouting inputs to experts. In this paper, we propose a new expert-based model,\nTHOR (Transformer witH StOchastic ExpeRts). Unlike classic expert-based models,\nsuch as the Switch Transformer, experts in THOR are randomly activated for each\ninput during training and inference. THOR models are trained using a\nconsistency regularized loss, where experts learn not only from training data\nbut also from other experts as teachers, such that all the experts make\nconsistent predictions. We validate the effectiveness of THOR on machine\ntranslation tasks. Results show that THOR models are more parameter efficient\nin that they significantly outperform the Transformer and MoE models across\nvarious settings. For example, in multilingual translation, THOR outperforms\nthe Switch Transformer by 2 BLEU scores, and obtains the same BLEU score as\nthat of a state-of-the-art MoE model that is 18 times larger.

StableMoE: Stable Routing Strategy for Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Damai Dai, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Bo Zheng, Zhifang Sui, Baobao Chang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique can scale up the model size of\nTransformers with an affordable computational overhead. We point out that\nexisting learning-to-route MoE methods suffer from the routing fluctuation\nissue, i.e., the target expert of the same input may change along with\ntraining, but only one expert will be activated for the input during inference.\nThe routing fluctuation tends to harm sample efficiency because the same input\nupdates different experts but only one is finally used. In this paper, we\npropose StableMoE with two training stages to address the routing fluctuation\nproblem. In the first training stage, we learn a balanced and cohesive routing\nstrategy and distill it into a lightweight router decoupled from the backbone\nmodel. In the second training stage, we utilize the distilled router to\ndetermine the token-to-expert assignment and freeze it for a stable routing\nstrategy. We validate our method on language modeling and multilingual machine\ntranslation. The results show that StableMoE outperforms existing MoE methods\nin terms of both convergence speed and performance.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-18T16:48:19Z  (*Updated: 2022-04-18T16:48:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

LUKE-Graph: A Transformer-based Approach with Gated Relational Graph\n  Attention for Cloze-style Reading Comprehension\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Shima Foolad, Kourosh Kiani*\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating prior knowledge can improve existing pre-training models in\ncloze-style machine reading and has become a new trend in recent studies.\nNotably, most of the existing models have integrated external knowledge graphs\n(KG) and transformer-based models, such as BERT into a unified data structure.\nHowever, selecting the most relevant ambiguous entities in KG and extracting\nthe best subgraph remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose the\nLUKE-Graph, a model that builds a heterogeneous graph based on the intuitive\nrelationships between entities in a document without using any external KG. We\nthen use a Relational Graph Attention (RGAT) network to fuse the graph's\nreasoning information and the contextual representation encoded by the\npre-trained LUKE model. In this way, we can take advantage of LUKE, to derive\nan entity-aware representation; and a graph model - to exploit relation-aware\nrepresentation. Moreover, we propose Gated-RGAT by augmenting RGAT with a\ngating mechanism that regulates the question information for the graph\nconvolution operation. This is very similar to human reasoning processing\nbecause they always choose the best entity candidate based on the question\ninformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the LUKE-Graph achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the ReCoRD dataset with commonsense reasoning.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-12T14:31:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

To account for these issues,\nlarger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions.\nIn this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight\nDynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local\ninteractions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We\nfurther develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph\nconvolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model\ncomplexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model\nwith fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments\ndemonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark\ndatasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-09T06:03:46Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-09T06:03:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7. On the Representation Collapse of Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"advanced routing mechanisms mixture of experts\"*\n\n*Zewen Chi, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Damai Dai, Shuming Ma, Barun Patra, Saksham Singhal, Payal Bajaj, Xia Song, Xian-Ling Mao, Heyan Huang, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of experts provides larger model capacity while requiring a\nconstant computational overhead. It employs the routing mechanism to distribute\ninput tokens to the best-matched experts according to their hidden\nrepresentations. However, learning such a routing mechanism encourages token\nclustering around expert centroids, implying a trend toward representation\ncollapse. In this work, we propose to estimate the routing scores between\ntokens and experts on a low-dimensional hypersphere. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on cross-lingual language model pre-training and fine-tuning on\ndownstream tasks. Experimental results across seven multilingual benchmarks\nshow that our method achieves consistent gains. We also present a comprehensive\nanalysis on the representation and routing behaviors of our models. Our method\nalleviates the representation collapse issue and achieves more consistent\nrouting than the baseline mixture-of-experts methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-20T01:40:19Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-12T10:17:55Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 8. A Hybrid Persian Sentiment Analysis Framework: Integrating Dependency\n  Grammar Based Rules and Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*Kia Dashtipour, Mandar Gogate, Jingpeng Li, Fengling Jiang, Bin Kong, Amir Hussain*\n\n**Abstract:** Social media hold valuable, vast and unstructured information on public\nopinion that can be utilized to improve products and services. The automatic\nanalysis of such data, however, requires a deep understanding of natural\nlanguage. Current sentiment analysis approaches are mainly based on word\nco-occurrence frequencies, which are inadequate in most practical cases. In\nthis work, we propose a novel hybrid framework for concept-level sentiment\nanalysis in Persian language, that integrates linguistic rules and deep\nlearning to optimize polarity detection. When a pattern is triggered, the\nframework allows sentiments to flow from words to concepts based on symbolic\ndependency relations. When no pattern is triggered, the framework switches to\nits subsymbolic counterpart and leverages deep neural networks (DNN) to perform\nthe classification. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches (including support vector machine, and logistic regression) and DNN\nclassifiers (long short-term memory, and Convolutional Neural Networks) with a\nmargin of 10-15% and 3-4% respectively, using benchmark Persian product and\nhotel reviews corpora.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-30T10:29:45Z  (*Updated: 2019-09-30T10:29:45Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 9. Encoding Syntactic Constituency Paths for Frame-Semantic Parsing with\n  Graph Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*Emanuele Bastianelli, Andrea Vanzo, Oliver Lemon*\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of integrating syntactic information from constituency\ntrees into a neural model in Frame-semantic parsing sub-tasks, namely Target\nIdentification (TI), FrameIdentification (FI), and Semantic Role Labeling\n(SRL). We use a Graph Convolutional Network to learn specific representations\nof constituents, such that each constituent is profiled as the production\ngrammar rule it corresponds to. We leverage these representations to build\nsyntactic features for each word in a sentence, computed as the sum of all the\nconstituents on the path between a word and a task-specific node in the tree,\ne.g. the target predicate for SRL. Our approach improves state-of-the-art\nresults on the TI and SRL of ~1%and~3.5% points, respectively (+2.5% additional\npoints are gained with BERT as input), when tested on FrameNet 1.5, while\nyielding comparable results on the CoNLL05 dataset to other syntax-aware\nsystems.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-26T10:10:57Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-26T10:10:57Z*)\n\n\n\n### 8 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-view Depth Estimation using Epipolar Spatio-Temporal Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Wenping Wang, Christian Theobalt, Wei Li, Lingjie Liu, Xiaoxiao Long*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel method for multi-view depth estimation from a single video, which is a critical task in various applications, such as perception, reconstruction and robot navigation. Although previous learning-based methods have demonstrated compelling results, most works estimate depth maps of individual video frames independently, without taking into consideration the strong geometric and temporal coherence among the frames. Moreover, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models mostly adopt a fully 3D convolution network for cost regularization and therefore require high computational cost, thus limiting their deployment in real-world applications. Our method achieves temporally coherent depth estimation results by using a novel Epipolar Spatio-Temporal (EST) transformer to explicitly associate geometric and temporal correlation with multiple estimated depth maps. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, inspired by recent Mixture-of-Experts models, we design a compact hybrid network consisting of a 2D context-aware network and a 3D matching network which learn 2D context information and 3D disparity cues separately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in depth estimation and significant speedup than the SOTA methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Large Multi-modality Model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment\n\n*From Search Query: \"mixture of experts convolutional transformers\"*\n\n*Guangtao Zhai, Xiongkuo Min, Zhichao Zhang, Yanwei Jiang, Jun Jia, ZiCheng Zhang, Wei Sun, Puyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional deep neural network (DNN)-based image quality assessment (IQA) models leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) or Transformer to learn the quality-aware feature representation, achieving commendable performance on natural scene images. However, when applied to AI-Generated images (AGIs), these DNN-based IQA models exhibit subpar performance. This situation is largely due to the semantic inaccuracies inherent in certain AGIs caused by uncontrollable nature of the generation process. Thus, the capability to discern semantic content becomes crucial for assessing the quality of AGIs. Traditional DNN-based IQA models, constrained by limited parameter complexity and training data, struggle to capture complex fine-grained semantic features, making it challenging to grasp the existence and coherence of semantic content of the entire image. To address the shortfall in semantic content perception of current IQA models, we introduce a large Multi-modality model Assisted AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment (MA-AGIQA) model, which utilizes semantically informed guidance to sense semantic information and extract semantic vectors through carefully designed text prompts. Moreover, it employs a mixture of experts (MoE) structure to dynamically integrate the semantic information with the quality-aware features extracted by traditional DNN-based IQA models. Comprehensive experiments conducted on two AI-generated content datasets, AIGCQA-20k and AGIQA-3k show that MA-AGIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance, and demonstrate its superior generalization capabilities on assessing the quality of AGIs.

Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Qiang Liu, Chengyue Gong, Xingchao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present rectified flow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions \\pi_0 and \\pi_1, hence providing a unified solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectified flow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efficient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectified flow from data, called rectification, turns an arbitrary coupling of \\pi_0 and \\pi_1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectification allows us to obtain a sequence of flows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectified flow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight flows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. A Neural State-Space Model Approach to Efficient Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs for efficient sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Eng Siong Chng, Pin-Jui Ku, Yuchen Hu, Kai Li, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Chen Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce S4M, a new efficient speech separation framework based on neural state-space models (SSM). Motivated by linear time-invariant systems for sequence modeling, our SSM-based approach can efficiently model input signals into a format of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for representation learning. To extend the SSM technique into speech separation tasks, we first decompose the input mixture into multi-scale representations with different resolutions. This mechanism enables S4M to learn globally coherent separation and reconstruction. The experimental results show that S4M performs comparably to other separation backbones in terms of SI-SDRi, while having a much lower model complexity with significantly fewer trainable parameters. In addition, our S4M-tiny model (1.8M parameters) even surpasses attention-based Sepformer (26.0M parameters) in noisy conditions with only 9.2 of multiply-accumulate operation (MACs).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Residual Shuffle-Exchange Networks for Fast Processing of Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*K\u0101rlis Freivalds, Mat\u012bss Apinis, Agris \u0160ostaks, Em\u012bls Ozoli\u0146\u0161, Andis Draguns*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a commonly used mechanism in sequence processing, but it is of O(n^2) complexity which prevents its application to long sequences. The recently introduced neural Shuffle-Exchange network offers a computation-efficient alternative, enabling the modelling of long-range dependencies in O(n log n) time. The model, however, is quite complex, involving a sophisticated gating mechanism derived from the Gated Recurrent Unit. In this paper, we present a simple and lightweight variant of the Shuffle-Exchange network, which is based on a residual network employing GELU and Layer Normalization. The proposed architecture not only scales to longer sequences but also converges faster and provides better accuracy. It surpasses the Shuffle-Exchange network on the LAMBADA language modelling task and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MusicNet dataset for music transcription while being efficient in the number of parameters. We show how to combine the improved Shuffle-Exchange network with convolutional layers, establishing it as a useful building block in long sequence processing applications.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-06\n\n\n\n#### 6. Task-Specific Normalization for Continual Learning of Blind Image Quality Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"lightweight gating mechanisms in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Xiaokang Yang, Guangtao Zhai, Kede Ma, Weixia Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for blind image quality assessment (BIQA) with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off, and task-order/-length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze all convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an explicit promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters for plasticity. We assign each new IQA dataset (i.e., task) a prediction head, and load the corresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final quality estimate is computed by black a weighted summation of predictions from all heads with a lightweight $K$-means gating mechanism. Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques for BIQA.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-28\n\n\n\n#### 7. Crop Classification under Varying Cloud Cover with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*Konrad Schindler, Jan Dirk Wegner, Stefano D'Aronco, Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu, Nando Metzger*\n\n**Abstract:** Optical satellite sensors cannot see the Earth's surface through clouds. Despite the periodic revisit cycle, image sequences acquired by Earth observation satellites are therefore irregularly sampled in time. State-of-the-art methods for crop classification (and other time series analysis tasks) rely on techniques that implicitly assume regular temporal spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state; and a prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-04\n\n\n\n#### 8. On Robustness of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"neural ODEs convolutional neural networks integration\"*\n\n*Hanshu Yan, Jiawei Du, Jiashi Feng, Vincent Y. F. Tan*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) have been attracting increasing attention in various research domains recently. There have been some works studying optimization issues and approximation capabilities of neural ODEs, but their robustness is still yet unclear. In this work, we fill this important gap by exploring robustness properties of neural ODEs both empirically and theoretically. We first present an empirical study on the robustness of the neural ODE-based networks (ODENets) by exposing them to inputs with various types of perturbations and subsequently investigating the changes of the corresponding outputs. In contrast to conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we find that the ODENets are more robust against both random Gaussian perturbations and adversarial attack examples. We then provide an insightful understanding of this phenomenon by exploiting a certain desirable property of the flow of a continuous-time ODE, namely that integral curves are non-intersecting. Our work suggests that, due to their intrinsic robustness, it is promising to use neural ODEs as a basic block for building robust deep network models. To further enhance the robustness of vanilla neural ODEs, we propose the time-invariant steady neural ODE (TisODE), which regularizes the flow on perturbed data via the time-invariant property and the imposition of a steady-state constraint. We show that the TisODE method outperforms vanilla neural ODEs and also can work in conjunction with other state-of-the-art architectural methods to build more robust deep networks.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive Language Model (LM) block by enhancing the existing Convolutional Generalized Autoregressive Unit (Conv GAU) with Mixture of Experts (MoE), Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), and Efficient Gating Mechanisms, here are the key insights and useful information from the provided references and analysis:\n\n### Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n\n- **Specialization and Scalability**: Incorporating MoE into Conv GAUs can allow for multiple specialized experts to handle different input patterns, enhancing model capacity without a proportional increase in computational resources.

The reviewed references provide valuable insights into advanced routing strategies, seamless integration techniques, and efficient gating designs that can be adapted and extended to Conv GAUs. \n\nHowever, to ensure the proposal's uniqueness and effectiveness, further exploration is essential. Specifically, identifying and designing unique integration strategies that differentiate the proposed Conv GAU from existing models like **Hyena**, **ConvSSM**, **Mamba**, and **DenseMamba** is crucial.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.57)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Spanring, Andreas Auer, Oleksandra Prudnikova, Michael K Kopp, G. Klambauer, Johannes Brandstetter, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n**Abstract:** In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced as the central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/97 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nSee Figure 9 and Figure 10 in the appendix for details. space; see left panel of Figure 3 and third column in Figure 1. A more detailed version is depicted in Figure 9 in the appendix. (ii) A residual block with pre up-projection (like State Space Models), which linearly maps to a high-dimensional space, non-linearly summarizes the past in the high-dimensional space and then linearly maps back to the original space. For an xLSTM block containing an sLSTM, we mostly use the post up-projection block. For an xLSTM block containing an mLSTM , we use the pre up-projection block since the memory capacity becomes larger in the high-dimensional space. See left panel of Figure 3 and third column in Figure 1, or Figure 9 in the appendix for more details. xLSTM Architecture. An xLSTM architecture is constructed by residually stacking building blocks (Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). We rely on the most commonly used preLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016b) residual backbones as used in contemporary Large Language Models. See last column in Figure 1. ### 2.5 Memory and Speed Considerations\n\nContrary to Transformers, xLSTM networks have a linear computation and a constant memory complexity with respect to the sequence length. Since the xLSTM memory is compressive, it is well suited for industrial applications and implementations on the edge. The memory of mLSTM does not require parameters but is computationally expensive through its $d \\times d$ matrix memory and $d \\times d$ update. We trade off memory capacity against computational complexity. Nevertheless, the computations can be done in parallel on GPUs, therefore these computations have only a minor effect on the wall clock time. While mLSTM is parallelizable analog to FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2024) or GLA (Yang et al., 2023), sLSTM is not parallelizable due to the memory mixing (hidden-hidden connections). However, we developed a fast CUDA implementation with GPU memory optimizations to the register level which is typically less than two times slower than mLSTM. ## 3 Related Work\n\nLinear Attention. Several methods have been suggested to overcome the quadratic complexity in terms of context length of the Transformer and make attention linear in the context length. The Synthesizer learns synthetic attention weights without token-token interactions (Tay et al., 2020). Linformer realizes self-attention by a low-rank matrix and even linearly approximates it (Wang et al., 2020). Linear Transformer linearizes the attention mechanism (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Performer linearly approximates the attention softmax by positive orthogonal random features approach (Choromanski et al., 2021). Attention has been replaced by fast long convolutions in the Structured Global Convolution (SGConv) (Li et al., 2022) and the Hyena Hierarchy (Poli et al., 2023). State Space Models. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs) became very popular since they are linear in the context length and show promising performance compared to Transformers. One of the first proposed models was Structured State Space sequence model (S4) (Gu et al., 2021), followed by Diagonal State Space (DSS) model (Gupta et al., 2022), Gated State Space (GSS) models (Mehta et al., 2022), S5 model (Smith et al., 2022), Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS) (Wang et al., 2022), H3 model (Fu et al., 2023), and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Recurrent Neural Networks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been suggested to replace Transformer and attention due to their linearity in the context length. RNNs with Deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs) showed promising results for language modeling (Orvieto et al., 2023; De et al., 2024), as did Hierarchically Gated Linear RNN (HGRN) (Qin et al., 2023) and HGRN2 (Qin et al., 2024). A well-known RNN approach to large language modeling is RWKV (Peng et al., 2023, 2024), showcasing competitive performance to Transformers. Gating. One of the key ideas of LSTM is gating, which was rediscovered and reinterpreted in many recent approaches. Gating was used in HGRN (Qin et al., 2023), HGRN2 (Qin et al., 2024), Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al., 2023), Gated State Space (GSS) models (Mehta et al., 2022), Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS) (Wang et al., 2022), Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention (MEGA) (Ma et al., 2022), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Covariance Update Rule. To enhance storage capacities, we equipped the mLSTM cell with a matrix memory with a covariance update rule. Other methods which build on such an update mechanism are Fast Weight Programmers (Schmidhuber, 1992; Schlag et al., 2021), RWKV-5 and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), Retention (Sun et al., 2023), Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), and HGRN2 (Qin et al., 2024). Most Related. Conceptually the closest models to xLSTM are Retention (Sun et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023, 2024), and HGRN2 (Qin et al., 2024). These models share the concepts matrix memory and/or gating. However, in contrast to the new sLSTM, these approaches do not allow memory mixing. Memory mixing enables to solve state tracking problems, and therefore LSTMs are more expressive than State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers (Merrill et al., 2024; Del\u00e9tang et al., 2023). State tracking is required to evaluate code or to track entities in a long narrative. Residually Stacking Architectures. Like almost all contemporary large deep learning models, xLSTM architectures are constructed by residually stacking building blocks (Srivastava et al., 2015; He et al., 2016). This construction enabled deep convolutional networks (He et al., 2016) and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Transformers are the ultimate force behind Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ChatGPT (Schulman et al., 2022), GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023), Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019), Gopher (Rae et al., 2021), ERNIE 3.0 Titan (Wang et al., 2021), GLaM (Du et al., 2021), Chinese M6 (Lin et al., 2021), mutilingual AlexaTM 20B (Soltan et al., 2022), OPT (Zhang et al., 2022), Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), GLM-130B (Zeng et al., 2022), LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), Gemini (Google, 2023; Reid et al., 2024). ## 4 Experiments\n\nIn this section, we experimentally evaluate xLSTM and compare it to existing methods with a focus on language modeling. We investigate xLSTM's specific capabilities on synthetic tasks in Section 4.1. In Section 4.2, we compare the validation set perplexity of various current language modeling methods that were trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023). On the same dataset, we perform ablation studies for xLSTM. Then, we assess the scaling behavior of the different methods analogous to Kaplan et al. (2020) and Brown et al. (2020). In Section 4.3, we conduct a more thorough language modeling experiment. We compare xLSTM and the best performing methods from Section 4.2 after being trained on 300B tokens from SlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023). First, we assess how well the methods perform in extrapolating to longer contexts, secondly we test the methods via validation perplexity and performance on downstream tasks (Sutawika et al., 2024), thirdly we evaluate the methods on 571 text domains of the PALOMA language benchmark dataset (Magnusson et al., 2023), fourthly we again assess the scaling behavior of the different methods, but now with 20 times more training data. For all experiments, we use the notation $\\operatorname{xLSTM}[a: b]$ for the ratio $a / b$ of mLSTM-based versus sLSTM-based xLSTM blocks. For example, xLSTM[7:1] means that out of eight blocks, seven are mLSTM-based blocks and one is an sLSTM-based block. For a common total block number of 48, this translates to 6 sLSTM-based blocks and 42 mLSTM -based blocks. Further, for all experiments, we use pre and post up-projection blocks for mLSTM and sLSTM, respectively. ### 4.1 Synthetic Tasks and Long Range Arena\n\nFirst, we test the effectiveness of xLSTM's new exponential gating with memory mixing on formal languages (Del\u00e9tang et al., 2023). Then, we assess the effectiveness of xLSTM's new matrix memory on the Multi-Query Associative Recall task (Arora et al., 2023). Finally, xLSTM's performance at processing long sequences in the Long Range Arena is evaluated (Tay et al., 2021). Test of xLSTM's Exponential Gating with Memory Mixing. We test xLSTM's new exponential gating with memory mixing, which should enable it to solve state tracking problems (Merrill et al., 2024; Merrill \\& Sabharwal, 2023). We implement and extend the formal language tasks from Del\u00e9tang et al. (2023) to enable multi-length training for length extrapolation. For a detailed description of all tasks and extended results see Appendix B.1.1. We compare xLSTM to other methods including Transformers, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks. The accuracy of the tested methods is evaluated on those tokens relevant to the task. The accuracy is scaled between 0 (random) and 1 (perfect). We compare 2-block architectures of the following methods on these tasks: xLSTM[0:1] (i.e., only sLSTM), xLSTM[1:0] (i.e., only mLSTM), xLSTM[1:1], Llama, Mamba, RWKV, Retention, Hyena, LSTM, and LSTM in Transformer blocks (LSTM (Block)). The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4. Models such as Transformers or State Space Models without memory mixing (no state tracking) cannot solve e.g. regular grammars like the parity task. |  | Context Sentsitive |  | Deterministic <br> Context Free |  | Regular |  |  |  | Majority | Majority <br> Count |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n|  | Bucket Sort | Missing <br> Duplicate | Mod <br> Arithmetic <br> (w Brackets) | Solve <br> Equation | Cycle Nav | Even Pairs | Mod <br> Arithmetic <br> (w/o Brackets) | Parity |  |  |\n| Llama- | 0.92 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.08 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.02 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.02 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.37 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.13 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ |\n| Mamba - | 0.69 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.15 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.05 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.86 | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.05 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.13 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.69 | 0.45 <br> $\\pm 0.03$ |\n| Retention - | 0.13 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.05 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.51 <br> $\\pm 0.07$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.05 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.36 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.12 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ |\n| Hyena - | 0.3 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.06 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.05 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.02 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.06 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.93 | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.36 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.18 <br> +0.02 |\n| RWKV-4- | 0.54 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.21 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.06 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.07 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.13 | 1.0 | 0.07 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.06 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.63 | 0.13 |\n| RWKV-5- | 0.49 <br> $\\pm 0.04$ | 0.15 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.08 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.08 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.26 <br> $\\pm 0.05$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.15 | 0.06 <br> $\\pm 0.03$ | 0.73 | 0.34 <br> $\\pm 0.03$ |\n| RWKV-6- | 0.96 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.23 <br> $\\pm 0.06$ | 0.09 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.09 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.31 <br> $\\pm 0.14$ | 1.0 | 0.16 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.22 <br> $\\pm 0.12$ | 0.76 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.24 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ |\n| LSTM <br> (Block) | 0.99 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.15 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.76 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.5 <br> $\\pm 0.05$ | 0.97 <br> $\\pm 0.03$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.91 <br> $\\pm 0.09$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.58 <br> $\\pm 0.02$ | 0.27 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ |\n| LSTM - | 0.94 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.2 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.72 <br> $\\pm 0.04$ | 0.38 <br> $\\pm 0.05$ | 0.93 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 0.82 | 0.33 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ |\n| xLSTM[0:1] - | 0.84 | 0.23 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.57 <br> $\\pm 0.09$ | 0.55 <br> $\\pm 0.09$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.75 | 0.22 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ |\n| xLSTM[1:0] - | 0.97 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.33 <br> $\\pm 0.22$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.03 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.86 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 1.0 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ | 0.04 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.74 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.46 <br> $\\pm 0.0$ |\n| xLSTM[1:1] - | 0.7 <br> $\\pm 0.21$ | 0.2 <br> $\\pm 0.01$ | 0.15 <br> $\\pm 0.06$ | 0.24 | 0.8 <br> $\\pm 0.03$ | 1.0 | 0.6 | 1.0 | 0.64 | 0.5 |\n\nFigure 4: Test of xLSTM's exponential gating with memory mixing. Results are given by the scaled accuracy of different models at solving formal language tasks, of which some require state tracking. The different tasks are grouped by the Chomsky hierarchy. This result is in agreement with findings that Transformers and State Space models are fundamentally less powerful than RNNs (Merrill et al., 2024; Merrill \\& Sabharwal, 2023; Del\u00e9tang et al., 2023). Test of xLSTM's Memory Capacities on Associative Recall Tasks. In this experiment, we test xLSTM's new matrix memory in terms of the memory capacity on the Multi-Query Associative Recall task (Arora et al., 2023): For each sequence, key-value pairs are randomly chosen from a large vocabulary, which must be memorized for later retrieval. To enhance the difficulty of the original task, we increase the number of key-value pairs up to 256 and extend the context length up to 2048. Thus, we have broader tests for the memory capacities of different models. We compare 2-block architectures of Llama, Mamba, RWKV-5, RWKV-6, xLSTM[1:1] and xLSTM[1:0]. The models are evaluated by the accuracy at recalling the pairs. Since Transformers (e.g. Llama) have a memory that is exponential in the coding dimension (Ramsauer et al., 2021), they constitute the gold standard at this task. Results are shown in Figure 5. xLSTM[1:1] performs best among all non-Transformer models, also for small models. Interestingly, the sLSTM block does not diminish the memory capacity but rather leverages it, which becomes evident at the most difficult task with 256 key-value pairs. Additional results are presented in Appendix B.1.2, where extrapolation analyses indicate that xLSTM's enhanced memory capacities also pertain when extrapolating to contexts that are longer than those seen during training. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3c3a019434ab6232601dg-08.jpg?height=413&width=1387&top_left_y=1948&top_left_x=369)\n\nFigure 5: Test of memory capacities of different models at the Multi-Query Associative Recall task with context length 2048. Each panel is dedicated to a different number of key-value pairs. The $x$-axis displays the model size and the $y$-axis the validation accuracy. Test of xLSTM's Long Context Capabilities on Long Range Arena. To assess xLSTM's performance on long sequences and large contexts, we compare different methods on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021). xLSTM demonstrates consistent strong performance on all of the tasks, suggesting that the xLSTM architecture is remarkably efficient in handling different aspects of long context problems. For more details, see Appendix B.1.3. # 4.2 Method Comparison and Ablation Study \n\nThe main question of this paper is, what can we achieve in language modeling when scaling up the new LSTM variants. Therefore, we train xLSTMs, Transformers, State Space Models, and other methods on 15B tokens from SlimPajama in an auto-regressive language modeling setting. We compare the trained models on the validation set. Finally, we perform ablation studies for xLSTM. Comparing xLSTM to Other Methods. For comparison, we train models on 15B tokens from SlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023). The trained models are evaluated by their perplexity on the validation set. We compare the following methods: xLSTM (our new method), GPT-3 (Transformer) (Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Transformer) (Touvron et al., 2023), H3 (SSM) (Fu et al., 2023), Mamba (SSM) (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), RWKV-4 (RNN) (Peng et al., 2023), RWKV-5 (RNN) (Peng et al., 2024), RWKV-6 (RNN) (Peng et al., 2024), GLA (linear Transformer) (Yang et al., 2023), HGRN (RNN) (Qin et al., 2023), HGRN2 (RNN) (Qin et al., 2024). RetNet (linear Transformer) (Sun et al., 2023), Hyena (linear Transformer) (Poli et al., 2023), xLSTM[1:0], and xLSTM[7:1] (see Section 4). The models were trained with mixed precision, except RWKV-5, RWKV-6, GLA, HGRN, HGRN2, where mixed-precision training was not supported by the reference implementation. We categorize the methods into (a) Transformers, (b) State Space Models (SSMs), and (c) Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) together with linear Transformers. Linear Transformers are linear methods that substitute the Transformer attention mechanism. The models match a GPT-3 model with 350 M parameters in size, i.e. embedding dim 1024 and 24 residual blocks. Only GPT-3 uses shared weights for token and output embeddings, therefore has fewer parameters. The results in Table 1 show that xLSTM outperforms all existing methods in validation perplexity. For details see Appendix B.2. Figure 6 shows the scaling behaviour for this experiment, indicating that xLSTM will also\n\n| Model | \\#Params <br> M | SlimPajama <br> (15B) $\\mathrm{ppl} \\downarrow$ |\n| :--- | :---: | ---: |\n| GPT-3 | 356 | 14.26 |\n| Llama | 407 | $\\underline{14.25}$ |\n| H3 | 420 | 18.23 |\n| Mamba | 423 | $\\underline{13.70}$ |\n| Hyena | 435 | 17.59 |\n| RWKV-4 | 430 | $\\underline{15.62}$ |\n| RWKV-5 | 456 | 16.53 |\n| RWKV-6 | 442 | 17.40 |\n| RetNet | 431 | 16.23 |\n| HGRN | 411 | 21.83 |\n| GLA | 412 | 19.56 |\n| HGRN2 | 411 | 16.77 |\n| xLSTM[1:0] | 409 | $\\underline{\\mathbf{1 3 . 4 3}}$ |\n| xLSTM[7:1] | 408 | 13.48 |\n\nTable 1: Method comparison on next token prediction when trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama.

Table 1 and Figure 6 demonstrate that xLSTM achieves excellent results at language modeling when being trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama. Thus, it is only natural to ask which of the elements of xLSTM is responsible for the improvements over vanilla LSTM performances, evoking an ablation study of the individual new xLSTM components. For doing so, we morph a vanilla LSTM architecture step-by-step into an xLSTM architecture. First, we integrate LSTM layers into pre-LayerNorm residual backbones, second we extend this to a post up-projection block, then we add exponential gating, and finally the matrix memory. The results are shown in Table 2 (top). The ablation studies attribute the strong performance improvement to both the exponential gating and the matrix memory. Additionally, since gating is an ever-occuring topic in RNNs and State Space Models, we ablate different gating mechanisms. In Table 2 (bottom), we conclude that having each gate learnable and influenced by the input has an incremental positive effect. Additional studies on the individual backbone components are discussed in Appendix B.2. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3c3a019434ab6232601dg-10.jpg?height=541&width=882&top_left_y=369&top_left_x=378)\n\nFigure 6: Method comparison on next token prediction when trained on 15B tokens from SlimPajama. Performance measure in validation perplexity for the best methods of each model class (see Table 1) are reported. The performance degradation of $\\mathrm{xLSTM}[7: 1]$ at 2.7 B is due to initially slower training convergence that leads to an especially undertrained model. xLSTM is the best method at all sizes.

Top: Ablation studies on the new xLSTM components, contributing the strong performance improvement of xLSTM over vanilla LSTM to both the exponential gating and the matrix memory. Bottom: Ablation studies on different gating techniques. We consider an xLSTM[1:0] with sigmoid forget gate and exponential input gate. Bias initialization $\\infty$ means that the forget gate is set to one, $[3,6]$ indicates that values are taken equidistant in the respective interval, and $\\mathcal{N}(0,0.1)$ that values are randomly chosen from a Gaussian with mean 0 and std 0.1 . PPL denotes validation perplexity. The first two lines correspond to models similar to linearized attention, line four to Retention, line five to RWKV-5, and line six to RWKV-6. Dependencies of the gates on the input lead to better performance. ## 4.3 xLSTM as Large Language Model\n\nWe culminate this study in large-scale language modeling experiments, testing the potential of xLSTM as an LLM. We therefore increase the amount of training data and train on 300B tokens from SlimPajama. The same number of tokens is used in e.g., Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) and Griffin (De et al., 2024). We compare xLSTM, RWKV-4, Llama, and Mamba, which were selected as the best-performing methods in their respective method classes in the model comparison in Section 4.2. We train different model sizes ( $125 \\mathrm{M}, 350 \\mathrm{M}, 760 \\mathrm{M}, 1.3 \\mathrm{~B}$ ), test all models for length extrapolation capabilities and evaluate their performance on the validation set. We assess their performance on downstream tasks, test their performance in language modeling on 471 text domains of the PALOMA benchmark, and, finally, investigate their scaling law behavior. Sequence Length Extrapolation. First, we test the sequence length extrapolation for 1.3B-sized, large models of xLSTM, RWKV-4, Llama, and Mamba. All models are trained on context length 2048, and then tested for context lengths up to 16384. See Figure 7 for the results. In contrast to other methods, xLSTM models maintain low perplexities for longer contexts. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3c3a019434ab6232601dg-11.jpg?height=592&width=1391&top_left_y=886&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 7: Sequence extrapolation in language modeling. This is a comparison of 1.3B-sized, large models of xLSTM, RWKV-4, Llama, and Mamba at next token prediction on the SlimPajama validation set after training on 300B tokens from SlimPajama. Models are trained with context length 2048 and then tested for context lengths up to 16384. Left: Token perplexities evaluated at different context lengths. In contrast to other methods, xLSTM models remain at low perplexities for longer contexts. Right: Prediction quality when extrapolating to long context sizes in terms of validation perplexity (PPL). xLSTM yields the best PPL values (best in bold, second best underlined). Validation Perplexity and Downstream Tasks. Secondly, for all model sizes, we evaluate the performance of xLSTM, RWKV-4, Llama, and Mamba models on the SlimPajama validation set for next token prediction and on downstream tasks that measure common sense reasoning. The third column of Table 3 lists the validation set perplexities of different methods. Both xLSTM[1:0] and $\\mathrm{xLSTM}[7: 1]$ are the best models for all model sizes with respect to the validation set perplexity. The other columns of Table 3 provide the performance on downstream tasks. In the vast majority of tasks and across all model sizes xLSTM is the best method - only on the ARC task Mamba is in some cases the best method. For details see Appendix B.3. Performance on PALOMA Language Tasks. Thirdly, for all model sizes, we test the next token prediction performance of xLSTM, RWKV-4, Llama, and Mamba models on PALOMA language tasks (Magnusson et al., 2023). We measure the performance by the perplexity for next token prediction on 571 text domains, which range from nytimes.com to r/depression on Reddit. Table 4 shows token prediction perplexity grouped into language modeling (first seven columns) and finegrained domain benchmarks (last 5 columns). xLSTM[1:0] performs better than xLSTM[7:1] on these language tasks. xLSTM[1:0] has in 568 out of 571 (99.5\\%) text domains a lower perplexity than Mamba, in 486 out of 571 (85.1\\%) a lower perplexity than Llama, in 570 out of 571 (99.8\\%) a lower perplexity than RWKV-4.

Fourthly, we assess the power-law scaling behavior, which allows to extrapolate the performance to larger model sizes (Kaplan et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020). Figure 8 presents the scaling behavior. All models share a similar scaling behavior but with different offsets. RWKV-4 performs worst, followed by Llama and Mamba. xLSTM is better than Mamba with a similar margin to Mamba as Mamba has to Llama. The scaling behavior indicates that for larger models xLSTM will continue to perform favourable compared to Transformers and State-Space models. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_3c3a019434ab6232601dg-13.jpg?height=809&width=1348&top_left_y=539&top_left_x=386)\n\nFigure 8: Scaling laws.

The scaling laws indicate that for larger models xLSTM will perform well, too. ## 5 Limitations\n\n(i) In contrast to mLSTM, memory mixing of the sLSTM prohibits parallelizable operations, and therefore does not allow a fast parallel implementation. Nevertheless, we developed a fast CUDA kernel for sLSTM, which is currently around 1.5 times slower than our parallel mLSTM implementation. (ii) The CUDA kernels for mLSTM are not optimized, and therefore the current implementation is about 4 times slower than FlashAttention or the scan used in Mamba. Faster CUDA kernels could be obtained in the vein of FlashAttention. (iii) The matrix memory of mLSTM has high computation complexity since $d \\times d$ matrices must be processed. Still, the memory update and retrieval does not use parameters and can be parallelized using standard matrix operations, therefore the wall clock time overhead due to the complex memory is minor. (iv) The initialization of the forget gates must be chosen carefully. (v) Since the matrix memory is independent of the sequence length, increasing the sequence length might overload the memory for longer context sizes. Still, this does not appear to be a limitation for contexts up to 16 k , see Section 4.3. (vi) Due to the expensive computational load for large language experiments, we did neither fully optimize the architecture nor the hyperparameters, especially for larger xLSTM architectures. We anticipate that an extensive optimization process is needed for xLSTM to reach its full potential. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have partly answered our simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTM to billions of parameters? So far, we can answer: \"At least as far as current technologies like Transformers or State Space Models\". We have enhanced LSTM to xLSTM by exponential gating with memory mixing and a new memory structure. xLSTM models perform favorably on language modeling when compared to state-of-the-art methods like Transformers and State Space Models. The scaling laws indicate that larger xLSTM models will be serious competitors to current Large Language Models that are built with the Transformer technology. xLSTM has the potential to considerably impact other deep learning fields like Reinforcement Learning, Time Series Prediction, or the modeling of physical systems. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Sebastian Lehner, Daniel Klotz, Thomas Adler, Matthias Dellago, Gerald Gutenbrunner, Fabian Paischer, Vihang Patil, Niklas Schmidinger, Benedikt Alkin, Kajetan Schweighofer, Anna Zimmel, Lukas Aichberger, Lukas Hauzenberger, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl, Johannes Lehner for helpful discussions and feedback. ## References\n\nJ.

Consequently, developing Deep Learning (DL) sequence models capable of effectively managing long contexts is a critical objective. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), despite their current dominance in general DL tasks, still face challenges in processing long sequences. Specifically, their quadratic complexity in sequence length makes them computationally\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_e89110ee242b61a620bfg-01.jpg?height=453&width=780&top_left_y=753&top_left_x=1049)\n\nFigure 1: Document Retrieval Over SQuAD. We present a novel decimation mechanism tailored for Mamba, enabling it to process sequences that are x 25 times longer than the ones seen during training. The purple line shows the training sequences length. Results are shown for DeciMamba-130M. demanding, restricting the ability to train them over long sequences and very large datasets. In recent years, substantial efforts have been made in order to tackle this challenge. The most significant advancements include efficient implementations that increase the model's context length during training (Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023), and context-extension methods (Chen et al., 2023b; Peng et al., 2023b) designed to effectively expand the context after training. However, recent studies suggest that long-range processing is still an unresolved problem (Li et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024a). One promising approach in this domain is the development of attention-free networks with subquadratic complexity, which can be trained more effectively over long sequences. In a recent line of work (Gu et al., 2021b,a; Gupta et al., 2022), the family of state-space layers has been introduced. These layers can be seen as theoretically grounded linear RNNs that can be efficiently computed in parallel via convolutions, thanks to a closed-form formulation of their linear recurrent rule. A recent advancement by Gu and Dao (2023) presented Mamba, which builds on top of an expressive variant of SSMs called Selective State-Space Layers\n(S6). These layers match or exceed the performance of Transformers in several domains, such as NLP (Pi\u00f3ro et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024), image classification (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024b), audio processing (Shams et al., 2024), genomic data (Schiff et al., 2024), and more. In this paper, we first explore the lengthgeneralization abilities of Mamba and identify that they are relatively limited. Although Mamba layers are theoretically capable of capturing global interactions at the layer level, through a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures, we show that the main barrier preventing Mamba from extrapolating is its implicit bias towards a limited effective receptive field (ERF), which is bounded primarily by the sequence length used during training. Secondly, based on the assumption that long-context data is usually sparse, we present DeciMamba, the first context-extension method specifically designed for S6. Our method relies on a dynamic data-dependent pooling method that utilizes a hidden filtering mechanism intrinsic to the Mamba layer. We leverage this mechanism to introduce a global compression operator, which expands Mamba's ERF by discarding un-important tokens before each S6 layer. Our method significantly increases the effective context length of Mamba by several orders of magnitude while requiring a smaller computational budget. Our main contributions encompass the following three aspects: (i) identify that Mamba has limited length-extrapolation capabilities, (ii) recognize via a series of visualizations, analyses, and empirical measures that although Mamba can theoretically capture global interactions via the recurrent state, its limited ERF prevents significant lengthextrapolation. (iii) Building on this insight, we introduce DeciMamba, the first context-extension technique specifically designed for Mamba models. This approach leverages an existing filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer. As illustrated in Fig. 8, our method effectively enhances Mamba's length-extrapolation abilities by up to eightfold, and is applicable to real-world long-context NLP tasks, as demonstrated in Fig. 1. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, the scientific context for discussion of long-range models is described and the necessary terminology and symbols are provided. Such models evolve in two main directions: (i) first, by adapting transformers, the most dominant architec- ture today, to be more suitable for such tasks, or, alternatively, (ii) by developing architectures with sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length. Several modern examples include Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023a), Hawk (De et al., 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al., 2024), and Mamba, the latter being the focus of our paper. Mamba. Given an input sequence $U=$ $\\left(u_{1}, u_{2}, \\ldots, u_{L}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ of length $L$ such that $u_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, a Mamba block with $d$ channels is built on top of the S6 layer via the following formula:\n$G=\\sigma(\\operatorname{Linear}(U)), \\quad X=\\operatorname{Conv1D}(\\operatorname{Linear}(U))$,\n\n$$\nY=S 6(X), \\quad O=Y \\otimes G\n$$\n\nwhere $G$ represents the gate branch, $\\otimes$ is elementwise multiplication, $\\sigma$ is the SILU activation, Linear and Conv1D are standard linear projection and 1-dimensional convolution layers. The S6 layer is based on a time-variant SSM, which can be elaborated by the following recurrent rule:\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\bar{A}_{t} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B}_{t} x_{t}, \\quad y_{t}=C_{t} h_{t}\n$$\n\nWhere $X=\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{L}\\right)$ is the input sequence of a representative channel, $\\bar{A}_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\bar{B}_{t} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$, and $C_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ are the system, input, and output discrete time-variant matrices, respectively. S6 conditions the discrete time-variant matrices based on the input as follows:\n$\\Delta_{t}=\\operatorname{Sft}\\left(S_{\\Delta} X_{t}\\right), \\quad B_{t}=S_{B} X_{t}, \\quad C_{t}=\\left(S_{C} X_{t}\\right)^{T}$\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{t}=\\exp \\left(A \\Delta_{t}\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}_{t}=B_{t} \\Delta_{t}\n$$\n\nsuch that $\\Delta_{t}$ is the discretization step, Sft represents the softplus function, and $S_{\\Delta}, S_{B}, S_{C}$ are linear projection layers. Ali et al. (2024) demonstrated that S6 layers, similar to attention models, can be interpreted as data-controlled linear operators. Specifically, the S6 layer computation can be represented using the following linear operator $\\alpha$, controlled by the input (via Eq. 4 and 5):\n\n$$\nY=\\alpha X, \\quad \\alpha_{i, j}=C_{i}\\left(\\prod_{k=j+1}^{i} \\bar{A}_{k}\\right) \\bar{B}_{j}\n$$\n\n$\\left[\\begin{array}{c}y_{1} \\\\ y_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{L}\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}C_{1} \\bar{B}_{1} & 0 & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ C_{2} \\bar{A}_{2} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{2} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & 0 \\\\ C_{L} \\Pi_{k=2}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{1} & C_{L} \\Pi_{k=3}^{L} \\bar{A}_{k} \\bar{B}_{2} & \\cdots & C_{L} \\bar{B}_{L}\\end{array}\\right] \\underset{(7)}{\\left[\\begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{L}\\end{array}\\right]}$\nIn this formulation, each output $y_{i}$ is a weighted sum of all inputs, where the 'attention weights' of all inputs $x_{j}$, i.e., the set $\\left\\{\\alpha_{i, j}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{L}$, is data-driven. We utilize this perspective to further investigate the effective receptive field of Mamba layers. ## Context Extension \\& Length Extrapolation. Over the years, several methods have been proposed to enhance the effective context length of transformers and improve their ability to extrapolate over longer sequences. Traditionally, length generalization is closely related to positional encoding. Pioneering work in the domain, introduced by Press et al. (2021), demonstrates that models built on top of original sinusoidal, rotary ( Su et al., 2024), and T5 bias (Raffel et al., 2020) positional encoding have poor length generalization abilities. It proposes Alibi, which mitigates this issue by promoting locality through the incorporation of distance-based linear biases into the attention matrix. A counter-intuitive study was conducted by Kazemnejad et al. (2024), which shows that transformers without positional encoding (NoPE) exhibit better length extrapolation capabilities in downstream tasks. Two more promising approaches are the very recent CoPE (Golovneva et al., 2024), which utilizes context-aware positional encoding, and post-training positional interpolation (Peng et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). Alternatively, a recent direction involves architectural modifications to pre-trained models followed by short fine-tuning. Such works include LongLora (Chen et al., 2023b), which proposes shifted sparse attention, and Landmark Attention (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023), which applies attention in chunks and inserts global unique tokens into the input sequences between those chunks. Our method can be considered an application of this approach to Mamba models, rather than to traditional transformers.\n```\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention via Control Variates (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2023)\t**Cited by** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 52/52 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\n2021). ## E. 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS OF EFFICIENCY COMPARISON\n\nFor the simulation experiment conducted in $\\S 5.3$ we adopt the same transformer architecture across all attention variants.

Besides, in our ablation study, the efficiency metrics reported in Table 6 and Table 7 are evaluated under the same setup used during training. Remark on Modeling Short Sequences. Unfortunately, similar to most previous efficient attention baselines, EVA also runs slower than softmax attention under shorter sequences (e.g., length of 128 or 256), but it soon catches up in running speed, and the reduction of memory consumption is still significant. Besides, in short-sequence settings (such as the case of DeiT-Tiny/Small with sequences of 196 tokens), EVA often performs on par with or better than conventional softmax attention (see Table 1, whereas most previous attention variants usually perform much worse. This implies EVA can achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and quality: for short sequences, EVA is possible to achieve stronger performance competitive with softmax attention (despite in longer running time); while for long sequences, EVA can be run much faster with less memory. Comparison to Memory-efficient Attention Mechanisms. In this section, we conduct an empirical efficiency comparison between efficient approximate attention methods and FlashAttention, one of the memory-efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe \\& Staats, 2021, Dao et al., 2022) with optimized memory accesses. FlashAttention computes the exact softmax attention in an online manner without materializing the full attention matrix, achieving linear memory complexity with respect to sequence lengths; besides, both runtime and memory usage are further improved by minimizing IO accesses. We benchmark different attention modules on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, where we measure the memory usage and runtime of running a single attention block, consisting of 8 attention heads with 512 embedding dimension size, for both a forward and backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that FlashAttention achieves significant memory usage reduction for softmax attention approximation and even consumes much less memory than all considered approximate baselines under all sequence lengths. In terms of runtime, we notice that FlashAttention runs faster than most attention baselines under sequence lengths less than 2048 despite scaling quadratically, but EVA, along with other more efficient approximate variants, begin to catch up at longer sequence lengths. This implies that the quadratic computational costs of softmax attention still bottleneck its runtime performance, aligning with one of the main findings in Dao et al. (2022). According to this empirical study, we observe that FlashAttention offers a general and effective technique to speed up softmax attention; since many approximate variants (including EVA) exhibit a similar formulation to softmax attention (e.g., Equation 16), we expect they can also benefit from the optimized online softmax calculation technique and memory accesses of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). ## F EXPERIMENTS on Long RANGE ArEnA\n\nLong Range Arena (LRA; Tay et al. 2021) is a lightweight benchmark that assesses the ability of efficient attention methods to model long sequences in diverse domains. We follow the same hyper-parameter setup as Xiong et al. (2021b) to re-evaluate all attention baselines and report the\n\nTable 15: Classification accuracy (\\%) on LRA benchmark with different efficient attention mechanisms. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Avg. |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Softmax | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 6}$ | 64.91 | 80.70 | 40.61 | 68.29 | 58.63 |\n| Linformer | 38.21 | 53.91 | 77.66 | 39.40 | 66.44 | 55.12 |\n| Performer | 29.84 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 3 0}$ | 77.70 | 38.29 | 66.39 | 55.50 |\n| Reformer | 27.12 | 63.90 | 78.08 | 42.40 | 51.90 | 52.69 |\n| Scatterbrain | 38.21 | 64.04 | 77.83 | 42.51 | 60.62 | 56.64 |\n| Combiner | 38.26 | 63.98 | 81.47 | 42.80 | 55.94 | 56.49 |\n| LARA | 37.10 | 64.62 | 80.82 | 38.99 | 68.96 | 58.10 |\n| Nystr\u00f6mformer | 38.46 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 2 8}$ | 80.44 | 39.71 | 68.98 | 58.57 |\n| Local | 38.46 | 63.70 | 80.71 | 42.25 | 68.46 | 58.72 |\n| Long-short | 38.56 | 63.46 | $\\mathbf{8 1 . 7 3}$ | 40.54 | $\\mathbf{7 1 . 2 8}$ | 59.11 |\n| EVA | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 1}$ | 64.31 | 80.21 | $\\mathbf{4 3 . 2 4}$ | 70.90 | $\\mathbf{5 9 . 4 5}$ |\n\ncomparison in Table 15. We observe that EVA largely improves previous RFA methods such as Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), and performs competitively with full softmax attention. Notably, EVA even achieves better average results over all tasks, with higher accuracy on Image and Pathfinder benchmarks, suggesting its capability of capturing long-term dependencies. For LRA benchmark, we set all attention-specific hyper-parameters to 128 (e.g., the number of landmarks in Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al. 2021b) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), the window size in local attention and Combiner (Ren et al., 2021), etc.). We set $|E|=128$ and $C=64$ by default for EVA without any further tuning and find this setup works well. ## G Connections to Other AtTEntion Mechanisms\n\n## G. 1 RFA, SoftmAx AtTEntion, And EVA\n\nAs mentioned in our main text, one of the main contributions of this work is to develop a more general framework that bridges RFA and conventional softmax attention. To see how EVA (Equation 13) achieves this goal formally, note that if either $|E|=M$ or $C=M$, EVA would be equivalent to standard softmax attention; while if we set $|E|=0$ and $C=1$, EVA would recover vanilla RFA. ## G. 2 CONNECTIONS TO LARA\n\nNotably, EVA and LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) are two efficient attention mechanisms that are both built upon the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) formulation of RFAs. LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) puts the main focus on the proposal distribution used in SNIS and tries to design importance sampling proposals that are closer to the true underlying distribution. The proposed usage of multiple proposals further improves the estimation quality of SNIS and achieves strong empirical performance while still keeping linear complexity. In contrast to LARA, in this work we do not focus on the design choice of proposals used in importance sampling but aim to generalize the SNIS formulation further via control variates. As demonstrated in \\$3.2 our theory clearly delineates how the gap between such SNIS estimation and softmax attention can be closed by manipulating control variates. Since LARA and RFA are both SNIS estimators (their main difference lies in the choice of proposal distributions), our generalization also applies to LARA. To summarize, compared with LARA, EVA is a more general framework and improves conventional RFA from an orthogonal perspective. ## G. 3 Connections to Clustered AtTEntion\n\nClustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) is an efficient attention mechanism that first clusters the set of queries into multiple groups, computes the mean centroid of each group, and then performs attention between query centroids and original key-value pairs. This framework is fast and effective and enjoys well-bounded approximation error. Clustered attention and EVA share some similarities in two aspects. First, both of them adopt the partitioning technique to reduce the computational complexity while remaining effective; and secondly, both observe that the efficient attention mechanism can be improved by refining the approximation over specific elements. For instance, clustered attention can be improved (Vyas et al., 2020) by selecting top- $k$ key-value pairs that are most relevant to each centroid and then refining the approximation by recomputing attention weights over these keys using original queries; while EVA notices that we can directly employ the optimal control variate coefficient for a subset of key-value pairs $(m \\in E)$ while still remaining efficient, which yields a more accurate approximation. Nevertheless, our main technical contribution is to develop a control variate formulation in the context of RFA and demonstrate that how RFA can be further improved locally. On the other hand, while clustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) clusters queries, EVA partitions key-value pairs. This property makes EVA more amenable to the case of autoregressive language modeling since we do not impose clustering structures over the query set, and thus the causal relation among queries can be well maintained. ## G. 4 CONNECTIONS TO COMBINER\n\nCombiner (Ren et al. 2021) is a recently proposed attention mechanism that also partitions the sequence into chunks combined with local attention. The key difference between EVA and Combiner is the motivation, where Combiner introduces a structured factorization over the attention probability distribution, while our approach is built from the control variate perspective. ## G. 5 CONNECTIONS TO SCATTERbRAIN\n\nIn this section, we show that Scatterbrain (Chen et al., 2021a) can be cast as a special case of our framework EVA, although they are proposed based on quite different motivations. A Brief Review of Scatterbrain. Scatterbrain (Chen et al, 2021a) notes that sparse attention and RFA can approximate sharp and flat regions of the softmax attention matrix well, respectively. Based on this insight, Scatterbrain is proposed to first compute a Performer approximation to softmax attention and then cancel out the approximation error on critical regions via a sparse mechanism. Specifically, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) defines a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$ ) so that for each $(n, m) \\in \\mathbf{S}$ that indexes a non-zero entry. For notational simplicity, we also denote $\\operatorname{Supp}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{(i, j) \\mid S_{i j} \\neq 0\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{m \\mid S_{n m} \\neq 0\\right\\}$. With random features $\\phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ defined in Appendix A we let\n\n$$\nS_{n m}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then add it back to the approximate output:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{n}^{\\prime} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\mathbf{S V} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} S_{n m^{\\prime}} \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sparse mechanism can be thought of as modeling the error due to RFA and eliminating it on the support of $\\mathbf{S}$. After the correction step, Scatterbrain further adds a post-hoc normalization step to obtain a normalized attention output:\n\n$$\ny_{n}=\\frac{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}}{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) produces accurate approximation in the support of the sparse matrix and remains the random feature approximation outside the support. Scatterbrain is a Special Case of EVA. For notational convenience, we denote $E:=\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$. According to Proposition 1, suppose we employ optimal coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{m}$ for all entries in $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$, and use the same coefficient $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ for all the remaining entries (in other words, we let $C=1$ and the whole index set is only partitioned into two subsets $\\{E,[M] \\backslash E\\})$. Then we have\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5520e6e7b143a538a399g-35.jpg?height=138&width=1160&top_left_y=495&top_left_x=472)\n\nAnd the resulting estimator overall becomes\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\widetilde{g}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\sum_{m \\notin E} \\widetilde{g}_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\sum_{m \\notin E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}}{Z}+\\sum_{m \\notin E}\\left(g_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})-\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} h_{m}(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\right)+\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\left(1-\\sum_{m \\in E} \\frac{\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)}{Z}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nScatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) can be a special case of this estimation algorithm if we set the proposal distribution to $q(\\omega)=\\mathcal{N}(\\omega ;

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/56 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nThis suggests that the training sequence length should be carefully chosen according to the intended downstream use of the model. ### 6.2. Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy. For BERT, our model achieves parity with Transformers on pretraining perplexity and is better on some downstream NLP tasks. On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/21 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn CVPR, 2018.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 19 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"hierarchical convolutional attention\", \"gated state space networks\", \"dynamic convolutions language models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

A primary challenge in 3D object detection stems from the sparse distribution of points within the 3D scene. Existing high-performance methods typically employ 3D sparse convolutional neural networks with small kernels to extract features. To reduce computational costs, these methods resort to submanifold sparse convolutions, which prevent the information exchange among spatially disconnected features. Some recent approaches have attempted to address this problem by introducing large-kernel convolutions or self-attention mechanisms, but they either achieve limited accuracy improvements or incur excessive computational costs. We propose HEDNet, a hierarchical encoder-decoder network for 3D object detection, which leverages encoder-decoder blocks to capture long-range dependencies among features in the spatial space, particularly for large and distant objects. We conducted extensive experiments on the Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets. HEDNet achieved superior detection accuracy on both datasets than previous state-of-the-art methods with competitive efficiency.

Residual Non-local Attention Networks for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical convolutional attention\"*\n\n*Yulun Zhang, Kunpeng Li, Kai Li, Bineng Zhong, Y. Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network is generalized for various image restoration applications, such as image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a residual non-local attention network for high-quality image restoration. Without considering the uneven distribution of information in the corrupted images, previous methods are restricted by local convolutional operation and equal treatment of spatial- and channel-wise features. To address this issue, we design local and non-local attention blocks to extract features that capture the long-range dependencies between pixels and pay more attention to the challenging parts. Specifically, we design trunk branch and (non-)local mask branch in each (non-)local attention block. The trunk branch is used to extract hierarchical features. Local and non-local mask branches aim to adaptively rescale these hierarchical features with mixed attentions. The local mask branch concentrates on more local structures with convolutional operations, while non-local attention considers more about long-range dependencies in the whole feature map. Furthermore, we propose residual local and non-local attention learning to train the very deep network, which further enhance the representation ability of the network. Our proposed method can be generalized for various image restoration applications, such as image denoising, demosaicing, compression artifacts reduction, and super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that our method obtains comparable or better results compared with recently leading methods quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 636  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 4.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated state space networks\"*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity.

LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic convolutions language models\"*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In\nConvolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a\nfixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference\nand fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV\npairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion\ntechnique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss\nof contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token\nintegration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels\nthat dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for\nbroad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for\nstraightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural\nmodifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate\nthat LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various\ncontext lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both\ninference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed\nup to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable\nperformance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791\ncompared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we\nalso effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of\nfixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire\nsequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-08T01:35:11Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-25T21:09:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

It is able to select nodes that are significant for graph representation adaptively, and generate hierarchical features via aggregating the attention-weighted information in nodes. Additionally, we devise a hierarchical prediction architecture to sufficiently leverage the hierarchical representation and facilitate the model learning. The AttPool module together with the entire training structure can be integrated into existing GCNs, and is trained in an end-to-end fashion conveniently. The experimental results on several graph-classification benchmark datasets with various scales demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.\r\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2019-10\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Convolutional Hierarchical Attention Network for Query-Focused Video Summarization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical convolutional attention\"*\n\n*Zijian Zhang, Zhou Zhao, Shuwen Xiao, Min Yang, Xiaohui Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** Previous approaches for video summarization mainly concentrate on finding the most diverse and representative visual contents as video summary without considering the user's preference. This paper addresses the task of query-focused video summarization, which takes user's query and a long video as inputs and aims to generate a query-focused video summary. In this paper, we consider the task as a problem of computing similarity between video shots and query. To this end, we propose a method, named Convolutional Hierarchical Attention Network (CHAN), which consists of two parts: feature encoding network and query-relevance computing module. In the encoding network, we employ a convolutional network with local self-attention mechanism and query-aware global attention mechanism to learns visual information of each shot. The encoded features will be sent to query-relevance computing module to generate queryfocused video summary. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate the competitive performance and show the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated state space networks\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Liquid Time-constant Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"gated state space networks\"*\n\n*Alexander Amini, Radu Grosu, Daniela Rus, Ramin Hasani, Mathias Lechner*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new class of time-continuous recurrent neural network models. Instead of declaring a learning system's dynamics by implicit nonlinearities, we construct networks of linear first-order dynamical systems modulated via nonlinear interlinked gates. The resulting models represent dynamical systems with varying (i.e., liquid) time-constants coupled to their hidden state, with outputs being computed by numerical differential equation solvers. These neural networks exhibit stable and bounded behavior, yield superior expressivity within the family of neural ordinary differential equations, and give rise to improved performance on time-series prediction tasks. To demonstrate these properties, we first take a theoretical approach to find bounds over their dynamics and compute their expressive power by the trajectory length measure in latent trajectory space. We then conduct a series of time-series prediction experiments to manifest the approximation capability of Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs) compared to classical and modern RNNs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic convolutions language models\"*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 6. Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic convolutions language models\"*\n\n*Michael Auli, Angela Fan, Yann N. Dauphin, Felix Wu, Alexei Baevski*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention is a useful mechanism to build generative models for language\nand images. It determines the importance of context elements by comparing each\nelement to the current time step. In this paper, we show that a very\nlightweight convolution can perform competitively to the best reported\nself-attention results. Next, we introduce dynamic convolutions which are\nsimpler and more efficient than self-attention. We predict separate convolution\nkernels based solely on the current time-step in order to determine the\nimportance of context elements. The number of operations required by this\napproach scales linearly in the input length, whereas self-attention is\nquadratic. Experiments on large-scale machine translation, language modeling\nand abstractive summarization show that dynamic convolutions improve over\nstrong self-attention models. On the WMT'14 English-German test set dynamic\nconvolutions achieve a new state of the art of 29.7 BLEU.\n\n**Conference:** pay-less-attention-with-lightweight-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the analysis and the provided sources:\n\n## Novelty and Overlap with Existing Work\n\n- The proposal integrates **hierarchical convolutional attention**, **gated state space networks (SSNs)**, and **dynamic convolutional modules**.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. $\\left[\\mathrm{LKV}^{+}\\right.$18] Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Charles Windolf, and Thomas Serre.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Boosting Inference Efficiency: Unleashing the Power of Parameter-Shared Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs language models\"*\n\n*Weize Chen, Xiaoyue Xu, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs and proposes a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration.\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-shared pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as a successful approach in resource-constrained environments, enabling substantial reductions in model storage and memory costs without significant performance compromise. However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Knowledge Graph Representation Learning using Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs language models\"*\n\n*M. Nayyeri, Chengjin Xu, F. Hoffmann, Mirza Mohtashim Alam, Jens Lehmann, S. Vahdati*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neuro differential KGE that embeds nodes of a KG on the trajectories of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) as a vector field on several manifolds to enable structure preservation and consequently avoiding wrong inferences is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) have shown promising performance on link prediction tasks by mapping the entities and relations from a knowledge graph into a geometric space. The capability of KGEs in preserving graph characteristics including structural aspects and semantics, highly depends on the design of their score function, as well as the inherited abilities from the underlying geometry. Many KGEs use the Euclidean geometry which renders them incapable of preserving complex structures and consequently causes wrong inferences by the models. To address this problem, we propose a neuro differential KGE that embeds nodes of a KG on the trajectories of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). To this end, we represent each relation (edge) in a KG as a vector field on several manifolds. We specifically parameterize ODEs by a neural network to represent complex manifolds and complex vector fields on the manifolds. Therefore, the underlying embedding space is capable to assume the shape of various geometric forms to encode heterogeneous subgraphs. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets using state-of-the-art KGE models justify the ODE trajectories as a means to enable structure preservation and consequently avoiding wrong inferences.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Besacier*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to leverage data from both machine translation and natural language generation tasks and do transfer learning between MT, NLG, and MT with source-side metadata (MT+NLG), and outperforms the previous state of the art on the Rotowire NLG task.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, neural models led to significant improvements in both machine translation (MT) and natural language generation tasks (NLG). However, generation of long descriptive summaries conditioned on structured data remains an open challenge. Likewise, MT that goes beyond sentence-level context is still an open issue (e.g., document-level MT or MT with metadata). To address these challenges, we propose to leverage data from both tasks and do transfer learning between MT, NLG, and MT with source-side metadata (MT+NLG). First, we train document-based MT systems with large amounts of parallel data. Then, we adapt these models to pure NLG and MT+NLG tasks by fine-tuning with smaller amounts of domain-specific data. This end-to-end NLG approach, without data selection and planning, outperforms the previous state of the art on the Rotowire NLG task. We participated to the \u201cDocument Generation and Translation\u201d task at WNGT 2019, and ranked first in all tracks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts language models\"*\n\n*Damai Dai, Chengqi Deng, Chenggang Zhao, R. Xu, Huazuo Gao, Deli Chen, Jiashi Li, Wangding Zeng, Xingkai Yu, Yu Wu, Zhenda Xie, Y. K. Li, Panpan Huang, Fuli Luo, Chong Ruan, Zhifang Sui, W. Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations.\n\n**Abstract:** In the era of large language models, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a promising architecture for managing computational costs when scaling up model parameters. However, conventional MoE architectures like GShard, which activate the top-$K$ out of $N$ experts, face challenges in ensuring expert specialization, i.e. each expert acquires non-overlapping and focused knowledge. In response, we propose the DeepSeekMoE architecture towards ultimate expert specialization. It involves two principal strategies: (1) finely segmenting the experts into $mN$ ones and activating $mK$ from them, allowing for a more flexible combination of activated experts; (2) isolating $K_s$ experts as shared ones, aiming at capturing common knowledge and mitigating redundancy in routed experts. Starting from a modest scale with 2B parameters, we demonstrate that DeepSeekMoE 2B achieves comparable performance with GShard 2.9B, which has 1.5 times the expert parameters and computation. In addition, DeepSeekMoE 2B nearly approaches the performance of its dense counterpart with the same number of total parameters, which set the upper bound of MoE models. Subsequently, we scale up DeepSeekMoE to 16B parameters and show that it achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2 7B, with only about 40% of computations. Further, our preliminary efforts to scale up DeepSeekMoE to 145B parameters consistently validate its substantial advantages over the GShard architecture, and show its performance comparable with DeepSeek 67B, using only 28.5% (maybe even 18.2%) of computations.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 101  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 7.

Our investigation confirms that MoE-based LLMs can offer a more favorable cost-effectiveness trade-off than dense LLMs, highlighting the potential effectiveness for future LLM development. One more important contribution of this study is an in-depth analysis of the routing mechanisms within our OpenMoE models, leading to three significant findings: Context-Independent Specialization, Early Routing Learning, and Drop-towards-the-End. We discovered that routing decisions in MoE models are predominantly based on token IDs, with minimal context relevance. The token-to-expert assignments are determined early in the pre-training phase and remain largely unchanged. This imperfect routing can result in performance degradation, particularly in sequential tasks like multi-turn conversations, where tokens appearing later in a sequence are more likely to be dropped. Finally, we rethink our design based on the above-mentioned observations and analysis. To facilitate future MoE LLM development, we propose potential strategies for mitigating the issues we found and further improving off-the-shelf MoE LLM designs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8.

For example, thanks to scaling, GPT-3 was able to achieve strong results on in-context learning tasks. However, training these large dense models requires significant amounts of computing resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a family of language models named GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts architecture to scale the model capacity while also incurring substantially less training cost compared to dense variants. The largest GLaM has 1.2 trillion parameters, which is approximately 7x larger than GPT-3. It consumes only 1/3 of the energy used to train GPT-3 and requires half of the computation flops for inference, while still achieving better overall zero-shot and one-shot performance across 29 NLP tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 598  (*Influential: 48*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. N-ODE Transformer: A Depth-Adaptive Variant of the Transformer Using\n  Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs language models\"*\n\n*Aaron Baier-Reinio, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** We use neural ordinary differential equations to formulate a variant of the\nTransformer that is depth-adaptive in the sense that an input-dependent number\nof time steps is taken by the ordinary differential equation solver. Our goal\nin proposing the N-ODE Transformer is to investigate whether its\ndepth-adaptivity may aid in overcoming some specific known theoretical\nlimitations of the Transformer in handling nonlocal effects. Specifically, we\nconsider the simple problem of determining the parity of a binary sequence, for\nwhich the standard Transformer has known limitations that can only be overcome\nby using a sufficiently large number of layers or attention heads. We find,\nhowever, that the depth-adaptivity of the N-ODE Transformer does not provide a\nremedy for the inherently nonlocal nature of the parity problem, and provide\nexplanations for why this is so. Next, we pursue regularization of the N-ODE\nTransformer by penalizing the arclength of the ODE trajectories, but find that\nthis fails to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the N-ODE Transformer on\nthe challenging parity problem. We suggest future avenues of research for\nmodifications and extensions of the N-ODE Transformer that may lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency for sequence modelling tasks such as neural machine\ntranslation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-22T00:48:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

It is challenging to accurately\npredict the dynamics of the system if its constituent components are analyzed\nindependently. We develop a graph-based model that unveils the systemic\ninteractions of time series observed at irregular time points, by using a\ndirected acyclic graph to model the conditional dependencies (a form of causal\nnotation) of the system components and learning this graph in tandem with a\ncontinuous-time model that parameterizes the solution curves of ordinary\ndifferential equations (ODEs). Our technique, a graph neural flow, leads to\nsubstantial enhancements over non-graph-based methods, as well as graph-based\nmethods without the modeling of conditional dependencies.

SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive\n  Connection\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Mingxin Zhou, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of\ntasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the\ninput length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper,\nwe present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse\nAdaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and\nattention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with\nprevious self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model\nlearns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In\nthis way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the\nquadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show\nthat previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through\nextensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph\nrepresentation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory\ncost.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-22T07:58:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-09-29T08:01:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

HMoE: Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts language models\"*\n\n*An Wang, Xingwu Sun, Ruobing Xie, Shuaipeng Li, Jiaqi Zhu, Zhen Yang, Pinxue Zhao, J. N. Han, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Naoaki Okazaki, Cheng-zhong Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers remarkable performance and computational\nefficiency by selectively activating subsets of model parameters.\nTraditionally, MoE models use homogeneous experts, each with identical\ncapacity. However, varying complexity in input data necessitates experts with\ndiverse capabilities, while homogeneous MoE hinders effective expert\nspecialization and efficient parameter utilization. In this study, we propose a\nnovel Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE), where experts differ in size and\nthus possess diverse capacities. This heterogeneity allows for more specialized\nexperts to handle varying token complexities more effectively. To address the\nimbalance in expert activation, we propose a novel training objective that\nencourages the frequent activation of smaller experts, enhancing computational\nefficiency and parameter utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHMoE achieves lower loss with fewer activated parameters and outperforms\nconventional homogeneous MoE models on various pre-training evaluation\nbenchmarks.

MoEC: Mixture of Expert Clusters\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts language models\"*\n\n*Yuan Xie, Shaohan Huang, Tianyu Chen, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely Mixture of Experts (MoE) has received great interest due to its\npromising scaling capability with affordable computational overhead. MoE\nconverts dense layers into sparse experts, and utilizes a gated routing network\nto make experts conditionally activated. However, as the number of experts\ngrows, MoE with outrageous parameters suffers from overfitting and sparse data\nallocation. Such problems are especially severe on tasks with limited data,\nthus hindering the progress for MoE models to improve performance by scaling\nup. In this work, we propose Mixture of Expert Clusters - a general approach to\nenable expert layers to learn more diverse and appropriate knowledge by\nimposing variance-based constraints on the routing stage. We further propose a\ncluster-level expert dropout strategy specifically designed for the expert\ncluster structure. Our experiments reveal that MoEC could improve performance\non machine translation and natural language understanding tasks, and raise the\nperformance upper bound for scaling up experts under limited data. We also\nverify that MoEC plays a positive role in mitigating overfitting and sparse\ndata allocation.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning to Encode Position for Transformer with Continuous Dynamical Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs language models\"*\n\n*Cho-Jui Hsieh, Hsiang-Fu Yu, Xuanqing Liu, Inderjit Dhillon*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new way of learning to encode position information for non-recurrent models, such as Transformer models. Unlike RNN and LSTM, which contain inductive bias by loading the input tokens sequentially, non-recurrent models are less sensitive to position. The main reason is that position information among input units is not inherently encoded, i.e., the models are permutation equivalent; this problem justifies why all of the existing models are accompanied by a sinusoidal encoding/embedding layer at the input. However, this solution has clear limitations: the sinusoidal encoding is not flexible enough as it is manually designed and does not contain any learnable parameters, whereas the position embedding restricts the maximum length of input sequences. It is thus desirable to design a new position layer that contains learnable parameters to adjust to different datasets and different architectures. At the same time, we would also like the encodings to extrapolate in accordance with the variable length of inputs. In our proposed solution, we borrow from the recent Neural ODE approach, which may be viewed as a versatile continuous version of a ResNet. This model is capable of modeling many kinds of dynamical systems. We model the evolution of encoded results along position index by such a dynamical system, thereby overcoming the above limitations of existing methods. We evaluate our new position layers on a variety of neural machine translation and language understanding tasks, the experimental results show consistent improvements over the baselines.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. Predicting Opinion Dynamics via Sociologically-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs language models\"*\n\n*Tomoharu Iwata, Maya Okawa*\n\n**Abstract:** Opinion formation and propagation are crucial phenomena in social networks and have been extensively studied across several disciplines. Traditionally, theoretical models of opinion dynamics have been proposed to describe the interactions between individuals (i.e., social interaction) and their impact on the evolution of collective opinions. Although these models can incorporate sociological and psychological knowledge on the mechanisms of social interaction, they demand extensive calibration with real data to make reliable predictions, requiring much time and effort. Recently, the widespread use of social media platforms provides new paradigms to learn deep learning models from a large volume of social media data. However, these methods ignore any scientific knowledge about the mechanism of social interaction. In this work, we present the first hybrid method called Sociologically-Informed Neural Network (SINN), which integrates theoretical models and social media data by transporting the concepts of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) from natural science (i.e., physics) into social science (i.e., sociology and social psychology). In particular, we recast theoretical models as ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Then we train a neural network that simultaneously approximates the data and conforms to the ODEs that represent the social scientific knowledge. In addition, we extend PINNs by integrating matrix factorization and a language model to incorporate rich side information (e.g., user profiles) and structural knowledge (e.g., cluster structure of the social interaction network). Moreover, we develop an end-to-end training procedure for SINN, which involves Gumbel-Softmax approximation to include stochastic mechanisms of social interaction. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show SINN outperforms six baseline methods in predicting opinion dynamics.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal.

Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Chatlaw: A Multi-Agent Collaborative Legal Assistant with Knowledge Graph Enhanced Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts language models\"*\n\n*Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian, Bin Ling, Hao Li, Yang Yan, Zongjian Li, Munan Ning, Bohua Chen, Jiaxi Cui*\n\n**Abstract:** AI legal assistants based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can provide accessible legal consulting services, but the hallucination problem poses potential legal risks. This paper presents Chatlaw, an innovative legal assistant utilizing a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model and a multi-agent system to enhance the reliability and accuracy of AI-driven legal services. By integrating knowledge graphs with artificial screening, we construct a high-quality legal dataset to train the MoE model. This model utilizes different experts to address various legal issues, optimizing the accuracy of legal responses. Additionally, Standardized Operating Procedures (SOP), modeled after real law firm workflows, significantly reduce errors and hallucinations in legal services. Our MoE model outperforms GPT-4 in the Lawbench and Unified Qualification Exam for Legal Professionals by 7.73% in accuracy and 11 points, respectively, and also surpasses other models in multiple dimensions during real-case consultations, demonstrating our robust capability for legal consultation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. Fast Inference of Mixture-of-Experts Language Models with Offloading\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts language models\"*\n\n*Denis Mazur, Artyom Eliseev*\n\n**Abstract:** With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), many deep learning practitioners are looking for strategies of running these models more efficiently. One such strategy is to use sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) - a type of model architectures where only a fraction of model layers are active for any given input. This property allows MoE-based language models to generate tokens faster than their dense counterparts, but it also increases model size due to having multiple experts. Unfortunately, this makes state-of-the-art MoE language models difficult to run without high-end GPUs. In this work, we study the problem of running large MoE language models on consumer hardware with limited accelerator memory. We build upon parameter offloading algorithms and propose a novel strategy that accelerates offloading by taking advantage of innate properties of MoE LLMs. Using this strategy, we build can run Mixtral-8x7B with mixed quantization on desktop hardware and free-tier Google Colab instances.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, several key points and directions can be identified from the provided analysis and suggestions.\n\n### Key Findings and Overlap with Existing Models\n\nThe current proposal overlaps significantly with existing models such as **Hyena Hierarchy**, **Convolutional State Space Models (ConvSSM)**, **Mamba**, and **DenseSSM**.

This could be a novel way to optimize the attention mechanism, making it more efficient and scalable.\n\n#### Mixture of Experts (MoE)\n- Incorporating MoE architectures into GAUs could dynamically increase model capacity without proportional increases in computational resources.

In this work, we show that existing models fail to take full advantage of its potential. Motivated by this finding, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes linear recurrent models such as S4, S5, LRU and RetNet, by employing data-controlled state transitions. Utilizing this theoretical advance, GateLoop empirically outperforms existing models for auto-regressive language modeling. Our method comes with a low-cost $O(l)$ recurrent mode and an efficient $O(l \\log_{2} l)$ parallel mode making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. Furthermore, we derive an $O(l^2)$ surrogate attention mode, revealing remarkable implications for Transformer and recently proposed architectures. Specifically, we prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relative-positional information to Attention. While many existing models solely rely on data-controlled cumulative sums for context aggregation, our findings suggest that incorporating data-controlled complex cumulative products may be a crucial step towards more powerful sequence models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/15 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/32 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. $\\left[\\mathrm{LKV}^{+}\\right.$18] Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Charles Windolf, and Thomas Serre.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs convolutional sequence models\"*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

We introduce an architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks. Compared to recurrent models, computations over all elements can be fully parallelized during training and optimization is easier since the number of non-linearities is fixed and independent of the input length. Our use of gated linear units eases gradient propagation and we equip each decoder layer with a separate attention module. We outperform the accuracy of the deep LSTM setup of Wu et al.

Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State-Space Layers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs convolutional sequence models\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Karan Goel, Khaled Kamal Saab, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes RNN heuristics, temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations while addressing their shortcomings, and introduces a trainable subset of structured matrices that endow LSSLs with long-range memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 357  (*Influential: 22*)\n\n#### 4.

We interleave greedy criteria-based pruning with fine-tuning by backpropagation - a computationally efficient procedure that maintains good generalization in the pruned network. We propose a new criterion based on Taylor expansion that approximates the change in the cost function induced by pruning network parameters. We focus on transfer learning, where large pretrained networks are adapted to specialized tasks. The proposed criterion demonstrates superior performance compared to other criteria, e.g. the norm of kernel weights or feature map activation, for pruning large CNNs after adaptation to fine-grained classification tasks (Birds-200 and Flowers-102) relaying only on the first order gradient information. We also show that pruning can lead to more than 10x theoretical (5x practical) reduction in adapted 3D-convolutional filters with a small drop in accuracy in a recurrent gesture classifier. Finally, we show results for the large-scale ImageNet dataset to emphasize the flexibility of our approach.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 1796  (*Influential: 172*)\n\n#### 5.

The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Runtime Neural Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive token pruning in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Ji Lin, Yongming Rao, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Runtime Neural Pruning (RNP) framework which prunes the deep neural network dynamically at the runtime and preserves the full ability of the original network and conducts pruning according to the input image and current feature maps adaptively.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a Runtime Neural Pruning (RNP) framework which prunes the deep neural network dynamically at the runtime. Unlike existing neural pruning methods which produce a fixed pruned model for deployment, our method preserves the full ability of the original network and conducts pruning according to the input image and current feature maps adaptively. The pruning is performed in a bottom-up, layer-by-layer manner, which we model as a Markov decision process and use reinforcement learning for training. The agent judges the importance of each convolutional kernel and conducts channel-wise pruning conditioned on different samples, where the network is pruned more when the image is easier for the task. Since the ability of network is fully preserved, the balance point is easily adjustable according to the available resources. Our method can be applied to off-the-shelf network structures and reach a better tradeoff between speed and accuracy, especially with a large pruning rate.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 456  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 7.

Darrell, Denny Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** The advancements embodied by FLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing inference cost. Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMs to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, FLAN-MOE-32B, surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM-62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs. The advancements embodied byFLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Scaling Vision-Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts convolutional language models\"*\n\n*Sheng Shen, Z. Yao, Chunyuan Li, Trevor Darrell, K. Keutzer, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** The effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models is explored, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

For example, thanks to scaling, GPT-3 was able to achieve strong results on in-context learning tasks. However, training these large dense models requires significant amounts of computing resources. In this paper, we propose and develop a family of language models named GLaM (Generalist Language Model), which uses a sparsely activated mixture-of-experts architecture to scale the model capacity while also incurring substantially less training cost compared to dense variants. The largest GLaM has 1.2 trillion parameters, which is approximately 7x larger than GPT-3. It consumes only 1/3 of the energy used to train GPT-3 and requires half of the computation flops for inference, while still achieving better overall zero-shot and one-shot performance across 29 NLP tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 598  (*Influential: 48*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Depthwise Separable Convolutions for Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs convolutional sequence models\"*\n\n*Lukasz Kaiser, Aidan N.

They have been shown to be successful in image classification\nmodels, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given\nparameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the\nnumber of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets\nfamily of architectures).

In addition to\nshowing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine\ntranslation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we\nobserve that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of\nconvolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a\nnew \"super-separable\" convolution operation that further reduces the number of\nparameters and computational cost for obtaining state-of-the-art results.\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-09T17:59:16Z  (*Updated: 2017-06-16T02:35:48Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we propose a\nnovel model adaptation paradigm, adapting by pruning, which prunes neural\nconnections in the pre-trained model to optimise the performance on the target\ntask; all remaining connections have their weights intact.

Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive token pruning in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Chenxi Liu, Sun Yang, Qianxiong Xu, Zhishuai Li, Cheng Long, Ziyue Li, Rui Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Traffic prediction, an essential component for intelligent transportation\nsystems, endeavours to use historical data to foresee future traffic features\nat specific locations. Although existing traffic prediction models often\nemphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not\nimproved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities\nin time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly\nthrough parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their\nfundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a\nSpatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the\nST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a\nspatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal\npatterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a\nfusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation.\nFurthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM\nto capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction.\nComprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM\nis a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot\nand zero-shot prediction scenarios.

N. Han, Zhanhui Kang, Di Wang, Naoaki Okazaki, Cheng-zhong Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers remarkable performance and computational\nefficiency by selectively activating subsets of model parameters.\nTraditionally, MoE models use homogeneous experts, each with identical\ncapacity. However, varying complexity in input data necessitates experts with\ndiverse capabilities, while homogeneous MoE hinders effective expert\nspecialization and efficient parameter utilization. In this study, we propose a\nnovel Heterogeneous Mixture of Experts (HMoE), where experts differ in size and\nthus possess diverse capacities. This heterogeneity allows for more specialized\nexperts to handle varying token complexities more effectively. To address the\nimbalance in expert activation, we propose a novel training objective that\nencourages the frequent activation of smaller experts, enhancing computational\nefficiency and parameter utilization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nHMoE achieves lower loss with fewer activated parameters and outperforms\nconventional homogeneous MoE models on various pre-training evaluation\nbenchmarks.

MoEC: Mixture of Expert Clusters\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts convolutional language models\"*\n\n*Yuan Xie, Shaohan Huang, Tianyu Chen, Furu Wei*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely Mixture of Experts (MoE) has received great interest due to its\npromising scaling capability with affordable computational overhead. MoE\nconverts dense layers into sparse experts, and utilizes a gated routing network\nto make experts conditionally activated. However, as the number of experts\ngrows, MoE with outrageous parameters suffers from overfitting and sparse data\nallocation. Such problems are especially severe on tasks with limited data,\nthus hindering the progress for MoE models to improve performance by scaling\nup. In this work, we propose Mixture of Expert Clusters - a general approach to\nenable expert layers to learn more diverse and appropriate knowledge by\nimposing variance-based constraints on the routing stage. We further propose a\ncluster-level expert dropout strategy specifically designed for the expert\ncluster structure. Our experiments reveal that MoEC could improve performance\non machine translation and natural language understanding tasks, and raise the\nperformance upper bound for scaling up experts under limited data. We also\nverify that MoEC plays a positive role in mitigating overfitting and sparse\ndata allocation.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-19T06:09:55Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. CKConv: Continuous Kernel Convolution For Sequential Data\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs convolutional sequence models\"*\n\n*Mark Hoogendoorn, Jakub M. Tomczak, Erik J. Bekkers, Anna Kuzina, David W. Romero*\n\n**Abstract:** Conventional neural architectures for sequential data present important limitations. Recurrent networks suffer from exploding and vanishing gradients, small effective memory horizons, and must be trained sequentially. Convolutional networks are unable to handle sequences of unknown size and their memory horizon must be defined a priori. In this work, we show that all these problems can be solved by formulating convolutional kernels in CNNs as continuous functions. The resulting Continuous Kernel Convolution (CKConv) allows us to model arbitrarily long sequences in a parallel manner, within a single operation, and without relying on any form of recurrence. We show that Continuous Kernel Convolutional Networks (CKCNNs) obtain state-of-the-art results in multiple datasets, e.g., permuted MNIST, and, thanks to their continuous nature, are able to handle non-uniformly sampled datasets and irregularly-sampled data natively. CKCNNs match or perform better than neural ODEs designed for these purposes in a faster and simpler manner.\n\n**Conference:** ckconv-continuous-kernel-convolution-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Crop Classification under Varying Cloud Cover with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n\n*From Search Query: \"Neural ODEs convolutional sequence models\"*\n\n*Konrad Schindler, Jan Dirk Wegner, Stefano D'Aronco, Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu, Nando Metzger*\n\n**Abstract:** Optical satellite sensors cannot see the Earth's surface through clouds. Despite the periodic revisit cycle, image sequences acquired by Earth observation satellites are therefore irregularly sampled in time. State-of-the-art methods for crop classification (and other time series analysis tasks) rely on techniques that implicitly assume regular temporal spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state; and a prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where only few observations are available (i.e., frequent cloud cover). Moreover, we show that the ability to extrapolate translates to better classification performance early in the season, which is important for forecasting.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adaptive and Background-Aware Vision Transformer for Real-Time UAV Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive token pruning in convolutional networks\"*\n\n*Xucheng Wang, Dan Zeng, Yangxiang Yang, Shuiwang Li*\n\n**Abstract:**     While discriminative correlation filters (DCF)-based trackers prevail in UAV tracking for their favorable efficiency, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN)-based trackers using filter pruning have also demonstrated remarkable efficiency and precision. However, the use of pure vision transformer models (ViTs) for UAV tracking remains unexplored, which is a surprising finding given that ViTs have been shown to produce better performance and greater efficiency than CNNs in image classification. In this paper, we propose an efficient ViT-based tracking framework, Aba-ViTrack, for UAV tracking. In our framework, feature learning and template-search coupling are integrated into an efficient one-stream ViT to avoid an extra heavy relation modeling module. The proposed Aba-ViT exploits an adaptive and background-aware token computation method to reduce inference time. This approach adaptively discards tokens based on learned halting probabilities, which a priori are higher for background tokens than target ones.

Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts convolutional language models\"*\n\n*Krzysztof Maziarz, Noam Shazeer, Geoffrey Hinton, Andy Davis, Quoc Le, Jeff Dean, Azalia Mirhoseini*\n\n**Abstract:** The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by its\nnumber of parameters. Conditional computation, where parts of the network are\nactive on a per-example basis, has been proposed in theory as a way of\ndramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in\ncomputation. In practice, however, there are significant algorithmic and\nperformance challenges. In this work, we address these challenges and finally\nrealize the promise of conditional computation, achieving greater than 1000x\nimprovements in model capacity with only minor losses in computational\nefficiency on modern GPU clusters. We introduce a Sparsely-Gated\nMixture-of-Experts layer (MoE), consisting of up to thousands of feed-forward\nsub-networks. A trainable gating network determines a sparse combination of\nthese experts to use for each example. We apply the MoE to the tasks of\nlanguage modeling and machine translation, where model capacity is critical for\nabsorbing the vast quantities of knowledge available in the training corpora.\nWe present model architectures in which a MoE with up to 137 billion parameters\nis applied convolutionally between stacked LSTM layers. On large language\nmodeling and machine translation benchmarks, these models achieve significantly\nbetter results than state-of-the-art at lower computational cost.\n\n**Published:** 2017-01-23\n\n\n\n#### 5. PAD-Net: An Efficient Framework for Dynamic Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Mixture of Experts convolutional language models\"*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Fuqiang Yu, Boan Liu, Daize Dong, Liang Ding, Shwai He*\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic networks, e.g., Dynamic Convolution (DY-Conv) and the Mixture of Experts (MoE), have been extensively explored as they can considerably improve the model's representation power with acceptable computational cost. The common practice in implementing dynamic networks is to convert the given static layers into fully dynamic ones where all parameters are dynamic (at least within a single layer) and vary with the input. However, such a fully dynamic setting may cause redundant parameters and high deployment costs, limiting the applicability of dynamic networks to a broader range of tasks and models. The main contributions of our work are challenging the basic commonsense in dynamic networks and proposing a partially dynamic network, namely PAD-Net, to transform the redundant dynamic parameters into static ones. Also, we further design Iterative Mode Partition to partition dynamic and static parameters efficiently. Our method is comprehensively supported by large-scale experiments with two typical advanced dynamic architectures, i.e., DY-Conv and MoE, on both image classification and GLUE benchmarks. Encouragingly, we surpass the fully dynamic networks by $+0.7\\%$ top-1 acc with only $30\\%$ dynamic parameters for ResNet-50 and $+1.9\\%$ average score in language understanding with only $50\\%$ dynamic parameters for BERT.

Updated Summary of Analysis**\n\nAfter reviewing the new search results focused on integrating **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)**, **Adaptive Sparse Attention**, and **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** into language models, it's clear that these mechanisms offer promising avenues to enhance the original proposal. \n\nThe initial proposal aimed to improve the Conv GAU by integrating hierarchical convolutional attention, gated state space networks (SSNs), and dynamic convolutions.

However, as applications increasingly demand processing of longer sequences and larger contexts, existing state-of-the-art models like Transformers encounter significant challenges related to computational efficiency and scalability due to their quadratic complexity concerning sequence length. Additionally, while models such as FastTTTLinear have introduced improvements through Gated Linear Attention, they still face limitations in capturing hierarchical relationships and managing memory effectively over extensive contexts.\n\nTo address these challenges, this proposal presents **AdaptiveFastTTTLinear**, a novel LM block design that integrates **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** and **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)** into the existing FastTTTLinear GAU. This integration aims to enhance scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability, thereby enabling more effective processing of long-range dependencies in language modeling tasks.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Hierarchical and Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\nRecent strides in attention mechanisms focus on reducing computational complexity while maintaining or enhancing performance. Models like **Hyena** (Poli et al., 2023) and **Griffin** (De et al., 2024) introduce hierarchical convolutional architectures combined with gating mechanisms to efficiently model long-range dependencies. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models, exemplified by **PeER** (He, Owen, 2024) and **StableMoE** (Dai et al., 2022), dynamically increase model capacity by routing inputs to specialized expert networks, thereby improving performance and computational efficiency without proportional resource increases.\n\n### Neural Ordinary Differential Equations in Sequence Modeling\n\n**Neural ODEs** (Chen et al., 2018) offer a continuous-depth perspective on neural network transformations, enabling models to adapt their computational steps based on input complexity. This adaptability is particularly beneficial for sequence modeling, where different sequence segments may require varying levels of processing. Works like **Neural Flows** (Bilovs et al., 2021) and **N-ODE Transformer** (Baier-Reinio & De Sterck, 2020) have demonstrated the potential of integrating Neural ODEs with convolutional architectures to enhance flexibility and efficiency in sequence models.\n\n### Gated Mechanisms in Convolutional Networks\n\nEfficient gating mechanisms play a crucial role in controlling information flow within neural networks, enhancing feature selectivity without incurring significant computational overhead. Models such as **gMLP** (Liu et al., 2021) and **HorNet** (Rao et al., 2022) incorporate gating into MLPs and convolutional networks, respectively, to improve performance on both language and vision tasks. These mechanisms dynamically modulate feature flows based on input contexts, contributing to model robustness and adaptability.\n\n### Performance and Scalability of FastTTTLinear\n\n**FastTTTLinear** has been noted for its efficiency in handling long sequences through Gated Linear Attention, maintaining linear computational complexity while managing memory effectively. Despite its advantages, it still encounters challenges in capturing hierarchical dependencies and adaptability across varying contexts, limiting its scalability and performance compared to more recent models like MoE-based architectures and those leveraging Neural ODEs.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with FastTTTLinear\n\n1. **Hierarchical Dependency Modeling:**\n   - FastTTTLinear lacks explicit mechanisms for capturing hierarchical relationships within sequences, which are essential for understanding complex linguistic structures.\n\n2. **Scalability and Capacity:**\n   - The model's capacity is constrained by its fixed architecture, hindering its ability to scale dynamically with increasing sequence lengths and data complexities.\n\n3. **Adaptability:**\n   - FastTTTLinear\u2019s fixed computational steps restrict its ability to adapt processing depth dynamically based on input, limiting performance on varied context lengths and complexities.\n\n4. **Memory Management:**\n   - While more efficient than Transformers, there is potential for further enhancement through advanced memory management strategies to optimize usage and scalability.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\n**AdaptiveFastTTTLinear** addresses these challenges by integrating two pivotal mechanisms:\n\n1. **Mixture of Experts (MoE):**\n   - Embedding MoE within FastTTTLinear GAU allows dynamic specialization of different experts within the network, enhancing model capacity and adaptability without proportional increases in computational resources.\n\n2. **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs):**\n   - Incorporating Neural ODEs models the hidden state transformations as continuous-time dynamical systems, enabling adaptive computational depth and improved handling of long-range dependencies.\n\nThe amalgamation of MoE and Neural ODEs within FastTTTLinear GAU aims to create a more scalable, efficient, and adaptable LM block capable of handling extended contexts with enhanced hierarchical dependency modeling.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\n1. **Integrate Mixture of Experts (MoE):**\n   - Embed MoE into FastTTTLinear GAU to dynamically route input tokens to specialized expert networks based on input characteristics.\n\n2. **Incorporate Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs):**\n   - Model hidden state transformations using Neural ODEs to provide adaptive computational steps based on input sequence complexity.\n\n3. **Design Efficient Gating Mechanism:**\n   - Implement a lightweight gating mechanism to control the blending of MoE outputs and Neural ODE contributions, enhancing feature selectivity and model robustness.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1.

This module uses a simple linear layer for the ODE dynamics, but it can be expanded for more complex transformations.\n\n3. **Design Efficient Gating Mechanism:**\n   - Introduce a lightweight gating network (`self.gating`) to control the blending of MoE outputs and Neural ODE contributions. This network ensures dynamic balance based on input-context characteristics.\n\n4. **Integrate into FastTTTLinear GAU:**\n   - Create the `AdaptiveFastTTTLinearGAU` class that combines the MoE, Neural ODE, and the efficient gating mechanism. This class also includes layer normalization and output projection to stabilize inputs and map enhanced hidden states back to the original embedding dimension.\n\n5. **Layer Normalization and Output Projection:**\n   - Apply layer normalization (`self.layer_norm`) to stabilize the inputs before processing.\n   - Define an output projection layer (`self.output_proj`) to map the final hidden states back to the original embedding dimension.\n\n6. **Model Assembly:**\n   - Replace the existing FastTTTLinear GAU in the model architecture with the newly defined `AdaptiveFastTTTLinearGAU`. Ensure that the new GAU is correctly integrated within the model's GAU stack.\n\n7. **Training and Optimization:**\n   - Train the model using standard LM training procedures, optimizing parameters across MoE experts, Neural ODE, and gating networks. Ensure effective learning of gating mechanisms to balance contributions from MoE and Neural ODEs based on input characteristics.\n\n8. **Evaluation and Benchmarking:**\n   - Evaluate the enhanced LM on standard benchmarks, comparing its performance and scalability against the original FastTTTLinear GAU and other state-of-the-art models. Assess improvements in handling long-range dependencies, computational efficiency, and adaptability across varied context lengths.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**AdaptiveFastTTTLinear** significantly advances the FastTTTLinear GAU by integrating **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** and **Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs)**. This integration enhances the model's scalability, computational efficiency, and adaptability, enabling it to effectively process long-range dependencies and manage extended contexts in language modeling tasks. The inclusion of MoE allows for dynamic specialization and increased model capacity without proportional computational costs, while Neural ODEs introduce continuous and adaptive computational steps tailored to input complexity. The efficient gating mechanism ensures robust feature selectivity and balanced contributions from both MoE experts and Neural ODE transformations. Consequently, AdaptiveFastTTTLinear is poised to outperform existing FastTTTLinear implementations and offer competitive performance with state-of-the-art models like Transformers and recent MoE-based architectures.\n\n## References\n\n1.
