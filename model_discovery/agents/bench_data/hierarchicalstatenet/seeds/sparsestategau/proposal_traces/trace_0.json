    "review": "**Final Review of the HybridTTTRWKV Proposal**\n\n---\n\n**1. Clarity**\n\nThe proposal introduces **HybridTTTRWKV**, a novel language model architecture that combines the test-time training (TTT) capabilities of **FastTTTLinear** with the efficient state management and dynamic recurrence mechanisms of **RWKV6**. The objectives are clearly articulated, aiming to enhance model adaptability, expressivity, and computational efficiency in processing long sequences. The proposal provides a detailed overview of the architecture, including key components, implementation guidelines, and theoretical analysis, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the design.\n\n**2. Innovation**\n\nThe proposed architecture is innovative in its attempt to integrate test-time training with matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence mechanisms. While TTT has been explored in feedforward models and some recurrent architectures, combining it with matrix-valued states from RWKV6 and hardware-efficient linear attention mechanisms represents a novel approach. The inclusion of multi-scale convolutions and selective state updates based on content importance further differentiates the design from existing models.\n\nComparisons with existing research indicate that while individual components have been studied, the specific combination and integration proposed in HybridTTTRWKV have not been extensively explored. This suggests a potential advancement beyond current models, providing new avenues for improving language modeling, particularly for long sequences.\n\n**3. Feasibility**\n\nImplementing HybridTTTRWKV appears feasible within the given framework, although it introduces significant complexity. The proposal leverages established components such as RMSNorm, hardware-efficient linear attention, and convolutional modules, which are practical to implement. However, integrating TTT with dynamic recurrence and matrix-valued states may present challenges in terms of numerical stability and training complexity.\n\nThe proposal acknowledges potential issues, such as numerical stability when combining TTT with dynamic recurrence, and suggests strategies like using normalization techniques (e.g., LayerNorm or RMSNorm) to mitigate these concerns. The inclusion of implementation guidelines and pseudo-code demonstrates thoughtful consideration of practical implementation aspects.\n\n**4. Scalability**\n\nThe design is intended to scale efficiently with larger models and more data. By utilizing hardware-efficient linear attention and chunked processing, the model aims to maintain linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length. The selective state updates and multi-scale convolutions are designed to optimize resource utilization and accommodate long sequences without excessive computational overhead.\n\nHowever, the added complexity from integrating TTT and managing matrix-valued states may impact scalability. The potential increase in state size and the computational cost of test-time adaptation need careful management to ensure scalability is not compromised.\n\n**5. Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nThe proposal has the potential to improve model performance in terms of accuracy and robustness. Test-time training enables the model to adapt during inference, potentially improving generalization and handling of distribution shifts. The use of matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence can enhance the model's expressivity and ability to capture long-term dependencies.\n\nThe combination of hardware-efficient linear attention and multi-scale convolutions may improve the model's ability to process long sequences effectively. Selective state updates based on content importance can help the model focus on relevant information, potentially enhancing robustness to varied and noisy inputs.\n\nHowever, integrating these components may introduce challenges that could negatively impact performance if not carefully addressed. Ensuring numerical stability and effective training of the combined architecture is crucial for realizing these benefits.\n\n**6. Efficiency**\n\nThe design emphasizes computational efficiency by incorporating hardware-efficient linear attention and chunked processing. These components are known to reduce memory usage and computational cost compared to traditional attention mechanisms, particularly for long sequences.\n\nThe use of selective state updates and multi-scale convolutions aims to optimize computations by focusing on important content and capturing features at different temporal scales without unnecessary overhead.\n\nHowever, the additional complexity introduced by integrating TTT and managing matrix-valued states may offset some efficiency gains. The computational cost of test-time adaptation and the overhead of handling larger state matrices need to be carefully managed to ensure the model remains efficient.\n\n---\n\n**Strengths**\n\n- **Innovative Integration**: The proposal introduces a novel combination of test-time training with matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence, which could advance the state of the art in language modeling.\n\n- **Focus on Long Sequences**: The architecture is designed to efficiently process long sequences, addressing a significant challenge in language modeling.\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Methods**: Incorporating hardware-efficient linear attention and chunked processing aligns with current trends to improve computational efficiency.\n\n- **Adaptability and Expressivity**: Test-time adaptation and the use of matrix-valued states have the potential to enhance the model's adaptability and expressivity.\n\n**Concerns**\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: Integrating TTT with dynamic recurrence and matrix-valued states may introduce numerical instability, which could impact training and inference.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: The proposed architecture adds significant complexity, which may pose challenges in implementation, debugging, and maintenance.\n\n- **Scalability Challenges**: The potential increase in state size and computational overhead from test-time adaptation may affect scalability for very large models.\n\n- **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The proposal lacks empirical results or simulations demonstrating the effectiveness of the combined architecture, which makes it difficult to assess practical impact.\n\n---\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n1. **Address Numerical Stability in Detail**: Provide a more thorough analysis of potential numerical stability issues and propose specific techniques to mitigate them, such as advanced normalization methods or stabilized recurrent units.\n\n2. **Implementation Strategy**: Outline a clear implementation plan that addresses the complexity of integrating TTT with dynamic recurrence. Consider starting with a simplified version of the model to validate core concepts before scaling up.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation Plan**: Propose a plan for empirical evaluation, including benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to assess the model's performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n4. **Scalability Analysis**: Provide a detailed analysis of how the model scales with increased data and model sizes, including memory requirements and computational costs.\n\n5. **Comparison with Existing Models**: Include a comparison with existing models in terms of theoretical computational complexity and potential performance benefits to highlight the advantages of the proposed design.\n\n6. **Clarify Test-Time Adaptation Mechanisms**: Elaborate on how test-time adaptation will be implemented in practice, including how gradients will be computed and applied during inference without violating the causality of autoregressive models.\n\n---\n\n**Final Rating**\n\nConsidering the novel and ambitious integration of advanced techniques, the proposal demonstrates potential to contribute significantly to the field of language modeling. However, the concerns regarding numerical stability, implementation complexity, and lack of empirical validation need to be addressed to fully assess its feasibility and impact.\n\n```rating 3.5```\n\n---\n\nThis rating reflects a good design that is innovative and has potential but requires further refinement and validation to ensure feasibility and effectiveness.",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved significant empirical success in recent years. However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/32 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n## 2. Background\n\n### 2.1. Self Attention\n\nIf we have an input $\\mathbf{X}$ that belongs to $\\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ represents sequence length and $d$ represents the embedding dimension, the attention mechanism produces pair-wise scores denoted as $\\mathbf{M}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{M}=\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights, and $\\sigma$ is the attention function.

Linear attention Taking Norm as $\\sigma$ (Qin et al., 2024), to take advantage of the computational efficiency inherent in right matrix multiplication, the attention score $\\mathbf{M}$ can be transformed into its linear variant, which is mathematically equivalent due to the properties of matrix multiplication. $$\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\text {linear }}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n### 2.2. Linear Recurrent Models\n\nContinuous formulation. A model with a continuous time latent space transforms a one-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ into a latent state $x(t)$ that has $d_{s}$ dimensions, and then this $x(t)$ is transformed into a one-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Clearly, we can define the process:\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Eq. 3 is utilized in prior research to model long sequences. For instance, Gu et al. (2020a) suggests a set of matrices called HiPPO (high-order polynomial projection operators) to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are constructed to enable the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ to remember the history of the input $u(t)$ up to the present.\n```\n\n#### 5.

For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention recurrent neural networks state management\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Smith, Albert Gu, Anushan Fernando, Caglar Gulcehre, Razvan Pascanu, Soham De*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, whileAlso introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer fast inference on long sequences but are hard to optimize and slow to train. Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 2. Hidden Traveling Waves bind Working Memory Variables in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention recurrent neural networks state management*\n\n*Arjun Karuvally, T. Sejnowski, H. Siegelmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem, and suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential in advancing neural network architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Traveling waves are a fundamental phenomenon in the brain, playing a crucial role in short-term information storage. In this study, we leverage the concept of traveling wave dynamics within a neural lattice to formulate a theoretical model of neural working memory, study its properties, and its real world implications in AI. The proposed model diverges from traditional approaches, which assume information storage in static, register-like locations updated by interference. Instead, the model stores data as waves that is updated by the wave's boundary conditions. We rigorously examine the model's capabilities in representing and learning state histories, which are vital for learning history-dependent dynamical systems. The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem. To understand the model's real-world applicability, we explore two cases: linear boundary condition (LBC) and non-linear, self-attention-driven boundary condition (SBC). The model with the linear boundary condition results in a shift matrix plus low-rank matrix currently used in H3 state space RNN. Further, our experiments with LBC reveal that this matrix is effectively learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) through backpropagation when modeling history-dependent dynamical systems. Conversely, the SBC parallels the autoregressive loop of an attention-only transformer with the context vector representing the wave substrate. Collectively, our findings suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential in advancing neural network architectures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Learning Low Dimensional State Spaces with Overparameterized Recurrent Neural Nets\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention recurrent neural networks state management*\n\n*Edo Cohen-Karlik, Itamar Menuhin-Gruman, Nadav Cohen, R. Giryes, A. Globerson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes the extrapolation properties of Gradient Descent when applied to overparameterized linear RNNs and provides theoretical evidence for learning low-dimensional state spaces, which can also model long-term memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterization in deep learning typically refers to settings where a trained neural network (NN) has representational capacity to fit the training data in many ways, some of which generalize well, while others do not. In the case of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), there exists an additional layer of overparameterization, in the sense that a model may exhibit many solutions that generalize well for sequence lengths seen in training, some of which extrapolate to longer sequences, while others do not. Numerous works have studied the tendency of Gradient Descent (GD) to fit overparameterized NNs with solutions that generalize well. On the other hand, its tendency to fit overparameterized RNNs with solutions that extrapolate has been discovered only recently and is far less understood. In this paper, we analyze the extrapolation properties of GD when applied to overparameterized linear RNNs. In contrast to recent arguments suggesting an implicit bias towards short-term memory, we provide theoretical evidence for learning low-dimensional state spaces, which can also model long-term memory. Our result relies on a dynamical characterization which shows that GD (with small step size and near-zero initialization) strives to maintain a certain form of balancedness, as well as on tools developed in the context of the moment problem from statistics (recovery of a probability distribution from its moments). Experiments corroborate our theory, demonstrating extrapolation via learning low-dimensional state spaces with both linear and non-linear RNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Reverse engineering recurrent neural networks with Jacobian switching linear dynamical systems\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention recurrent neural networks state management*\n\n*Jimmy Smith, Scott W. Linderman, David Sussillo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This model removes the post-training fixed point optimization and allows us to unambiguously study the learned dynamics of the SLDS at any point in state-space, and generalizes SLDS models to continuous manifolds of switching points while sharing parameters across switches.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful models for processing time-series data, but it remains challenging to understand how they function. Improving this understanding is of substantial interest to both the machine learning and neuroscience communities. The framework of reverse engineering a trained RNN by linearizing around its fixed points has provided insight, but the approach has significant challenges. These include difficulty choosing which fixed point to expand around when studying RNN dynamics and error accumulation when reconstructing the nonlinear dynamics with the linearized dynamics. We present a new model that overcomes these limitations by co-training an RNN with a novel switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) formulation. A first-order Taylor series expansion of the co-trained RNN and an auxiliary function trained to pick out the RNN's fixed points govern the SLDS dynamics. The results are a trained SLDS variant that closely approximates the RNN, an auxiliary function that can produce a fixed point for each point in state-space, and a trained nonlinear RNN whose dynamics have been regularized such that its first-order terms perform the computation, if possible. This model removes the post-training fixed point optimization and allows us to unambiguously study the learned dynamics of the SLDS at any point in state-space. It also generalizes SLDS models to continuous manifolds of switching points while sharing parameters across switches. We validate the utility of the model on two synthetic tasks relevant to previous work reverse engineering RNNs. We then show that our model can be used as a drop-in in more complex architectures, such as LFADS, and apply this LFADS hybrid to analyze single-trial spiking activity from the motor system of a non-human primate.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Based on recurrent neural networks (RNN), external attention information was added to hidden representations to get an attentive sentence representation. Despite the improvement over non-attentive models, the attention mechanism under RNN is not well studied. In this work, we analyze the de\ufb01ciency of traditional attention based RNN models quantitatively and qualitatively. Then we present three new RNN models that add attention information before RNN hidden representation, which shows advantage in representing sentence and achieves new state-of-art results in answer selection task.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 191  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by combining linear attention mechanisms with recurrent architectures, focusing on state management and computational efficiency, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Integration of Linear Attention with RNNs\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nLinear attention mechanisms, such as those used in Gated Linear Attention Transformers, offer efficient processing of long sequences with linear time and space complexity. These mechanisms can be integrated with RNNs to leverage the strengths of both architectures. For example, the work on \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" shows how gated linear attention can enhance the expressiveness and efficiency of models.\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\nThe concept of combining linear attention with RNNs is explored in papers like \"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models.\" This work discusses how linear attention can be used in conjunction with autoregressive decoding to improve efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n## Efficient State Representations\n\n### Matrix-Valued States\nThe RWKV6 (Finch) model uses multi-headed matrix-valued states, which provide improved expressivity while maintaining RNN efficiency. Integrating such state representations with linear attention mechanisms could enhance the overall performance of the model. The paper \"Eagle and Finch: RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence\" provides insights into how these matrix-valued states can be efficiently managed and utilized.\n\n### Simplified RNN Architectures\nRecent work on simplifying traditional RNN architectures, such as LSTMs and GRUs, to make them more efficient and parallelizable can also be beneficial. The paper \"Were RNNs All We Needed?\" discusses how modifications to LSTMs and GRUs can remove their hidden state dependencies, allowing for parallel training and improving computational efficiency.\n\n## Test-Time Adaptation in Stateful Models\n\n### Dynamic Recurrence and Gating\nThe RWKV6 model's dynamic recurrence mechanism and the use of gating in FastTTTLinear can be combined to enable test-time adaptation. This integration can leverage the strengths of both models, allowing for efficient long sequence processing and maintaining model expressiveness through gating mechanisms.\n\n### Unified State Representation\nCreating a unified state representation that combines the matrix-valued states of RWKV6 with the gating mechanisms of FastTTTLinear could be a key innovation. This would allow for efficient state management and test-time adaptation, ensuring the model remains adaptable and expressive during inference.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Computational Efficiency\nThe use of linear attention mechanisms, such as ProbSparse self-attention, can significantly reduce computational complexity. For example, the \"Attention-Linear Trajectory Prediction\" model achieves a computational complexity of O(Llog L) for sequence correlation extraction, which is more efficient than traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\nDeveloping hybrid attention mechanisms that leverage both linear attention and the dynamic recurrence of RNNs can provide a balanced approach to handling long-range dependencies and efficient computation. This is an area where further innovation could lead to significant improvements in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop novel autoregressive language models that combine the efficiency of linear attention, the expressiveness of matrix-valued states, and the adaptability of dynamic recurrence and gating mechanisms, ultimately leading to better performance, scalability, and efficiency.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Score: 0.13)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. A New Perspective on \"How Graph Neural Networks Go Beyond Weisfeiler-Lehman?\"\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Asiri Wijesinghe, Qing Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural model, called GraphSNN, and proves that this model is strictly more expressive than the Weisfeiler Lehman test in distinguishing graph structures, and empirically verify the strength of the model on different graph learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new perspective on designing powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In a nutshell, this enables a general solution to inject structural properties of graphs into a message-passing aggregation scheme of GNNs. As a theoretical basis, we develop a new hierarchy of local isomorphism on neighborhood sub-graphs. Then, we theoretically characterize how message-passing GNNs can be designed to be more expressive than the Weisfeiler Lehman test. To elaborate this characterization, we propose a novel neural model, called GraphSNN , and prove that this model is strictly more expressive than the Weisfeiler Lehman test in distinguishing graph structures. We empirically verify the strength of our model on different graph learning tasks.

Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*B. Chamberlain, S. Shirobokov, Emanuele Rossi, Fabrizio Frasca, Thomas Markovich, Nils Y. Hammerla, Michael M. Bronstein, Max Hansmire*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction is proposed, which is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** Many Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) perform poorly compared to simple heuristics on Link Prediction (LP) tasks. This is due to limitations in expressive power such as the inability to count triangles (the backbone of most LP heuristics) and because they can not distinguish automorphic nodes (those having identical structural roles). Both expressiveness issues can be alleviated by learning link (rather than node) representations and incorporating structural features such as triangle counts. Since explicit link representations are often prohibitively expensive, recent works resorted to subgraph-based methods, which have achieved state-of-the-art performance for LP, but suffer from poor efficiency due to high levels of redundancy between subgraphs. We analyze the components of subgraph GNN (SGNN) methods for link prediction. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel full-graph GNN called ELPH (Efficient Link Prediction with Hashing) that passes subgraph sketches as messages to approximate the key components of SGNNs without explicit subgraph construction. ELPH is provably more expressive than Message Passing GNNs (MPNNs). It outperforms existing SGNN models on many standard LP benchmarks while being orders of magnitude faster. However, it shares the common GNN limitation that it is only efficient when the dataset fits in GPU memory. Accordingly, we develop a highly scalable model, called BUDDY, which uses feature precomputation to circumvent this limitation without sacrificing predictive performance. Our experiments show that BUDDY also outperforms SGNNs on standard LP benchmarks while being highly scalable and faster than ELPH.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 59  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. Neural Wave Machines: Learning Spatiotemporally Structured Representations with Locally Coupled Oscillatory Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Thomas Anderson Keller, M. Welling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the Neural Wave Machine (NWM) \u2013 a locally coupled oscillatory recurrent neural network capable of exhibiting traveling waves in its hidden state and shows that this model indeed learns static spatial structure such as topographic organization, and further uses complex spatiotemporal structuresuch as traveling waves to encode observed transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Traveling waves have been measured at a diversity of regions and scales in the brain, however a consensus as to their computational purpose has yet to be reached. An intriguing hypothesis is that traveling waves serve to structure neural representations both in space and time, thereby acting as an inductive bias towards natural data. In this work, we investigate this hypothesis by introducing the Neural Wave Machine (NWM) \u2013 a locally coupled oscillatory recurrent neural network capable of exhibiting traveling waves in its hidden state. After training on simple dynamic sequences, we show that this model indeed learns static spatial structure such as topographic organization, and further uses complex spatiotemporal structure such as traveling waves to encode observed transformations. To measure the computational implications of this structure, we use a suite of sequence classification and physical dynamics modeling tasks to show that the NWM is both more parameter efficient, and is able to forecast future trajectories of simple physical dynamical systems more accurately than existing state of the art counterparts. We conclude with a discussion of how this model may allow for novel investigations of the computational hypotheses surrounding traveling waves which were previously challenging or impossible.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Mingxing Tan, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new scaling method is proposed that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient and is demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet.

HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Hierarchical-Split Block contains many hierarchical split and concatenate connections within one single residual block. We find multi-scale features is of great importance for numerous vision tasks. Moreover, Hierarchical-Split block is very flexible and efficient, which provides a large space of potential network architectures for different applications. In this work, we present a common backbone based on Hierarchical-Split block for tasks: image classification, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic image segmentation/parsing. Our approach shows significant improvements over all these core tasks in comparison with the baseline. As shown in Figure1, for image classification, our 50-layers network(HS-ResNet50) achieves 81.28% top-1 accuracy with competitive latency on ImageNet-1k dataset.

Deep Polynomial Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state representations neural networks efficiency*\n\n*Stylianos Moschoglou, Grigorios Chrysos, Yannis Panagakis, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Giorgos Bouritsas, Jiankang Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are currently the method of choice both for generative, as well as for discriminative learning in computer vision and machine learning. The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers, sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we propose $\\Pi$-Nets, a new class of function approximators based on polynomial expansions. $\\Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. The unknown parameters, which are naturally represented by high-order tensors, are estimated through a collective tensor factorization with factors sharing. We introduce three tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks. We empirically demonstrate that $\\Pi$-Nets are very expressive and they even produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used in conjunction with activation functions, $\\Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art results in three challenging tasks, i.e. image generation, face verification and 3D mesh representation learning.

These networks connect neurons in a hierarchical manner to decompose complex behaviors into subprograms. This structure allows HRNNs to predict and manage information at different time scales effectively, similar to the hierarchical models inspired by philosopher Henri Bergson's theories of memory.\n\n### Multiple Timescales Recurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN)\nMTRNNs simulate the functional hierarchy of the brain by self-organizing neurons with distinct time properties. This model segments continuous sequences into reusable primitives, which are then integrated into diverse sequential behaviors. This hierarchical structure enables the model to handle long-term and short-term dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Efficient State Compression/Expansion\n\n### Neural History Compressor\nThe neural history compressor is an unsupervised stack of RNNs that learns to predict and compress inputs. It uses a hierarchical structure where higher-level RNNs study compressed representations of the information from lower-level RNNs. This approach minimizes the description length of the data and allows for efficient state compression and expansion by focusing only on unpredictable inputs.\n\n### Hierarchical Deep Neural Networks (HDNN)\nHDNNs, as used in storm surge prediction, employ a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This reduction streamlines the learning process, and the HDNN maps storm parameters to low-dimensional representations, allowing for efficient sequential predictions across different time scales. This method is effective in handling high-dimensional data while mitigating the accumulation of prediction errors over time.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Chunked/Tiled Processing\nEfficient hardware implementation can be achieved through chunked or tiled processing strategies. This approach is crucial for balancing parallelization with memory usage. By processing data in chunks or tiles, models can leverage hardware resources more efficiently, reducing computational overhead and memory requirements[Analysis Note: Round 1].\n\n### Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (h-GNN)\nAlthough h-GNNs are primarily used for image matching, their hierarchical structure and successive clustering technique (SC+PCA) can provide insights into efficient state management. The h-GNN preserves both local and global information by organizing graphs into multiple hierarchical levels, which can be analogous to managing states in hierarchical neural networks. This approach ensures that the network's depth is increased efficiently without compromising on the preservation of critical information.\n\n## Key Insights for Design\n\n### Hierarchical State Structure\nCombining hierarchical state representations with selective update mechanisms (as suggested by the Mamba and HGRN2 papers) can enhance the model's ability to manage states efficiently. This involves using matrix-valued states and hierarchical structures to handle different temporal scales[Analysis Note: Round 1].\n\n### Selective State Updates\nImplementing selective state updates, such as data-dependent decays or forget gates, allows the model to retain only important information, thus optimizing state management and reducing computational overhead[Analysis Note: Round 1].\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nDesigning models with hardware-aware implementations, such as using chunked linear attention and tiling strategies, is essential for efficient processing. This approach ensures that the model leverages hardware resources optimally, balancing parallelization and memory usage[Analysis Note: Round 1].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and capable of handling complex temporal dependencies and hierarchical state representations.\n",

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3. Performance of pixel-level classification on the sCIFAR. | Model | Accuracy (\\%) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Attention: |  |\n| Transformer (Trinh et al., 2018) | 62.20 |\n| $R N N:$ |  |\n| LSTM (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) | 63.01 |\n| r-LSTM (Trinh et al., 2018) | 72.20 |\n| UR-GRU (Gu et al., 2020b) | 74.40 |\n| HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020a) | 61.10 |\n| LipschitzRNN (Erichson et al., 2020) | 64.20 |\n| State Space Models: |  |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2022) | 91.80 |\n| S4D (Gu et al., 2022) | 90.69 |\n| S5 (Smith et al., 2023) | 90.10 |\n| Liquid-S4 (Hasani et al., 2022) | 92.02 |\n| Convolution: |  |\n| TrellisNet (Bai et al., 2018) | 73.42 |\n| CKConv (Li et al., 2022) | 63.74 |\n| FlexConv (Romero et al., 2021) | 80.82 |\n| MultiresNet (Shi et al., 2023) | $\\mathbf{9 3 . 1 5}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 2}$ |\n\nmodeling, presenting a significant challenge to models. It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/32 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nLi ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTo mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favourable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms test-time training hardware optimization*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3).

Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

InfoNet: Neural Estimation of Mutual Information without Test-Time Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms test-time training hardware optimization*\n\n*Zhengyang Hu, Song Kang, Qunsong Zeng, Kaibin Huang, Yanchao Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures and evaluates the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed mutual information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Estimating mutual correlations between random variables or data streams is essential for intelligent behavior and decision-making. As a fundamental quantity for measuring statistical relationships, mutual information has been extensively studied and utilized for its generality and equitability. However, existing methods often lack the efficiency needed for real-time applications, such as test-time optimization of a neural network, or the differentiability required for end-to-end learning, like histograms. We introduce a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures. By maximizing a dual formulation of mutual information through large-scale simulated training, our approach circumvents time-consuming test-time optimization and offers generalization ability. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed mutual information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications. Our results demonstrate that InfoNet and its training process provide a graceful efficiency-accuracy trade-off and order-preserving properties. We will make the code and models available as a comprehensive toolbox to facilitate studies in different fields requiring real-time mutual information estimation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms test-time training hardware optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. M-L2O: Towards Generalizable Learning-to-Optimize by Test-Time Fast Self-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanisms test-time training hardware optimization*\n\n*Junjie Yang, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps, by proposing a proposed framework (termed as M-L2O).\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting\"specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results. Codes are available in https://github.com/VITA-Group/M-L2O.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by combining different attention mechanisms, integrating test-time training, and optimizing hardware efficiency, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n### Dynamic Sparse Attention\nThe CASAK-V model introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that adapts to different tasks and inputs. This approach involves sparse attention computation and adaptive KV-cache management, which significantly reduces memory usage and improves inference speed. This method can be integrated with other attention mechanisms to enhance efficiency and performance.\n\n### Differential Attention\nMicrosoft's Differential Transformer uses a differential attention mechanism that partitions the query and key vectors into two groups and computes two separate softmax attention maps. The difference between these maps is used as the attention score, which helps in canceling out noise and focusing on relevant information. This mechanism can be combined with other attention strategies to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model.\n\n## Test-Time Adaptation Methods\n\n### Test-Time Training Capability\nFastTTTLinear's test-time training capability can be integrated with stateful architectures like RWKV6. This involves using matrix-valued states from RWKV6 as the base structure and implementing test-time adaptation mechanisms to allow the model to adapt to new inputs during inference. Selective update mechanisms can be added to efficiently retain relevant information (Analysis Note: Round 2).\n\n### Content-Based State Updates\nContent-based state updates, as suggested by the Mamba paper, can be crucial for addressing the weakness of models in performing content-based reasoning. This can be achieved by letting the state management parameters be functions of the input, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information based on the content (Analysis Note: Round 2).\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### FlashAttention\nFlashAttention is an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach can be adopted to optimize the hardware efficiency of hybrid attention architectures by reducing memory access and improving computational efficiency (Analysis Note: Round 2).\n\n### FPGA and ASIC Accelerators\nThe FAMOUS accelerator for dense multi-head attention on FPGAs is designed to maximize the utilization of BRAM and DSPs, achieving low latency and high throughput. Similar hardware optimization strategies can be applied to other attention mechanisms to ensure efficient processing. For instance, using specialized ASICs like SpAtten, which utilize sparsity and quantization, can further reduce computations and memory access.\n\n### 16-bit Precision Training\nUsing 16-bit precision for training and inference, as demonstrated in the study on standalone 16-bit training, can significantly speed up training times without compromising accuracy. This can be particularly beneficial for large-scale models, reducing the computational and memory footprint while maintaining performance.\n\n## Integration and Optimization\n\n### Combining Attention Mechanisms\nMerging different attention mechanisms, such as combining GLA with RWKV6's chunking strategy, can leverage the strengths of each approach. For example, using local convolutions for enhanced context and maintaining a causal structure for autoregressive modeling can improve both efficiency and performance (Analysis Note: Round 2).\n\n### Hierarchical State Structure\nImplementing a hierarchical state structure for different temporal scales can help in managing complex sequences efficiently. This structure, combined with selective update mechanisms, can ensure that the model retains only the most relevant information, thus optimizing both state management and computational efficiency (Analysis Note: Round 2).\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014hybrid attention architectures, test-time adaptation methods, and hardware-efficient implementations\u2014the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that is not only highly performant but also efficient in terms of computational resources and memory usage.\n",

Why Combining Long Conv and Attention? As mentioned in Section 1, both long convolution and linear attention mechanisms have their limitations in spite of their widespread use and impressive accomplishments in sequence modeling. By bridging their benefits together, we push the limitation of the hybrid model, which allows us to benefit from the strong inductive bias of structured memory while still having the ability to learn complex datadependent patterns in true linear time with respect to length. The following two issues are the two main obstacles to extreme performance in long-sequence modeling. Linear Attention is the Efficiency Bottleneck. We can see from Fig. 1 right that as the input sequence grows, the actual efficiency of linear attention is much lower than that of S4, despite the fact that the complexity of the S 4 model is $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ as for long convolution and $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ for linear attention. The two obstacles to achieving a practical wall-clock speedup are intensive GPU memory access and cumulative summation (cumsum) in a casual setting. Inspired by Flashattention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), we effectively doubled the speed of linear attention. Long Convolution Needs Short Convolutions. To match the efficiency of hardware-efficient linear attention, the long convolution is considered as a simpler and faster SSM model for long sequence abstraction. However, it requires additional constraint regularizations for stable performance on different data types. This is because it is hard for a single long convolutional kernel to learn multiple frequencies simultaneously, i.e., token patterns that repeat a lot versus those that occur more sparsely. We thereby introduce multiresolution short convolutional kernels to share the learning pressure of long convolution. They can also be reparameterized by simple linear transformation into a single kernel to speed up the inference phase. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-04.jpg?height=610&width=1446&top_left_y=222&top_left_x=270)\n\nFigure 2. CHELA-model architecture. Figure (a) shows the CHELA layer. Figure (b) is a simplified graphic demonstration of the key components of CHELA: Short-Long Convolutions and Flash Linear Attention. HBM and SRAM denote high bandwidth memory and static random-access memory in GPU, respectively. ## 4. CHELA: Short-Long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\nIn this section, motivated by the above issues, we propose CHELA, short-long convolutions with hardware-efficient linear attention, which fully enjoys the benefits of each. We first describe how the tiling method is used in linear attention to reach the theoretical performance. We then introduce a simple and effective module named short-long convolutions to enhance the ability of global abstraction in this hybrid design. The blocks of CHELA are demonstrated in detailed architecture, including feed-forward and normalization layers. Moreover, we also discuss the relationship between CHELA and two closely related hybrid models: MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), SPADE (Zuo et al., 2023). ### 4.1. Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\n\nIn response to the first question, we follow a tiling approach from GLA (Yang et al., 2024), which employs the classic\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-04.jpg?height=419&width=777&top_left_y=1924&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 3. Illustration Short-long Module and the effect of Short Convolution.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/32 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIt is worth noting that their complexity is essentially quadratic, and the corresponding linear versions both suffer performance degradation (see Fig. 1 left). While it is true that the simple use of a chunk linearization strategy can rival the speed of SSMs, the drop in performance is significant. We, therefore, abandon this strategy and the softmax function to accelerate the linear attention operations of the kernel-based approach. In addition, long convolution (Fu et al., 2023b) is more efficient and easier to implement than the traditional SSMs. We believe combining these two modules could release the true power of the hybrid model with faster speed and better performance. However, the existence of such a dilemma is worth considering: (1) the linear attention in hybrid models is a speed bottleneck for long convolution, the comparison is shown in Fig. 1 right; (2) the instability of long convolution makes attention hard to optimize. Specifically, due to the intense memory access (I/O) on the GPU and cumulative summation (cumsum) operation in a casual setting,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-02.jpg?height=550&width=1454&top_left_y=224&top_left_x=300)\n\nFigure 1. Demonstration of (left) comparison of various popular models on the Long Range Arena Dataset, and (right) speed benchmark on different implementations of attentions. Figure left, despite showing promising performance of SSM-Attention models, the linear version of these models degenerated. Figure right benchmarks attention speed with around 200 M parameters, showing linear attention is not linear with sequence length and is significantly slower than S 4 , which can be a speed bottleneck in these hybrid designs. the notable reduction in complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ in linear attention is only theoretical (Qin et al., 2024); On the other hand, the long convolution needs hand-crafted regularizations to prevent over-fitting high-frequency noise. To escape the dilemma, we have developed a novel model called CHELA, which stands for short-long Convolutional with Hardware-Efficient $\\underline{\\text { Linear }} \\underline{\\text { Attention. This model is }}$ designed to effectively and efficiently capture complex dependencies in long inputs. Inspired by FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023), the model comprises multiple layers of real linear token mixers with hardware-friendly implementation with a gating mechanism that achieves comparable performance to full attention. We have added a stabilizer, reparameterizable (Ding et al., 2022; 2023) short-long convolutions, to the bottom layer of the long convolution to integrate multiple frequencies with inputs. As a result, the top layers of CHELA capture more refined data-dependent information using linear attention, while the convolutions add a structural bias that enhances global abstraction in multi-level frequencies. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CHELA on various datasets and tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark (Tay et al., 2020b), which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, CHELA is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer but also yields better performance. In all the settings, CHELA outperforms the baselines. Finally, we provide further analysis and ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness. Our contribution can be summarized in three folds:\n\n- Efficient Implementation: We release the potential speed of linear attention in the attention-ssm hybrid model, maintaining a constant rate regardless of sequence length with fixed memory. - New Design: We improve multi-frequency learning with multi-level convolutional hierarchies, leading to better performance and stability for long convolution. - Promising Results: By connecting the above two basic modules, we propose CHELA for efficient long sequence learners are capable of both global information abstraction and fine-grained data-dependent selection.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/32 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nLi ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTo mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favourable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2.

RNNs integrate context information by updating a hidden state at every time-step, CNNs summarize a fixed size context through multiple layers, while as self-attention directly summarizes all context. Attention assigns context elements attention weights which define a weighted sum over context representations (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Source-target attention summarizes information from another sequence such as in machine translation while as self-attention operates over the current sequence. Self-attention has been formulated as content-based where attention weights are computed by comparing the current time-step to all elements in the context (Figure 1a). The ability to compute comparisons over such unrestricted context sizes are seen as a key characteristic of self-attention (Vaswani et al., 2017). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5c8e090190e689be38d0g-01.jpg?height=267&width=1369&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 1: Self-attention computes attention weights by comparing all pairs of elements to each other (a) while as dynamic convolutions predict separate kernels for each time-step (b). However, the ability of self-attention to model long-range dependencies has recently come into question (Tang et al., 2018) and the unlimited context size is computationally very challenging due to the quadratic complexity in the input length. Furthermore, in practice long sequences require the introduction of hierarchies (Liu et al., 2018). [^0]In this paper, we introduce lightweight convolutions which are depth-wise separable (Sifre, 2014 , Chollet, 2017; Kaiser et al, 2017), softmax-normalized and share weights over the channel dimension. The result is a convolution with several orders of magnitude fewer weights than a standard nonseparable convolution. Different to self-attention, lightweight convolutions reuse the same weights for context elements, regardless of the current time-step. Dynamic convolutions build on lightweight convolutions by predicting a different convolution kernel at every time-step. The kernel is a function of the current time-step only as opposed to the entire context as in self-attention (Figure 1b). Dynamic convolutions are similar to locally connected layers in the sense that the weights change at every position, however, the difference is that weights are dynamically generated by the model rather than fixed after training (LeCun et al., 1998; Taigman et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.38)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

CoAtNet: Marrying Convolution and Attention for All Data Sizes\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents CoAtNets, a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention and (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have attracted increasing interests in computer vision, but they still fall behind state-of-the-art convolutional networks. In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 994  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 2. Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A. Wright, Azalia Mirhoseini, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel readout mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding, and suggests that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long- range relationships on graphs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

Graph Metanetworks for Processing Diverse Neural Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Derek Lim, Haggai Maron, Marc T. Law, Jonathan Lorraine, James Lucas*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged, and generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks efficiently encode learned information within their parameters. Consequently, many tasks can be unified by treating neural networks themselves as input data. When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the importance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces. However, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such as MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such architectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks - neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on several metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. A Unified Weight Initialization Paradigm for Tensorial Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Y. Pan, Zeyong Su, Ao Liu, Jingquan Wang, Nannan Li, Zenglin Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a universal weight initialization paradigm, which generalizes Xavier and Kaiming methods and can be widely applicable to arbitrary TCNNs, and demonstrates that this paradigm can stabilize the training of TCnns, leading to faster convergence and better results.\n\n**Abstract:** Tensorial Convolutional Neural Networks (TCNNs) have attracted much research attention for their power in reducing model parameters or enhancing the generalization ability. However, exploration of TCNNs is hindered even from weight initialization methods. To be specific, general initialization methods, such as Xavier or Kaiming initialization, usually fail to generate appropriate weights for TCNNs. Meanwhile, although there are ad-hoc approaches for specific architectures (e.g., Tensor Ring Nets), they are not applicable to TCNNs with other tensor decomposition methods (e.g., CP or Tucker decomposition). To address this problem, we propose a universal weight initialization paradigm, which generalizes Xavier and Kaiming methods and can be widely applicable to arbitrary TCNNs. Specifically, we first present the Reproducing Transformation to convert the backward process in TCNNs to an equivalent convolution process. Then, based on the convolution operators in the forward and backward processes, we build a unified paradigm to control the variance of features and gradients in TCNNs. Thus, we can derive fan-in and fan-out initialization for various TCNNs. We demonstrate that our paradigm can stabilize the training of TCNNs, leading to faster convergence and better results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Next-ViT: Next Generation Vision Transformer for Efficient Deployment in Realistic Industrial Scenarios\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Xin Pan, Min Zheng, Rui Wang, Xuefeng Xiao, Xing Wang, Huixia Li, Wei Li, Xin Xia, Jiashi Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the complex attention mechanisms and model design, most existing vision Transformers (ViTs) can not perform as efficiently as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in realistic industrial deployment scenarios, e.g. TensorRT and CoreML. This poses a distinct challenge: Can a visual neural network be designed to infer as fast as CNNs and perform as powerful as ViTs? Recent works have tried to design CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures to address this issue, yet the overall performance of these works is far away from satisfactory. To end these, we propose a next generation vision Transformer for efficient deployment in realistic industrial scenarios, namely Next-ViT, which dominates both CNNs and ViTs from the perspective of latency/accuracy trade-off. In this work, the Next Convolution Block (NCB) and Next Transformer Block (NTB) are respectively developed to capture local and global information with deployment-friendly mechanisms. Then, Next Hybrid Strategy (NHS) is designed to stack NCB and NTB in an efficient hybrid paradigm, which boosts performance in various downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that Next-ViT significantly outperforms existing CNNs, ViTs and CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures with respect to the latency/accuracy trade-off across various vision tasks. On TensorRT, Next-ViT surpasses ResNet by 5.5 mAP (from 40.4 to 45.9) on COCO detection and 7.7% mIoU (from 38.8% to 46.5%) on ADE20K segmentation under similar latency. Meanwhile, it achieves comparable performance with CSWin, while the inference speed is accelerated by 3.6x. On CoreML, Next-ViT surpasses EfficientFormer by 4.6 mAP (from 42.6 to 47.2) on COCO detection and 3.5% mIoU (from 45.1% to 48.6%) on ADE20K segmentation under similar latency.

LambdaNetworks: Modeling Long-Range Interactions Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: convolution attention hybrid architectures neural networks*\n\n*Irwan Bello*\n\n**Abstract:** We present lambda layers -- an alternative framework to self-attention -- for capturing long-range interactions between an input and structured contextual information (e.g. a pixel surrounded by other pixels). Lambda layers capture such interactions by transforming available contexts into linear functions, termed lambdas, and applying these linear functions to each input separately. Similar to linear attention, lambda layers bypass expensive attention maps, but in contrast, they model both content and position-based interactions which enables their application to large structured inputs such as images. The resulting neural network architectures, LambdaNetworks, significantly outperform their convolutional and attentional counterparts on ImageNet classification, COCO object detection and COCO instance segmentation, while being more computationally efficient. Additionally, we design LambdaResNets, a family of hybrid architectures across different scales, that considerably improves the speed-accuracy tradeoff of image classification models. LambdaResNets reach excellent accuracies on ImageNet while being 3.2 - 4.4x faster than the popular EfficientNets on modern machine learning accelerators. When training with an additional 130M pseudo-labeled images, LambdaResNets achieve up to a 9.5x speed-up over the corresponding EfficientNet checkpoints.\n\n**Conference:** lambdanetworks-modeling-long-range\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by combining convolution and attention mechanisms, here are some key techniques and insights from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n### Hybrid Architectures Combining Convolution and Attention\n\n1. **KANICE (Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Interactive Convolutional Elements)**\n   - This architecture combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) principles. It integrates Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) and KAN linear layers, which enhances feature processing and model adaptability. The ICBs use multi-scale feature extraction, adaptive feature emphasis, and enhanced non-linearity, which can be beneficial for processing diverse input sequences in language models.\n\n2. **Hybrid Transformer and CNN Architectures**\n   - The Hybrid Model with Multi-scale Deformable Attention (HMDA) combines Transformers with CNNs to leverage the strengths of both. This architecture uses a Multi-scale Spatially Adaptive Deformable Attention (MSADA) mechanism to attend to key sampling points, and a Cross Attention Bridge (CAB) module to integrate multi-scale transformer and local features. This hybrid approach can be adapted to language models to improve long-range contextual understanding and local feature extraction.\n\n3. **CHELA (Short-Long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention)**\n   - This approach combines short-long convolutions with linear attention, which is particularly efficient for handling long sequences. By replacing self-attention mechanisms with short-long convolutions and implementing linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner, CHELA achieves both efficiency and effectiveness. This can be a valuable strategy for autoregressive language models needing to process long sequences efficiently[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\n### Efficient Implementation Strategies\n\n1. **Tiling and Hierarchy**\n   - Techniques like tiling and hierarchy, as seen in CHELA and Lightning Attention-2, are crucial for efficient implementation. These methods separate intra-block and inter-block components in attention calculation, taking full advantage of GPU hardware. This can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of the model[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\n2. **IO-Aware Optimization Strategies**\n   - Implementing IO-aware algorithms, as mentioned in the context of FlashAttention and Lightning Attention-2, helps in reducing computational redundancy and improving memory efficiency. These strategies are essential for optimizing the performance of hybrid architectures on hardware[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\n3. **Chunked Processing**\n   - Chunked processing, as suggested in the analysis, improves hardware utilization by dividing the input into smaller chunks and processing them separately. This approach can be integrated with convolution and attention mechanisms to enhance efficiency[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\n### Performance Optimization Methods\n\n1. **Adaptive Feature Extraction**\n   - The use of Interactive Convolutional Blocks (ICBs) in KANICE allows for adaptive feature extraction based on the input, which can enhance the model's ability to process diverse sequences. This adaptive approach introduces stronger non-linearity and improves feature robustness.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Processing**\n   - Implementing hierarchical processing for different temporal scales, as suggested in the analysis, can help in capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies in the input sequence. This can be achieved by combining short-long convolutions with hierarchical state structures[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\n3. **Selective State Updates**\n   - Incorporating selective state updates based on content importance can optimize the model's performance by focusing on critical information. This approach can be particularly useful in autoregressive models where the order and importance of information can significantly impact performance[Analysis Note: Round 3].\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014hybrid architectures combining convolution and attention, efficient implementation strategies such as tiling and hierarchy, and performance optimization methods like adaptive feature extraction and hierarchical processing\u2014the researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/59 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nData Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pages 1-29, 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/ s10618-021-00745-9.

HiPPO The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory 24] and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) 58. The HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture. A successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT [12] keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations. First, the state matrix $A$ and discretization timescale $\\Delta t$ cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which $A$ matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations. Second, (1) is a 1-D to $N$-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D. This creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/20 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, January 2021.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nW.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

We introduce the Professor Forcing algorithm, which uses adversarial domain adaptation to encourage the dynamics of the recurrent network to be the same when training the network and when sampling from the network over multiple time steps. We apply Professor Forcing to language modeling, vocal synthesis on raw waveforms, handwriting generation, and image generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer, improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST. We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples, especially when sampling for a large number of time steps. This is supported by human evaluation of sample quality. Trade-offs between Professor Forcing and Scheduled Sampling are discussed. We produce T-SNEs showing that Professor Forcing successfully makes the dynamics of the network during training and sampling more similar.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 550  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 2. SparseProp: Efficient Event-Based Simulation and Training of Sparse Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training recurrent networks numerical stability*\n\n*Rainer Engelken*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired models that are capable of processing information in streams of action potentials. However, simulating and training SNNs is computationally expensive due to the need to solve large systems of coupled differential equations. In this paper, we introduce SparseProp, a novel event-based algorithm for simulating and training sparse SNNs. Our algorithm reduces the computational cost of both the forward and backward pass operations from O(N) to O(log(N)) per network spike, thereby enabling numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and their efficient training using backpropagation through time. By leveraging the sparsity of the network, SparseProp eliminates the need to iterate through all neurons at each spike, employing efficient state updates instead. We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseProp across several classical integrate-and-fire neuron models, including a simulation of a sparse SNN with one million LIF neurons. This results in a speed-up exceeding four orders of magnitude relative to previous event-based implementations. Our work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Durstewitz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proves three theorems on the mathematical equivalence between the discrete and continuous time formulations under a variety of conditions, and illustrates how to use the mathematical results on different machine learning and nonlinear dynamical systems examples.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNN) as used in machine learning are commonly formulated in discrete time, i.e. as recursive maps. This brings a lot of advantages for training models on data, e.g. for the purpose of time series prediction or dynamical systems identification, as powerful and efficient inference algorithms exist for discrete time systems and numerical integration of differential equations is not necessary. On the other hand, mathematical analysis of dynamical systems inferred from data is often more convenient and enables additional insights if these are formulated in continuous time, i.e. as systems of ordinary (or partial) differential equations (ODE). Here we show how to perform such a translation from discrete to continuous time for a particular class of ReLU-based RNN. We prove three theorems on the mathematical equivalence between the discrete and continuous time formulations under a variety of conditions, and illustrate how to use our mathematical results on different machine learning and nonlinear dynamical systems examples.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes RNN heuristics, temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations while addressing their shortcomings, and introduces a trainable subset of structured matrices that endow LSSLs with long-range memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 352  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 5.

FDPs require a new mathematical framework to describe the forward and backward dynamics, and several extensions to derive practical training objectives. These include infinite-dimensional versions of Girsanov theorem, in order to be able to compute an ELBO, and of the sampling theorem, in order to guarantee that functional evaluations in a countable set of points are equivalent to infinite-dimensional functions. We use FDPs to build a new breed of generative models in function spaces, which do not require specialized network architectures, and that can work with any kind of continuous data. Our results on real data show that FDPs achieve high-quality image generation, using a simple MLP architecture with orders of magnitude fewer parameters than existing diffusion models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. ContiFormer: Continuous-Time Transformer for Irregular Time Series Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time models recurrent architectures stability*\n\n*Yuqi Chen, Kan Ren, Yansen Wang, Yuchen Fang, Weiwei Sun, Dongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** ContiFormer is proposed that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling continuous-time dynamics on irregular time series is critical to account for data evolution and correlations that occur continuously. Traditional methods including recurrent neural networks or Transformer models leverage inductive bias via powerful neural architectures to capture complex patterns. However, due to their discrete characteristic, they have limitations in generalizing to continuous-time data paradigms. Though neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) and their variants have shown promising results in dealing with irregular time series, they often fail to capture the intricate correlations within these sequences. It is challenging yet demanding to concurrently model the relationship between input data points and capture the dynamic changes of the continuous-time system. To tackle this problem, we propose ContiFormer that extends the relation modeling of vanilla Transformer to the continuous-time domain, which explicitly incorporates the modeling abilities of continuous dynamics of Neural ODEs with the attention mechanism of Transformers. We mathematically characterize the expressive power of ContiFormer and illustrate that, by curated designs of function hypothesis, many Transformer variants specialized in irregular time series modeling can be covered as a special case of ContiFormer. A wide range of experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets have illustrated the superior modeling capacities and prediction performance of ContiFormer on irregular time series data.

A Systematic Exploration of Reservoir Computing for Forecasting Complex Spatiotemporal Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training recurrent networks numerical stability*\n\n*Henry D. I. Abarbanel, Tse-Chun Chen, Timothy A. Smith, Stephen G. Penny, Jason A. Platt*\n\n**Abstract:** A reservoir computer (RC) is a type of simplified recurrent neural network architecture that has demonstrated success in the prediction of spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems. A further advantage of RC is that it reproduces intrinsic dynamical quantities essential for its incorporation into numerical forecasting routines such as the ensemble Kalman filter -- used in numerical weather prediction to compensate for sparse and noisy data. We explore here the architecture and design choices for a \"best in class\" RC for a number of characteristic dynamical systems, and then show the application of these choices in scaling up to larger models using localization. Our analysis points to the importance of large scale parameter optimization. We also note in particular the importance of including input bias in the RC design, which has a significant impact on the forecast skill of the trained RC model. In our tests, the the use of a nonlinear readout operator does not affect the forecast time or the stability of the forecast. The effects of the reservoir dimension, spinup time, amount of training data, normalization, noise, and the RC time step are also investigated. While we are not aware of a generally accepted best reported mean forecast time for different models in the literature, we report over a factor of 2 increase in the mean forecast time compared to the best performing RC model of Vlachas et.al (2020) for the 40 dimensional spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz 1996 dynamics, and we are able to accomplish this using a smaller reservoir size.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time models recurrent architectures stability*\n\n*Liam Hodgkinson, Omri Azencot, N. Benjamin Erichson, Michael W. Mahoney, Alejandro Queiruga*\n\n**Abstract:** Viewing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as continuous-time dynamical systems, we propose a recurrent unit that describes the hidden state's evolution with two parts: a well-understood linear component plus a Lipschitz nonlinearity. This particular functional form facilitates stability analysis of the long-term behavior of the recurrent unit using tools from nonlinear systems theory. In turn, this enables architectural design decisions before experimentation. Sufficient conditions for global stability of the recurrent unit are obtained, motivating a novel scheme for constructing hidden-to-hidden matrices. Our experiments demonstrate that the Lipschitz RNN can outperform existing recurrent units on a range of benchmark tasks, including computer vision, language modeling and speech prediction tasks. Finally, through Hessian-based analysis we demonstrate that our Lipschitz recurrent unit is more robust with respect to input and parameter perturbations as compared to other continuous-time RNNs.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Behavior quantification as the missing link between fields: Tools for digital psychiatry and their role in the future of neurobiology\n\n*From Search Query: continuous-time models recurrent architectures stability*\n\n*Michaela Ennis*\n\n**Abstract:** The great behavioral heterogeneity observed between individuals with the same psychiatric disorder and even within one individual over time complicates both clinical practice and biomedical research. However, modern technologies are an exciting opportunity to improve behavioral characterization. Existing psychiatry methods that are qualitative or unscalable, such as patient surveys or clinical interviews, can now be collected at a greater capacity and analyzed to produce new quantitative measures. Furthermore, recent capabilities for continuous collection of passive sensor streams, such as phone GPS or smartwatch accelerometer, open avenues of novel questioning that were previously entirely unrealistic. Their temporally dense nature enables a cohesive study of real-time neural and behavioral signals. To develop comprehensive neurobiological models of psychiatric disease, it will be critical to first develop strong methods for behavioral quantification. There is huge potential in what can theoretically be captured by current technologies, but this in itself presents a large computational challenge -- one that will necessitate new data processing tools, new machine learning techniques, and ultimately a shift in how interdisciplinary work is conducted. In my thesis, I detail research projects that take different perspectives on digital psychiatry, subsequently tying ideas together with a concluding discussion on the future of the field. I also provide software infrastructure where relevant, with extensive documentation.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Test-Time Training with Self-Supervision for Generalization under Distribution Shifts\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Yu Sun, X. Wang, Zhuang Liu, John Miller, Alexei A.

TTT++: When Does Self-Supervised Test-Time Training Fail or Thrive?\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Yuejiang Liu, Parth Kothari, B. V. Delft, Baptiste Bellot-Gurlet, Taylor Mordan, Alexandre Alahi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing ofine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data is introduced, indicating that storing and exploiting extra information, in addition to model parameters, can be a promising direction towards robust test- time adaptation.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time training (TTT) through self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging paradigm to tackle distributional shifts. Despite encouraging results, it remains unclear when this approach thrives or fails. In this work, we \ufb01rst provide an in-depth look at its limitations and show that TTT can possibly deteriorate, instead of improving, the test-time performance in the presence of severe distribution shifts. To address this issue, we introduce a test-time feature alignment strategy utilizing of\ufb02ine feature summarization and online moment matching, which regularizes adaptation without revisiting training data. We further scale this strategy in the online setting through batch-queue decoupling to enable robust moment estimates even with limited batch size. Given aligned feature distributions, we then shed light on the strong potential of TTT by theoretically analyzing its performance post adaptation. This analysis motivates our use of more informative self-supervision in the form of contrastive learning for visual recognition problems. We empirically demonstrate that our modi\ufb01ed version of test-time training, termed TTT++ , outperforms state-of-the-art methods by signi\ufb01cant margins on several benchmarks. Our result indicates that storing and exploiting extra information, in addition to model parameters, can be a promising direction towards robust test-time adaptation.

A Matrix Chernoff Bound for Markov Chains and Its Application to Co-occurrence Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*J. Qiu, Chi Wang, Ben Liao, Richard Peng, Jie Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proves a Chernoff-type bound for sums of matrix-valued random variables sampled via a regular (aperiodic and irreducible) finite Markov chain and gives the first bound on the convergence rate of the co-occurrence matrix and the first sample complexity analysis in graph representation learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We prove a Chernoff-type bound for sums of matrix-valued random variables sampled via a regular (aperiodic and irreducible) finite Markov chain. Specially, consider a random walk on a regular Markov chain and a Hermitian matrix-valued function on its state space. Our result gives exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of the extreme eigenvalues of the sample mean matrix. Our proof is based on the matrix expander (regular undirected graph) Chernoff bound [Garg et al. STOC \u201918] and scalar Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for Markov chains [Chung et al. STACS \u201912]. Our matrix Chernoff bound for Markov chains can be applied to analyze the behavior of co-occurrence statistics for sequential data, which have been common and important data signals in machine learning. We show that given a regular Markov chain with \\(n\\) states and mixing time \\(\\tau\\), we need a trajectory of length \\(O(\\tau (\\log{n} + \\log{\\tau})/\\epsilon^2)\\) to achieve an estimator of the co-occurrence matrix with error bound \\(\\epsilon\\). We conduct several experiments and the experimental results are consistent with the exponentially fast convergence rate from theoretical analysis. Our result gives the first bound on the convergence rate of the co-occurrence matrix and the first sample complexity analysis in graph representation learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Continuous-Time Markov Chain Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*Monir Hajiaghayi, Bonnie Kirkpatrick, Liangliang Wang, A. Bouchard-C\u00f4t\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding times are marginalized analytically and shows that in a range of realistic inferential setups, this scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given a fixed computational budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Many problems of practical interest rely on Continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) defined over combinatorial state spaces, rendering the computation of transition probabilities, and hence probabilistic inference, difficult or impossible with existing methods. For problems with countably infinite states, where classical methods such as matrix exponentiation are not applicable, the main alternative has been particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods imputing both the holding times and sequences of visited states. We propose a particle-based Monte Carlo approach where the holding times are marginalized analytically. We demonstrate that in a range of realistic inferential setups, our scheme dramatically reduces the variance of the Monte Carlo approximation and yields more accurate parameter posterior approximations given a fixed computational budget. These experiments are performed on both synthetic and real datasets, drawing from two important examples of CTMCs having combinatorial state spaces: string-valued mutation models in phylogenetics and nucleic acid folding pathways.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient linear attention*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient linear attention*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Introducing Intermediate Domains for Effective Self-Training during Test-Time\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Bin Yang, Mario D\u00f6bler, Robert A. Marsden*\n\n**Abstract:** Experiencing domain shifts during test-time is nearly inevitable in practice and likely results in a severe performance degradation. To overcome this issue, test-time adaptation continues to update the initial source model during deployment. A promising direction are methods based on self-training which have been shown to be well suited for gradual domain adaptation, since reliable pseudo-labels can be provided. In this work, we address two problems that exist when applying self-training in the setting of test-time adaptation. First, adapting a model to long test sequences that contain multiple domains can lead to error accumulation. Second, naturally, not all shifts are gradual in practice. To tackle these challenges, we introduce GTTA. By creating artificial intermediate domains that divide the current domain shift into a more gradual one, effective self-training through high quality pseudo-labels can be performed. To create the intermediate domains, we propose two independent variations: mixup and light-weight style transfer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the continual and gradual corruption benchmarks, as well as ImageNet-R. To further investigate gradual shifts in the context of urban scene segmentation, we publish a new benchmark: CarlaTTA. It enables the exploration of several non-stationary domain shifts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training*\n\n*Carlos Guestrin, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Sanmi Koyejo, Xiaolong Wang, Xinlei Chen, Yann Dubois, Genghan Zhang, Arjun Vikram, Jiarui Xu, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li, Yu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Towards Faster Training of Global Covariance Pooling Networks by Iterative Matrix Square Root Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: matrix-valued states*\n\n*Zilin Gao, Peihua Li, Jiangtao Xie, Qilong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Global covariance pooling in convolutional neural networks has achieved\nimpressive improvement over the classical first-order pooling. Recent works\nhave shown matrix square root normalization plays a central role in achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods depend heavily on\neigendecomposition (EIG) or singular value decomposition (SVD), suffering from\ninefficient training due to limited support of EIG and SVD on GPU. Towards\naddressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root\nnormalization method for fast end-to-end training of global covariance pooling\nnetworks. At the core of our method is a meta-layer designed with loop-embedded\ndirected graph structure. The meta-layer consists of three consecutive\nnonlinear structured layers, which perform pre-normalization, coupled matrix\niteration and post-compensation, respectively. Our method is much faster than\nEIG or SVD based ones, since it involves only matrix multiplications, suitable\nfor parallel implementation on GPU. Moreover, the proposed network with ResNet\narchitecture can converge in much less epochs, further accelerating network\ntraining. On large-scale ImageNet, we achieve competitive performance superior\nto existing counterparts. By finetuning our models pre-trained on ImageNet, we\nestablish state-of-the-art results on three challenging fine-grained\nbenchmarks.

EfficientViT: Multi-Scale Linear Attention for High-Resolution Dense Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient linear attention*\n\n*Chuang Gan, Junyan Li, Muyan Hu, Song Han, Han Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** High-resolution dense prediction enables many appealing real-world applications, such as computational photography, autonomous driving, etc. However, the vast computational cost makes deploying state-of-the-art high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices difficult. This work presents EfficientViT, a new family of high-resolution vision models with novel multi-scale linear attention. Unlike prior high-resolution dense prediction models that rely on heavy softmax attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topology structure to obtain good performances, our multi-scale linear attention achieves the global receptive field and multi-scale learning (two desirable features for high-resolution dense prediction) with only lightweight and hardware-efficient operations. As such, EfficientViT delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art models with significant speedup on diverse hardware platforms, including mobile CPU, edge GPU, and cloud GPU. Without performance loss on Cityscapes, our EfficientViT provides up to 13.9$\\times$ and 6.2$\\times$ GPU latency reduction over SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively. For super-resolution, EfficientViT delivers up to 6.4x speedup over Restormer while providing 0.11dB gain in PSNR. For Segment Anything, EfficientViT delivers 48.9x higher throughput on A100 GPU while achieving slightly better zero-shot instance segmentation performance on COCO.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and evaluating the **HybridTTTRWKV** architecture, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Feasibility of Combining Test-Time Training with Matrix-Valued States\n\n- The concept of combining test-time training with matrix-valued states is novel and requires verification of its feasibility.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.41)*\n\n```\nW.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

We introduce the Professor Forcing algorithm, which uses adversarial domain adaptation to encourage the dynamics of the recurrent network to be the same when training the network and when sampling from the network over multiple time steps. We apply Professor Forcing to language modeling, vocal synthesis on raw waveforms, handwriting generation, and image generation. Empirically we find that Professor Forcing acts as a regularizer, improving test likelihood on character level Penn Treebank and sequential MNIST. We also find that the model qualitatively improves samples, especially when sampling for a large number of time steps. This is supported by human evaluation of sample quality. Trade-offs between Professor Forcing and Scheduled Sampling are discussed. We produce T-SNEs showing that Professor Forcing successfully makes the dynamics of the network during training and sampling more similar.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 550  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 2. Test-Time Adaptation via Conjugate Pseudo-labels\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation recurrent networks*\n\n*Sachin Goyal, Mingjie Sun, Aditi Raghunathan, Zico Kolter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic recipe is presented that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class, and can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which is referred to as the conjugate pseudolabel.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting neural networks to distribution shifts, with access to only the unlabeled test samples from the new domain at test-time. Prior TTA methods optimize over unsupervised objectives such as the entropy of model predictions in TENT [Wang et al., 2021], but it is unclear what exactly makes a good TTA loss. In this paper, we start by presenting a surprising phenomenon: if we attempt to meta-learn the best possible TTA loss over a wide class of functions, then we recover a function that is remarkably similar to (a temperature-scaled version of) the softmax-entropy employed by TENT. This only holds, however, if the classifier we are adapting is trained via cross-entropy; if trained via squared loss, a different best TTA loss emerges. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze TTA through the lens of the training losses's convex conjugate. We show that under natural conditions, this (unsupervised) conjugate function can be viewed as a good local approximation to the original supervised loss and indeed, it recovers the best losses found by meta-learning. This leads to a generic recipe that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class. Empirically, our approach consistently dominates other baselines over a wide range of benchmarks. Our approach is particularly of interest when applied to classifiers trained with novel loss functions, e.g., the recently-proposed PolyLoss, where it differs substantially from (and outperforms) an entropy-based loss. Further, we show that our approach can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which we refer to as the conjugate pseudolabel. Overall, our method provides a broad framework for better understanding and improving test-time adaptation.

The primary challenge of TTA is limited access to the entire test dataset during online updates, causing error accumulation. To mitigate it, TTA methods have utilized the model output's entropy as a confidence metric that aims to determine which samples have a lower likelihood of causing error. Through experimental studies, however, we observed the unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric for TTA under biased scenarios and theoretically revealed that it stems from the neglect of the influence of latent disentangled factors of data on predictions. Building upon these findings, we introduce a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). PLPD quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation. DeYO consists of sample selection and sample weighting, which employ entropy and PLPD concurrently. For robust adaptation, DeYO prioritizes samples that dominantly incorporate shape information when making predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of DeYO over baseline methods across various scenarios, including biased and wild.

This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection. By leveraging a combination of graph neural networks and recurrent structures, REST efficiently captures both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies within EEG data. Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task. These attributes position REST as a promising candidate for real-time implementation in clinical devices, such as Responsive Neurostimulation or seizure alert systems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph. This model can also be encouraged to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model on various tasks and show how it can reduce the number of required RNN updates while preserving, and sometimes even improving, the performance of the baseline RNN models.

Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention.

Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation recurrent networks*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Attending to Mathematical Language with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation recurrent networks*\n\n*Artit Wangperawong*\n\n**Abstract:** Mathematical expressions were generated, evaluated and used to train neural network models based on the transformer architecture. The expressions and their targets were analyzed as a character-level sequence transduction task in which the encoder and decoder are built on attention mechanisms. Three models were trained to understand and evaluate symbolic variables and expressions in mathematics: (1) the self-attentive and feed-forward transformer without recurrence or convolution, (2) the universal transformer with recurrence, and (3) the adaptive universal transformer with recurrence and adaptive computation time. The models respectively achieved test accuracies as high as 76.1%, 78.8% and 84.9% in evaluating the expressions to match the target values. For the cases inferred incorrectly, the results differed from the targets by only one or two characters. The models notably learned to add, subtract and multiply both positive and negative decimal numbers of variable digits assigned to symbolic variables.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. Killing Two Birds with One Stone:Efficient and Robust Training of Face Recognition CNNs by Partial FC\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates*\n\n*Tongliang Liu, Jing Yang, Xuhan Zhu, Ziyong Feng, Jia Guo, Jiankang Deng, Xiang An*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning discriminative deep feature embeddings by using million-scale in-the-wild datasets and margin-based softmax loss is the current state-of-the-art approach for face recognition. However, the memory and computing cost of the Fully Connected (FC) layer linearly scales up to the number of identities in the training set. Besides, the large-scale training data inevitably suffers from inter-class conflict and long-tailed distribution. In this paper, we propose a sparsely updating variant of the FC layer, named Partial FC (PFC). In each iteration, positive class centers and a random subset of negative class centers are selected to compute the margin-based softmax loss. All class centers are still maintained throughout the whole training process, but only a subset is selected and updated in each iteration. Therefore, the computing requirement, the probability of inter-class conflict, and the frequency of passive update on tail class centers, are dramatically reduced. Extensive experiments across different training data and backbones (e.g. CNN and ViT) confirm the effectiveness, robustness and efficiency of the proposed PFC.

Distributed Prioritized Experience Replay\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates*\n\n*Gabriel Barth-Maron, David Budden, Hado van Hasselt, Dan Horgan, Matteo Hessel, David Silver, John Quan*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a distributed architecture for deep reinforcement learning at\nscale, that enables agents to learn effectively from orders of magnitude more\ndata than previously possible. The algorithm decouples acting from learning:\nthe actors interact with their own instances of the environment by selecting\nactions according to a shared neural network, and accumulate the resulting\nexperience in a shared experience replay memory; the learner replays samples of\nexperience and updates the neural network. The architecture relies on\nprioritized experience replay to focus only on the most significant data\ngenerated by the actors. Our architecture substantially improves the state of\nthe art on the Arcade Learning Environment, achieving better final performance\nin a fraction of the wall-clock training time.\n\n**Conference:** distributed-prioritized-experience-replay-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-02\n\n\n\n#### 5. Euler State Networks: Non-dissipative Reservoir Computing\n\n*From Search Query: numerical stability in dynamic recurrence*\n\n*Claudio Gallicchio*\n\n**Abstract:** Inspired by the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations, in this paper we propose a novel Reservoir Computing (RC) model, called the Euler State Network (EuSN). The presented approach makes use of forward Euler discretization and antisymmetric recurrent matrices to design reservoir dynamics that are both stable and non-dissipative by construction. Our mathematical analysis shows that the resulting model is biased towards a unitary effective spectral radius and zero local Lyapunov exponents, intrinsically operating near to the edge of stability. Experiments on long-term memory tasks show the clear superiority of the proposed approach over standard RC models in problems requiring effective propagation of input information over multiple time-steps. Furthermore, results on time-series classification benchmarks indicate that EuSN is able to match (or even exceed) the accuracy of trainable Recurrent Neural Networks, while retaining the training efficiency of the RC family, resulting in up to $\\approx$ 490-fold savings in computation time and $\\approx$ 1750-fold savings in energy consumption.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. A Systematic Exploration of Reservoir Computing for Forecasting Complex Spatiotemporal Dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: numerical stability in dynamic recurrence*\n\n*Henry D. I. Abarbanel, Tse-Chun Chen, Timothy A. Smith, Stephen G. Penny, Jason A. Platt*\n\n**Abstract:** A reservoir computer (RC) is a type of simplified recurrent neural network architecture that has demonstrated success in the prediction of spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical systems. A further advantage of RC is that it reproduces intrinsic dynamical quantities essential for its incorporation into numerical forecasting routines such as the ensemble Kalman filter -- used in numerical weather prediction to compensate for sparse and noisy data. We explore here the architecture and design choices for a \"best in class\" RC for a number of characteristic dynamical systems, and then show the application of these choices in scaling up to larger models using localization. Our analysis points to the importance of large scale parameter optimization. We also note in particular the importance of including input bias in the RC design, which has a significant impact on the forecast skill of the trained RC model. In our tests, the the use of a nonlinear readout operator does not affect the forecast time or the stability of the forecast. The effects of the reservoir dimension, spinup time, amount of training data, normalization, noise, and the RC time step are also investigated. While we are not aware of a generally accepted best reported mean forecast time for different models in the literature, we report over a factor of 2 increase in the mean forecast time compared to the best performing RC model of Vlachas et.al (2020) for the 40 dimensional spatiotemporally chaotic Lorenz 1996 dynamics, and we are able to accomplish this using a smaller reservoir size.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the proposed **HybridTTTRWKV**, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Feasibility of Combining Test-Time Training with Recurrent Architectures\n\n- The work by Carlos Guestrin et al.

This integration is feasible and could enhance model adaptability and expressivity.\n\n## Efficiency and Expressivity of Matrix-Valued States\n\n- The RWKV architecture, as described by Bo Peng et al. (2024), uses matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence mechanisms. This approach improves expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency, which is crucial for handling long sequences. Combining this with test-time training could be highly beneficial.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Works such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) Transformers by Songlin Yang et al. (2023) and Lightning Attention by Zhen Qin et al. (2024) demonstrate competitive performance with standard Transformers while being more hardware-efficient. These mechanisms can be integrated into the HybridTTTRWKV to maintain efficiency across varying sequence lengths.\n\n## Numerical Stability and State Management\n\n- Ensuring numerical stability in models that combine recurrent states with adaptation mechanisms is critical. The use of RMSNorm layers, as discussed in the Falcon Mamba model (2024), can help stabilize training loss and prevent state explosion or decay. This is particularly relevant when dealing with dynamic recurrence and test-time adaptation.\n\n## Alignment with Current Research Trends\n\n- The proposal aligns with ongoing research trends focused on improving generalization under distribution shifts and enhancing long-sequence processing efficiency. Integrating test-time training with efficient sequential architectures is a current area of interest, as seen in works like Yu Sun et al. (2019) and Yossi Gandelsman et al. (2022).\n\n## Novelty and Unique Contributions\n\n- The specific combination of test-time training with matrix-valued states and hardware-efficient linear attention in a unified architecture appears novel. The proposal's unique contributions include:\n  - Merging test-time adaptation with efficient recurrent mechanisms.\n  - Introducing selective state updates based on content importance within a matrix-valued state framework.\n  - Implementing multi-scale convolutions alongside hardware-efficient linear attention to capture features at different temporal scales.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n- Investigate papers discussing practical implementation issues when integrating test-time training with recurrent architectures. For example, the Falcon Mamba model highlights the importance of careful model initializations and learning rate management to address stability issues during training.\n\n### Empirical Evaluations of Similar Architectures\n\n- Look for empirical results comparing models that combine elements from RWKV, TTT, and hardware-efficient attention. For instance, the MatMamba model, which combines state space models with matryoshka-style learning, shows promising results in terms of performance and efficiency, and could provide insights into the potential benefits and limitations of similar architectures.\n\n### Advancements in Dynamic Recurrence Mechanisms\n\n- Investigate recent developments in dynamic recurrence and state management, such as the improvements in RWKV and MatMamba models. These works provide insights into how to effectively integrate dynamic recurrence with test-time training.\n\n### Analysis of Selective State Updates\n\n- Search for research on selective or content-based state updates in recurrent models. This could involve looking into how models like the MatFormer, which uses matryoshka packing to adaptively extract submodels, handle state updates and maintain performance.\n\n## Relevant Sources\n\n- **MatMamba State Space Model**: This work introduces a nested Matryoshka structure on a Mamba2 state space model, which brings together the best of both Mamba-style models and Matryoshka-style learning. It provides insights into adaptive inference and the use of multiple granularities, which could be relevant for the HybridTTTRWKV proposal.\n\n- **Falcon Mamba Model**: This model, which is an attention-free language model, highlights the importance of careful learning rate management and model initialization to ensure stability during training. It also discusses the use of RMSNorm layers to stabilize the model.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to refine the HybridTTTRWKV proposal, address potential challenges, and articulate its unique contributions to the field of language modeling.\n",

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nW.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification.

Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/59 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nData Mining and Knowledge Discovery, pages 1-29, 2021. doi: https://doi.org/10.1007/ s10618-021-00745-9.

HiPPO The LSSL is most closely related to the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memory 24] and its predecessor, the Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) 58. The HiPPO-RNN and the LMU define dynamics of the form of equation (1), and incorporate it into an RNN architecture. A successor to the LMU, the LMU-FFT [12] keeps the original linear dynamics, allowing the LMU to be computed with a cached convolution kernel. These methods all suffer from two main limitations. First, the state matrix $A$ and discretization timescale $\\Delta t$ cannot be trained due to both limitations in theoretical understanding of which $A$ matrices are effective, as well as computational limitations. Second, (1) is a 1-D to $N$-D map, requiring states to be projected back down to 1-D. This creates an overall 1-D bottleneck in the state, limiting the expressivity of the model. Compared to these, the LSSL does not use a conventional RNN architecture, instead keeping the linear recurrence (4) and downprojecting it with the second part of the state space representation (5).\n```\n\n#### 4.

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/45 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nHambly, B. and Lyons, T.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent networks test-time adaptation stability*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 2. Test-Time Adaptation via Conjugate Pseudo-labels\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent networks test-time adaptation stability*\n\n*Sachin Goyal, Mingjie Sun, Aditi Raghunathan, Zico Kolter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic recipe is presented that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class, and can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which is referred to as the conjugate pseudolabel.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) refers to adapting neural networks to distribution shifts, with access to only the unlabeled test samples from the new domain at test-time. Prior TTA methods optimize over unsupervised objectives such as the entropy of model predictions in TENT [Wang et al., 2021], but it is unclear what exactly makes a good TTA loss. In this paper, we start by presenting a surprising phenomenon: if we attempt to meta-learn the best possible TTA loss over a wide class of functions, then we recover a function that is remarkably similar to (a temperature-scaled version of) the softmax-entropy employed by TENT. This only holds, however, if the classifier we are adapting is trained via cross-entropy; if trained via squared loss, a different best TTA loss emerges. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze TTA through the lens of the training losses's convex conjugate. We show that under natural conditions, this (unsupervised) conjugate function can be viewed as a good local approximation to the original supervised loss and indeed, it recovers the best losses found by meta-learning. This leads to a generic recipe that can be used to find a good TTA loss for any given supervised training loss function of a general class. Empirically, our approach consistently dominates other baselines over a wide range of benchmarks. Our approach is particularly of interest when applied to classifiers trained with novel loss functions, e.g., the recently-proposed PolyLoss, where it differs substantially from (and outperforms) an entropy-based loss. Further, we show that our approach can also be interpreted as a kind of self-training using a very specific soft label, which we refer to as the conjugate pseudolabel. Overall, our method provides a broad framework for better understanding and improving test-time adaptation.

Entropy is not Enough for Test-Time Adaptation: From the Perspective of Disentangled Factors\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent networks test-time adaptation stability*\n\n*Jonghyun Lee, Dahuin Jung, Saehyung Lee, Junsung Park, Juhyeon Shin, Uiwon Hwang, Sungroh Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD), which quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) fine-tunes pre-trained deep neural networks for unseen test data. The primary challenge of TTA is limited access to the entire test dataset during online updates, causing error accumulation. To mitigate it, TTA methods have utilized the model output's entropy as a confidence metric that aims to determine which samples have a lower likelihood of causing error. Through experimental studies, however, we observed the unreliability of entropy as a confidence metric for TTA under biased scenarios and theoretically revealed that it stems from the neglect of the influence of latent disentangled factors of data on predictions. Building upon these findings, we introduce a novel TTA method named Destroy Your Object (DeYO), which leverages a newly proposed confidence metric named Pseudo-Label Probability Difference (PLPD). PLPD quantifies the influence of the shape of an object on prediction by measuring the difference between predictions before and after applying an object-destructive transformation. DeYO consists of sample selection and sample weighting, which employ entropy and PLPD concurrently. For robust adaptation, DeYO prioritizes samples that dominantly incorporate shape information when making predictions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of DeYO over baseline methods across various scenarios, including biased and wild.

Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic recurrence numerical stability techniques*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, training RNNs on long sequences often face challenges like slow inference, vanishing gradients and difficulty in capturing long term dependencies. In backpropagation through time settings, these issues are tightly coupled with the large, sequential computational graph resulting from unfolding the RNN in time. We introduce the Skip RNN model which extends existing RNN models by learning to skip state updates and shortens the effective size of the computational graph. This model can also be encouraged to perform fewer state updates through a budget constraint. We evaluate the proposed model on various tasks and show how it can reduce the number of required RNN updates while preserving, and sometimes even improving, the performance of the baseline RNN models.

This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure detection. By leveraging a combination of graph neural networks and recurrent structures, REST efficiently captures both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies within EEG data. Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task. These attributes position REST as a promising candidate for real-time implementation in clinical devices, such as Responsive Neurostimulation or seizure alert systems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. The Wasserstein Believer: Learning Belief Updates for Partially Observable Environments through Reliable Latent Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates recurrent models*\n\n*Raphael Avalos, Florent Delgrange, Ann Now'e, Guillermo A. P'erez, D. Roijers*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Wasserstein Belief Updater, an RL algorithm that learns a latent model of the POMDP and an approximation of the belief update, with theoretical guarantees on the quality of the approximation ensuring that the outputted beliefs allow for learning the optimal value function.\n\n**Abstract:** Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are used to model environments where the full state cannot be perceived by an agent. As such the agent needs to reason taking into account the past observations and actions. However, simply remembering the full history is generally intractable due to the exponential growth in the history space. Maintaining a probability distribution that models the belief over what the true state is can be used as a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to the model of the environment and is often intractable. While SOTA algorithms use Recurrent Neural Networks to compress the observation-action history aiming to learn a sufficient statistic, they lack guarantees of success and can lead to sub-optimal policies. To overcome this, we propose the Wasserstein Belief Updater, an RL algorithm that learns a latent model of the POMDP and an approximation of the belief update. Our approach comes with theoretical guarantees on the quality of our approximation ensuring that our outputted beliefs allow for learning the optimal value function.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent networks test-time adaptation stability*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Bifurcations and loss jumps in RNN training\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic recurrence numerical stability techniques*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are popular machine learning tools for modeling and forecasting sequential data and for inferring dynamical systems (DS) from observed time series. Concepts from DS theory (DST) have variously been used to further our understanding of both, how trained RNNs solve complex tasks, and the training process itself. Bifurcations are particularly important phenomena in DS, including RNNs, that refer to topological (qualitative) changes in a system's dynamical behavior as one or more of its parameters are varied. Knowing the bifurcation structure of an RNN will thus allow to deduce many of its computational and dynamical properties, like its sensitivity to parameter variations or its behavior during training. In particular, bifurcations may account for sudden loss jumps observed in RNN training that could severely impede the training process. Here we first mathematically prove for a particular class of ReLU-based RNNs that certain bifurcations are indeed associated with loss gradients tending toward infinity or zero. We then introduce a novel heuristic algorithm for detecting all fixed points and $k$-cycles in ReLU-based RNNs and their existence and stability regions, hence bifurcation manifolds in parameter space. In contrast to previous numerical algorithms for finding fixed points and common continuation methods, our algorithm provides $\\textit{exact}$ results and returns fixed points and cycles up to high orders with surprisingly good scaling behavior. We exemplify the algorithm on the analysis of the training process of RNNs, and find that the recently introduced technique of generalized teacher forcing completely avoids certain types of bifurcations in training. Thus, besides facilitating the DST analysis of trained RNNs, our algorithm provides a powerful instrument for analyzing the training process itself.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Spiking mode-based neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates recurrent models*\n\n*Haiping Huang, Zhanghan Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks play an important role in brain-like neuromorphic computations and in studying working mechanisms of neural circuits. One drawback of training a large scale spiking neural network is that updating all weights is quite expensive. Furthermore, after training, all information related to the computational task is hidden into the weight matrix, prohibiting us from a transparent understanding of circuit mechanisms. Therefore, in this work, we address these challenges by proposing a spiking mode-based training protocol, where the recurrent weight matrix is explained as a Hopfield-like multiplication of three matrices: input, output modes and a score matrix. The first advantage is that the weight is interpreted by input and output modes and their associated scores characterizing the importance of each decomposition term. The number of modes is thus adjustable, allowing more degrees of freedom for modeling the experimental data. This significantly reduces the training cost because of significantly reduced space complexity for learning. Training spiking networks is thus carried out in the mode-score space. The second advantage is that one can project the high dimensional neural activity (filtered spike train) in the state space onto the mode space which is typically of a low dimension, e.g., a few modes are sufficient to capture the shape of the underlying neural manifolds. We successfully apply our framework in two computational tasks -- digit classification and selective sensory integration tasks. Our method accelerate the training of spiking neural networks by a Hopfield-like decomposition, and moreover this training leads to low-dimensional attractor structures of high-dimensional neural dynamics.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Assessment of unsteady flow predictions using hybrid deep learning based reduced order models\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates recurrent models*\n\n*Rajeev Kumar Jaiman, Allan Ross Magee, Rachit Gupta, Sandeep Reddy Bukka*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present two deep learning-based hybrid data-driven reduced order models for the prediction of unsteady fluid flows. The first model projects the high-fidelity time series data from a finite element Navier-Stokes solver to a low-dimensional subspace via proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). The time-dependent coefficients in the POD subspace are propagated by the recurrent net (closed-loop encoder-decoder updates) and mapped to a high-dimensional state via the mean flow field and POD basis vectors. This model is referred as POD-RNN. The second model, referred to as convolution recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN), employs convolutional neural networks (CNN) as layers of linear kernels with nonlinear activations, to extract low-dimensional features from flow field snapshots. The flattened features are advanced using a recurrent (closed-loop manner) net and up-sampled (transpose convoluted) gradually to high-dimensional snapshots. Two benchmark problems of the flow past a cylinder and flow past a side-by-side cylinder are selected as the test problems to assess the efficacy of these models. For the problem of flow past a single cylinder, the performance of both the models is satisfactory, with CRAN being a bit overkill. However, it completely outperforms the POD-RNN model for a more complicated problem of flow past side-by-side cylinders. Owing to the scalability of CRAN, we briefly introduce an observer-corrector method for the calculation of integrated pressure force coefficients on the fluid-solid boundary on a reference grid. This reference grid, typically a structured and uniform grid, is used to interpolate scattered high-dimensional field data as snapshot images. These input images are convenient in training CRAN. This motivates us to further explore the application of CRAN models for the prediction of fluid flows.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the **HybridTTTRWKV** proposal, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Numerical Stability in Dynamic Recurrence\n\n- The researcher is concerned about maintaining numerical stability when combining test-time training (TTT) with dynamic recurrence and matrix-valued states.
