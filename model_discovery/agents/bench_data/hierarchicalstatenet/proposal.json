Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, we found that these tricks are not necessary. For example, the learned transforms in Section 4.1 typically put weight at least 0.99 on a permutation. Initialization As the BP or BPBP construction is a product of many matrices, proper initialization is crucial to avoid exponential blowup in the size of the entries or condition numbers (i.e., the exploding/vanishing gradient problem [37]). We aim to initialize each butterfly factor to be close to unitary or orthogonal, so that the magnitude of the inputs and outputs to the transform are preserved. This is easy since each of the factors $B_{N}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ has exactly two nonzeros in each row and column; for example in the real case, initializing each entry of $B_{k}$ as $\\mathcal{N}(0,1 / 2)$ guarantees $\\mathbb{E} B_{k}^{*} B_{k}=I_{N}$. Comparison to related methods Some previous works have examined similar butterfly matrices in numerical algebra or machine learning [36, 20, 32, mainly motivated by trying to parametrize cheap orthogonal matrices. Our parametrization, motivated by the goal of learning recursive transforms, differs in several ways from all previous works: 1 . We explicitly model and learn a permutation matrix $P$. 2. Our relaxation does not enforce the matrix to be orthogonal. 3. Our butterfly factors are ordered so that closer elements interact first (Figure 1), whereas some works (e.g. [32]) reverse the order. 4. Every work has a different weight-tying scheme; ours ties the blocks in each butterfly factor, leading to fewer parameters and a tighter recursive interpretation than for example [20]. Our main baseline for deep learning experiments is Thomas et al. 42, who define a special matrix class with a complicated recursive algorithm. While our BP method and theirs share some overlap (e.g., they both capture circulant matrices), they have a distinct parametrization, and the exact relation between the BP hierarchy and their LDR-SD or LDR-TD classes is unknown. From a practical standpoint, BP is significantly faster and simpler to implement than their methods. ### 3.3 Expressivity and the butterfly hierarchy\n\nThe butterfly matrix $B$ has a total of $4 N$ learnable parameters (the butterfly factors $B_{N}, B_{N / 2}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ have $2 N, N, \\ldots, 4$ entries respectively). The overall permutation $P$ has $3 \\log _{2} N$ learnable parameters; we can also tie the logits of the $\\log _{2} N$ probabilistic permutations-reflecting the fact that for some algorithms the reduction from size $N$ to $N / 2$ is self-similar to the reduction from size $N / 2^{k}$ to $N / 2^{k+1}$ reducing this to just 3 parameters. We can define a natural hierarchy of matrix classes built on the BP primitive. This hierarchy covers a spectrum ranging from extremely structured matrices with a linear number of parameters, to the entire space of square matrices. Definition 1. For any dimension $N$, let $(\\mathrm{BP})_{r}^{k}(k, r \\in \\mathbb{N})$ denote the classes of matrices that can be expressed as\n\n$$\nS\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{k} B_{i} P_{i}\\right) S^{T}\n$$\n\nwhere each $B_{i} P_{i} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{r N \\times r N}$ is a BP module as in equation (2), and $S \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N \\times r N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}I_{N} & 0 & \\ldots & 0\\end{array}\\right]$ (that is, $S$ and $S^{T}$ select the upper left $N \\times N$ entries of the BP product matrix). The subscript $r$ is understood to be 1 if omitted. Note that the BP and BPBP classes are equivalent to (BP) ${ }^{1}$ and (BP) ${ }^{2}$ respectively. We remark that $B$ and $P$ are both capable of being the identity, and thus $(\\mathrm{BP})^{k} \\subseteq(\\mathrm{BP})^{k+1}$. The BP hierarchy is expressive enough to theoretically represent many important transforms with low depth, as well as all matrices with linear depth:\n\nProposition 1. $(B P)^{1}$ captures the fast Fourier transform, the fast Hadamard transform, and their inverses exactly. $(B P)^{2}$ captures the DCT, DST, and convolution exactly. All $N \\times N$ matrices are contained in $(B P)_{2}^{4 N+10}$. Proposition 1 is shown in Appendix B. We suggest some additional conjectures about the expressiveness of the BP hierarchy in Appendix D. Even though the BP parameterization is expressive, it still retains the learnability characteristic of compressed parameterizations. In fact, neural networks comprising layers of BP and BPBP matrices still have VC dimension that is almost linear in the number of parameters (Appendix B), similar to networks with fully-connected layers [1, 17] and LDR 42, which implies a corresponding sample complexity bound. ## 4 Empirical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the proposed approach to verify that our butterfly parameterization can both recover fast transforms and be integrated as an effective component in ML pipelines ${ }^{3}$, In Section 4.1, we confirm that it automatically learns the fast algorithms for many discrete transforms commonly used in signal processing and machine learning. Section 4.2 further shows that it can be a useful component to increase the performance of deep learning models while ensuring fast multiplication and few parameters by design. ### 4.1 Discrete Transforms\n\nBelow we list several important classes of structured matrices. Some of them are directly captured by our parametrization and we expect that they can be recovered close to perfectly, thus providing a $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm that closely approximates the naive $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ matrix multiplication. Others are not perfectly captured by the BPBP class but still have recursive structure; for these, we expect that our method reconstructs them better than standard matrix compression methods (sparse, low-rank, and combinations) can. Transforms We describe the matrices we evaluate on and their applications; a standard reference is Proakis 38.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/35 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAll of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform.

To date, these transformations rely on carefully designed algorithms, such as the famous fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, and on specialized implementations (e.g., FFTW and cuFFT). Moreover, each specific transform requires hand-crafted implementations for every platform (e.g., Tensorflow and PyTorch lack the fast Hadamard transform), and it can be difficult to know when they are useful. Ideally, these barriers would be addressed by automatically learning the most effective transform for a given task and dataset, along with an efficient implementation of it. Such a method should be capable of recovering a range of fast transforms with high accuracy and realistic sizes given limited prior knowledge. It is also preferably composed of differentiable primitives and basic operations common to linear algebra/machine learning libraries, that allow it to run on any platform and be integrated into modern ML frameworks such as PyTorch/Tensorflow. More fundamentally, this problem ties into the foundational question of understanding the minimal prior knowledge needed to learn high-speed systems, in the spirit of modern trends toward relaxing manually imposed structure (i.e., AutoML). Recent progress in this vein of learning computational primitives includes addition/multiplication gates [43], the Strassen $2 \\times 2$ matrix multiplication algorithm [44, and PDE solvers [19]. We propose a method that addresses this problem for a class of important transforms that includes the\naforementioned examples. A key challenge lies in defining or parameterizing the space of transforms and corresponding fast algorithms, which requires using a minimal amount of prior knowledge that captures important and interesting transforms while remaining learnable and efficient. Egner \\& P\u00fcschel [13, 14] previously posed this question and a novel combinatorial approach, but their solution only addresses a limited set of transforms (primarily DFT) and only on limited problem sizes. In particular, these approaches search through an exponentially large discrete space using a symbolic form of the matrix [13, 14] and recover the solution only up to dimensions $8 \\times 8$. We instead draw two key lessons from the work of De Sa et al. 8, who characterize matrices with efficient matrix-vector multiplication algorithms as being factorizable into products of sparse matrices ${ }^{1}$ Thus, the task of learning algorithms can be reduced to finding appropriate sparse matrix product representations of the transforms. They further show that divide-and-conquer schemes lead to fast multiplication algorithms for a surprisingly general set of structured matrices. Motivated by the broad applicability of this recursive structure, we propose a particular factorization using sequences of special block diagonal matrices, called butterfly matrices. Specific instances of butterfly structure have been used before - for example as a random orthogonal preconditioner [36] or in matrix approximation [28 - but we use a relaxed representation that captures a larger class of structures and can learn from data. These form a class of structured matrices with $O(N)$ parameters and automatic fast multiplication in $O(N \\log N)$ operations. We empirically validate our method in two ways. First, we consider a specification of a transform (e.g., $N$ input-output pairs) and attempt to factorize it. We successfully recover a fast algorithm up to machine precision for several important transforms such as the DFT, Hadamard, DCT, and convolution for realistic sizes (dimensions up to $N=1024$ ), while standard sparse and low-rank baselines cannot (Section 4.1). Beyond recovering famous transforms, we additionally incorporate this method in end-to-end ML pipelines to learn fast and compressible latent transformations (Section 4.2). On the benchmark single hidden layer network, this parameterization exceeds the classification accuracy of a baseline fully connected layer on several datasets - such as by 3.9 points on CIFAR- 10 while using 40X fewer parameters-which is to our knowledge the first time a structured model has outperformed the unconstrained model for this task on a realistic dataset 42. We also find that the addition of a lightweight butterfly layer improves the accuracy of a modern ResNet architecture by 0.43 points. Finally, our method is simple with an easily implementable fast algorithm. We compare the training and inference speed of our implementation to specialized implementations of discrete transforms (Section 4.3). Our generic representation comes within 3-5X of implementations for specific transforms such as the DFT and DCT, while still being capable of learning a rich class of more general transforms. ## 2 Related Work\n\nFast transforms are crucial and ubiquitous in the machine learning pipelines, from data preprocessing, feature generation, and dimensionality reduction to compressing models. For example, the DFT and DCT form the basis of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), a standard feature representation for speech recognition [21]. State-of-the-art kernel approximation methods leverage circulant matrices (i.e., convolution) 49] and the DFT and Hadamard transform [24, 50] for fast projection. Structured matrices, which are matrix representations of fast transforms, play a crucial role in designing fast neural network layers with few parameters 40, 10. Given their importance, there have been significant efforts in finding more and more general classes of fast transforms. Traditional classes of structured matrices such as the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, and Cauchy matrices are ubiquitous in engineering and signal processing [35], and more recently have found use in deep learning. These were generalized under the seminal notion of low displacement rank (LDR) introduced by Kailath et al. [22], and were later unified under a single class of displacement structure (the confluent Cauchy-like matrices) introduced by Olshevsky \\& Shokrollahi 34 to solve the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem. Another class of fast transforms that directly generalize the DFT and DCT are based on orthogonal polynomials [7], which find usage in areas from differential equations to optics. Both orthogonal polynomial transforms [12], and all of the previously introduced matrices with displacement rank structure, were further\n\n[^0]significantly generalized under a single class by De Sa et al. 8. Notably, almost all of the structured matrix classes mentioned here exhibit a form of recursive structure in their construction and superfast algorithms. Since the product of sparse matrices immediately has a fast multiplication algorithm, the problem of sparse matrix factorization has been tackled in many settings. Sparse PCA 51] and dictionary learning [29] factor a matrix into two components, one of which is sparse. Sparse matrix factorization with more than two factors has also been considered, for example in the setting where the true matrix is the product of random sparse matrices 33, or in the context of learning multi-layer sparse approximations 25, 26. Our approach differs from these in that we focus on the recursive structure of the transforms - not just the sparsity of their factors-leading to sparse and structured transforms, and avoiding the discreteness problem inherent to learning sparsity. Since most distinct transforms typically require significant work both to design fast algorithms and to efficiently implement them on different platforms, there have been attempts to automatically learn these fast algorithms. The field of algebraic signal processing [39] uses methods from representation theory of groups and algebras to automatically generate fast algorithms from the symbolic form of the transform matrix. However, these methods require search over a combinatorially-large discrete space, limiting their approaches to small matrices of size up to $8 \\times 8$ [14, 45]. Attempts to learn general algorithms such as matching 31, sorting [16], and traveling salesman [2] using differentiable architectures face a similar challenge of having to effectively explore a large discrete space. Thus, they only work for problems of size at most 100. By contrast, our approach simplifies the discreteness of the problem into learning a simpler set of permutations, allowing us to recover fast algorithms for realistic dimensions. Independently, there has been growing interest in compressed deep learning models, motivated by the goal of adapting them to resource-constrained environments. A common approach for learning compressed models involves replacing the unconstrained weight matrices with a class of structured matrices and learning directly on the parametrization of that class. The most effective methods use matrix classes that are explicitly related to Fourier transforms 40, or employ highly specialized and complicated recursive algorithms 42]. As our method also implicitly defines a highly compressible subclass of matrices with linear parameter count and efficient multiplication, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for matrices in such end-to-end ML models. ## 3 Recovering Fast Transforms\n\nWe now set up and describe our approach. We first reiterate the connection between fast algorithms and sparse matrix factorization, and briefly outline a quintessential divide-and-conquer algorithm (the FFT) as motivation. We then elaborate the details of our method for learning particular recursive algorithms, including a core permutation-learning step that enables it to capture a wider range of structures. We also discuss the expressive power of these matrices, including which transforms they capture perfectly, and define a hierarchy of matrix classes built on butterflies that can theoretically capture richer recursive structures. ### 3.1 Preliminaries\n\nSparse factorizations One method of constructing matrices with obvious fast matrix-vector multiplication is as a product of sparse matrices, so that multiplication by an arbitrary vector will have cost proportional to the total number of nonzeros of the matrices in the product. Surprisingly, the converse is also true. The notion of sparse product width (SPW) [8, which roughly corresponds to the total sparsity of a factorization of a matrix, turns out to be equivalent to the length of the shortest linear straight-line program describing a matrix (up to a constant). Hence, it is an optimal descriptor of the algorithmic complexity of matrix-vector multiplication on these types of models [3. Given the general correspondence between sparse factorization and fast algorithms, we consider specific types of discrete transforms and their recursive factorizations. This is a prototype for our parameterization of fast recursive algorithms in Section 3.2\n\nCase study: DFT The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) transforms a complex input vector $x=$ $\\left[x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$ into a complex output vector $X=\\left[X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{N-1}\\right]$ by expressing the input in the basis of the complex exponentials:\n\n$$\nX_{k}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{-\\frac{2 \\pi i}{N} k n}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, N-1, N=2^{m}\n$$\n\nLet $\\omega_{N}:=e^{2 \\pi i / N}$ denote a primitive $N$-th root of unity. The DFT can be expressed as matrix multiplication by the DFT matrix $F_{N} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$, where $\\left(F_{N}\\right)_{k n}=\\omega_{N}^{-k n}$. The DFT of size $N$ can be reduced to two DFTs of size $N / 2$ on the even indices and the odd indices:\n\n$$\nF_{N} x=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\nF_{N / 2} x_{\\mathrm{even}}+\\Omega_{N / 2} F_{N / 2} x_{\\text {odd }} \\\\\nF_{N / 2} x_{\\text {even }}-\\Omega_{N / 2} F_{N / 2} x_{\\text {odd }}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{\\text {even }}=\\left[x_{0}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{N-2}\\right], x_{\\text {odd }}=\\left[x_{1}, x_{3}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$, and $\\Omega_{N / 2}$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $1, \\omega_{N}^{-1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{N}^{-(N / 2-1)}$. This recursive structure yields the efficient recursive Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This computation can be written as a matrix factorization\n\n$$\nF_{N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nI_{N / 2} & \\Omega_{N / 2} \\\\\nI_{N / 2} & -\\Omega_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nF_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { Sort the even } \\\\\n\\text { and odd indices }\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{N / 2}$ is the identity matrix, and the last factor is the permutation matrix $P_{N}$ that separates the even and odd indices (e.g., mapping $[0,1,2,3]$ to $[0,2,1,3]$ ) (see Figure 2]. Unrolling the recursion, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{N} & =B_{N}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nF_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N} \\\\\n& =B_{N}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nB_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & B_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nF_{N / 4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 4} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & F_{N / 4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & F_{N / 4}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nP_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & P_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N} \\\\\n& =\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(B_{N} \\ldots\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nB_{2} & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\ldots & B_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nP_{2} & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\ldots & P_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\ldots P_{N}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe product of all the $B_{N / 2^{k}}$ matrices on the left is called a butterfly matrix, and each factor $B_{N / 2^{k}}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ block matrix of diagonal matrices called a butterfly factor. Figure 1 illustrates the sparsity pattern of the structured butterfly factors. One can also combine the product of permutation matrices on the right to obtain a single permutation called the bit-reversal permutation, which sorts the indices by the reverse of their binary representation (e.g. $[0, \\ldots, 7] \\rightarrow[0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7]$ ). Other transforms have similar recursive structure but differ in the entries of $B_{N / 2^{k}}$, and in the permutation. For example, the DCT involves separating the even and the odd indices, and then reversing the second half (e.g., $[0,1,2,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,1,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,3,1]$ ). Appendix A provides some examples of how important transforms, such as the DFT, DCT, Hadamard, and convolutions, can factor as similar products of sparse matrices. ### 3.2 Recovering Fast Transform Algorithms\n\nMany previous works attempt to compress generic matrices by sparsifying them. We note that allowing for products of matrices with a total sparsity budget is strictly more expressive than a single matrix with that sparsity, while retaining the same compression and computation complexity. Therefore one can hope to recover all fast algorithms by learning over the set of matrix products with a total sparsity budget. However, this is infeasible to learn due to the discreteness of the sparsity constraint (Section 122). We instead use a class of matrices built as products of specific factors that captures the recursive nature of many fast algorithms. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_bdb1f06984456725f946g-05.jpg?height=201&width=825&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=647)\n\nFigure 1: Butterfly matrix for $N=16$. From left to right: single copy of $B_{16}$, blocks of $B_{8}$, blocks of $B_{4}$, blocks of $B_{2}$. A butterfly parametrization Let $x=\\left[x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$ be an input vector ${ }^{2}$ Let $\\mathcal{T}_{N}$ be a linear transform of size $N$ with matrix representation $T_{N} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N \\times N}$, where $\\mathbb{F} \\in\\{\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}\\}$. A general recursive structure is to separate the input vector into two halves by some permutation, apply the transform on each half, and combine the result in a linear manner by scaling by an diagonal matrix and adding the results. Written as a matrix factorization:\n\n$$\nT_{N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\nD_{1} & D_{2} \\\\\nD_{3} & D_{4}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nT_{N / 2} & 0_{N / 2 \\times N / 2} \\\\\n0_{N / 2 \\times N / 2} & T_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{N}$ is some permutation matrix and $D_{1}, \\ldots, D_{4} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N / 2}$ are diagonal matrices. Inspired by the factors of the FFT, we call the matrix $\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}D_{1} & D_{2} \\\\ D_{3} & D_{4}\\end{array}\\right]$ a butterfly factor, denoted by $B_{N}$. Unrolling the recursion as in equation (1) gives the factorization $T_{N}=B^{(N)} P^{(N)}$, where $B^{(N)}$ is a butterfly matrix and $P^{(N)}$ is a permutation that can be written as the product of $\\log _{2}(N)$ simpler block permutations. We also consider composing this module, hence learn either\n\n$$\nT_{N}=B^{(N)} P^{(N)} \\quad T_{N}=B_{2}^{(N)} P_{2}^{(N)} B_{1}^{(N)} P_{1}^{(N)}\n$$\n\nwhich we term the BP and the BPBP parametrization respectively. One dimensional convolutions (i.e. circulant matrices) are notably captured by BPBP, since they can be computed via an FFT, a component-wise product, then an inverse FFT (see Appendix A). In the case of the FFT, as in Section 3.1 the entries of the butterfly factors are called twiddle factors, and the combined permutation $P^{(N)}$ is called the bit-reversal permutation. Learning a recursive permutation The butterfly blocks in the BP or BPBP parametrization have a fixed sparsity pattern and their parameters can be directly optimized. However, the transforms we are interested in capturing frequently require different permutations as part of the \"divide\" step, which form a set of discrete objects that we must consider. We will restrict to learning over permutations that have a simple structure often encountered in these algorithms: we assume that the distribution factors into $\\log _{2} N$ steps following the $\\log _{2} N$ recursive layers. At each step in the recursion, the permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ is allowed to either keep the first half and second half intact or separate the even and the odd indices (e.g., $[0,1,2,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,1,3]$ ). Then, it can choose to reverse the first half (e.g., $[0,1] \\rightarrow[1,0]$ ) and can choose to reverse the second half (e.g., $[2,3] \\rightarrow[3,2]$ ). Thus at each step, there are 3 binary choices and hence 8 possible permutations. These are illustrated in Figure 2, where $P_{N}^{a}$ denotes the permutation matrix on $N$ elements that separates the even and odd elements, $P_{N}^{b}$ denotes the permutation matrix that reverses the first half, and $P_{N}^{c}$ denotes the permutation matrix that reverses the second half. Instead of searching over $8^{\\log _{2} N}$ discrete permutations, we parameterize the permutation $P^{(N)}$ as a categorical distribution of these $8^{\\log _{2} N}$ permutations. The permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ at step $k$ is thus chosen as a convex combination of the 8 possible choices:\n\n$$\nP_{N / 2^{k}}=p_{c b a} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{a}+p_{c b} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b}+\\ldots\n$$\n\nThis can be learned by representing this probability distribution $\\left\\{p_{c b a}, p_{c b}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ for example via logits and the softmax.

One of 8 possible permutations can be constructed by multiplying a subset of these matrices in the presented order. We make the further simplification that the probabilities $p_{c b a}$ factor into the three components; conceptually, that the choices of choosing $P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c}, P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b}, P_{N / 2^{k}}^{a}$ to be part of the product are independent of each other. This results in the representation\n\n$$\nP_{N / 2^{k}}=\\prod_{s=c, b, a}\\left(p_{s} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{s}+\\left(1-p_{s}\\right) I\\right)\n$$\n\nThus we learn the permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ via equation 3y optimizing over 3 logits $\\ell_{a}, \\ell_{b}, \\ell_{c}$ and setting $p_{s}=\\sigma\\left(\\ell_{s}\\right)$, where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. To encourage the distribution over permutations to be peaked, one can add entropy regularization [15] or semantic loss [46.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/35 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nOur implementation is built on top of the publicly available implementation of Thomas et al. 42 with the same hyperparameters, and we report their numbers for the competing baseline methods directly. We test on the three main datasets from Thomas et al. 42]: two challenging variants of MNIST-one with randomly rotated images and random background, the other with correlated background noise-and the standard CIFAR-10 dataset. Table 1: Test accuracy when replacing the hidden layer with structured classes. For the BPBP methods, the permutations $P$ have been fixed to the bit-reversal permutation. The butterfly parameterization achieves higher accuracy than the unstructured layer on all datasets. | Method | MNIST-bg-rot | MNIST-noise | CIFAR-10 | Compression factor |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Unstructured | 44.08 | 65.15 | 46.03 | 1 |\n| BPBP (complex, fixed permutation) | $\\mathbf{4 6 . 2 6}$ | 77.00 | $\\mathbf{4 9 . 9 3}$ | 39.4 |\n| BPBP (real, fixed permutation) | 46.16 | 75.00 | 48.69 | 56.9 |\n| LDR-TD 42] | 45.81 | $\\mathbf{7 8 . 4 5}$ | 45.33 | 56.9 |\n| Toeplitz-like [40] | 42.67 | 75.75 | 41.78 | 56.9 |\n| Fastfood 47] | 38.13 | 63.55 | 39.64 | 78.7 |\n| Circulant 6] | 34.46 | 65.35 | 34.28 | 93.0 |\n| Low-rank [9] | 35.67 | 52.25 | 32.28 | 56.9 |\n\nTable 1 reports results for variants of our butterfly parametrization, compared to the unstructured matrix baseline and other structured matrix approaches. Notably, the butterfly methods achieve higher classification accuracy than the fully-connected layer on all datasets and are highly competitive with the other approaches. We note that improvements over unconstrained matrices can arise from lower generalization error due to fewer parameters (relating to VC bounds, Proposition 2), or better inductive bias encoded by the structured class. For example, convolutions are important in image tasks due to encoding shift equivariance, and Thomas et al. 42 hypothesize that their structured classes improve over FC layers through imposing approximate equivariance to more general transformations. Since our BP parametrization can represent arbitrary convolutions, it can encode these important priors. ResNet In addition to the standard single hidden layer benchmarks, we test the effect of using butterfly layers in a standard ResNet18 [18] implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This architecture is normally fully convolutional, ending with a FC layer of dimensions $512 \\times 10$ before the softmax. However, we experiment with adding an additional FC or structured layer right before this final FC layer. Table 2 shows that the ResNet18 architecture can benefit from an additional fully connected layer, and using a BPBP layer instead improves performance even more while adding a negligible ( $0.07 \\%$ increase) number of parameters to the original model. Table 2: Classification accuracy for the ResNet18 architecture with different layers inserted before the final FC/softmax layer. | Last layer | None | FC | BPBP |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Accuracy | $93.58 \\pm 0.15$ | $93.89 \\pm 0.19$ | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 1} \\pm 0.09$ |\n\n### 4.3 Training and Inference Speed Comparison\n\nBy design, the BP parameterization yields a fast algorithm of complexity $O(N \\log N)$, no matter which transform it learns. Moreover, given the parameters of the BP model, it is easy to implement this fast algorithm (this can be done in 5 lines of Python, and our code provides a function to do this automatically). The BP parameterization captures many common transforms (Section 4.1), and its implementation makes no transform-specific optimizations. Nevertheless, our simple implementation is surprisingly competitive with hand-tuned kernels both for training and for inference (after the parameters of the BP model are learned and we wish to evaluate $B P x$ for new input $x$ ). In Figure 4, we compare the speed of the BP fast multiplication against specialized implementation of common transforms such as the FFT, DCT, and DST (all have complexity $O(N \\log N)$ ), using dense matrix-vector multiply (GEMV, complexity $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ ) as a baseline. For training with realistic input sizes $N=1024$ and batch size 256 on GPU, the training time (forward and\nbackward) of butterfly matrix is $15 \\%$ faster than dense matrix multiply (GEMM from cuBLAS) and within $40 \\%$ of FFT (from cuFFT). For inference on CPU, the BP fast multiplication can be one or two orders of magnitude faster than GEMV, is within a factor of 5 of the FFT, and is within a factor of 3 of the DCT and the DST, across a range of input sizes. The GEMM/GEMV and the FFT are two of the most heavily tuned numerical routines. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_bdb1f06984456725f946g-11.jpg?height=732&width=1612&top_left_y=490&top_left_x=243)\n\nFigure 4: Speedup of FFT and Butterfly against dense matrix-matrix multiply (GEMM) for training, and FFT, DCT, DST, and BP against dense matrix-vector multiply (GEMV) for inference. Butterfly's performance is constant with respect to any of the possible transforms it can learn, in contrast to the highly tuned implementations for specific transforms. ## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe address the problem of automatically learning fast algorithms for a class of important linear transforms, through a parameterization of recursive algorithms via butterfly factorizations. We validate our method by learning transforms including the DFT, DCT, Hadamard transform, and convolutions up to machine precision and dimension $N=1024$. Finally, we show that the same method yields consistent performance improvements and substantial compression and speed increases as a component of end-to-end ML models. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Maximilian Lam for his help with early experiments.

For the BP methods, the learning rate was tested for the values $\\{0.005,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2\\}$; parameters outside this range were found to be ineffective.

For each method, Table 2 reports the mean and standard deviation of the test accuracies for the hyperparameters with the highest average validation accuracy. ## C. 4 Speed Comparison\n\nIn Section 4.3, we benchmark the speed of training and inference of butterfly factorizations. For training, we compare our CUDA implementation of the fast algorithm for butterfly matrices with dense matrix-matrix multiply (GEMM from cuBLAS) and FFT (from cuFFT). The batch size is 256, and we measure the total time of the forward and backward pass. The experiment is run on a Tesla P100 GPU with 16 GB of memory. For inference, we compare our simple Python implementation of the fast algorithm for the BP parameterization, against dense matrix-vector multiplication (GEMV), FFT, DCT, and DST. Our BP parameterization here refers to the product of a butterfly matrix $B^{(N)}$ and a fixed permutation $P^{(N)}$ (say, learned from data). We use the standard dense matrix-vector multiplication implementation in Numpy (BLAS binding), the FFT implementation from Numpy and the DCT and DST implementation from Scipy (FFTPACK binding). We compare their speed in single-threaded mode, running on a server Intel Xeon CPU E5-2690 v4 at 2.60GHz. Results are shown in Figure 4\n\n## D BP Hierarchy\n\nIn Definition 1. we defined the notion of a BP hierarchy, which we believes captures a natural class of matrices. To this point, we offer the following observations, the latter left as a conjecture, about the expressiveness of this hierarchy, supplementing the inclusion results of Proposition 1. Proposition 3. For every fixed $c \\geq 1$, there is a sufficiently large $N$ such that there is an $N \\times N$ matrix $M_{N}$ that is in $(B P)^{c+1}$ but not in $(B P)^{c}$. Proof. Given $c$, fix $N$ such that $N$ is even and such that $c<\\frac{N}{8 \\log _{2} N}$. For sake of contradiction, assume that every $N \\times N$ matrix in (BP) ${ }^{c+1}$ is also in $(\\mathrm{BP})^{c}$. Let $A$ be an arbitrary $\\frac{N}{2} \\times \\frac{N}{2}$ matrix. Then, from Proposition 1, $A$ is in $(\\mathrm{BP})_{2}^{2 N+10}$. Therefore, from Definition 1, there is some $N \\times N$ matrix $M \\in(\\mathrm{BP})^{2 N+10}$ such that the upper-left $\\frac{N}{2} \\times \\frac{N}{2}$ entries are $A$. From our assumption, we can replace the first $c+1$ BP factors in $M$ with $c$ (possibly different) BP factors. We can repeat this process until we are left with $c$ (BP) factors, so $M$ in $(\\mathrm{BP})^{c}$. This representation for $M$ has $c \\cdot 2 N \\log _{2} N$ parameters, which must be less than $\\frac{N}{8 \\log _{2} N} \\cdot 2 N \\log _{2} N=\\frac{N^{2}}{4}$ based on how we fixed $N$ above. However, $A$ (and therefore $M$ ) has $\\frac{N^{2}}{4}$ arbitrary entries, contradicting that it can be represented with fewer than $\\frac{N^{2}}{4}$ parameters. Hence, there must be some $N \\times N$ matrix in $(\\mathrm{BP})^{c+1}$ that is not in $(\\mathrm{BP})^{c}$. Conjecture 1. Let $M$ be an $N \\times N$ matrix such that for any $x \\in \\mathcal{F}^{N}, M x$ can be computed with an arithmetic circuit of size $N$ poly $\\log (N)$ and depth poly $\\log (N)$. Then, $M$ is in $(B P)_{O(1)}^{\\mathrm{poly} \\log N}$. We believe that we can prove an approximation of the above using known approximations of the Jacobi transform by the DCT (up to some scaling) 41. It is known that such transforms have an arithmetic circuit of the kind mentioned in the conjecture above $[12$. [^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ This characterization was equivalently known in the language of arithmetic circuits [3]. [^1]:    ${ }^{2}$ For simplicity, we assume that $N$ is a power of 2 .

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.55)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2978-2988, 2019.

It inherits the fine-to-coarse-grained learnable hierarchy of traditional butterflies and when deployed to neural networks, the prominent structures and sparsity in a DeBut layer constitutes a new way for network compression. We apply DeBut as a drop-in replacement of standard fully connected and convolutional layers, and demonstrate its superiority in homogenizing a neural network and rendering it favorable properties such as light weight and low inference complexity, without compromising accuracy. The natural complexity-accuracy tradeoff arising from the myriad deformations of a DeBut layer also opens up new rooms for analytical and practical research.

Special linear layers such as masked and 1x1 convolutions play a key role in existing architectures because they increase expressive power while having tractable Jacobians and inverses. We propose a new family of invertible linear layers based on butterfly layers, which are known to theoretically capture complex linear structures including permutations and periodicity, yet can be inverted efficiently. This representational power is a key advantage of our approach, as such structures are common in many real-world datasets. Based on our invertible butterfly layers, we construct a new class of normalizing flow models called ButterflyFlow. Empirically, we demonstrate that ButterflyFlows not only achieve strong density estimation results on natural images such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet 32x32, but also obtain significantly better log-likelihoods on structured datasets such as galaxy images and MIMIC-III patient cohorts -- all while being more efficient in terms of memory and computation than relevant baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices butterfly computation*\n\n*Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices, and proposes a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which is shown to be better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

While attention-based models are a popular and effective choice in modeling short-range interactions, their performance on tasks requiring long range reasoning has been largely inadequate. In an exciting result, Gu et al. (ICLR 2022) proposed the $\\textit{Structured State Space}$ (S4) architecture delivering large gains over state-of-the-art models on several long-range tasks across various modalities. The core proposition of S4 is the parameterization of state matrices via a diagonal plus low rank structure, allowing efficient computation. In this work, we show that one can match the performance of S4 even without the low rank correction and thus assuming the state matrices to be diagonal. Our $\\textit{Diagonal State Space}$ (DSS) model matches the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena tasks, speech classification on Speech Commands dataset, while being conceptually simpler and straightforward to implement.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 217  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5. Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices butterfly computation*\n\n*Weiyang Liu, Zeju Qiu, Yao Feng, Yuliang Xiu, Yuxuan Xue, Longhui Yu, Haiwen Feng, Zhen Liu, Juyeon Heo, Songyou Peng, Yandong Wen, Michael J. Black, Adrian Weller, Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures is proposed, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT).\n\n**Abstract:** Large foundation models are becoming ubiquitous, but training them from scratch is prohibitively expensive. Thus, efficiently adapting these powerful models to downstream tasks is increasingly important. In this paper, we study a principled finetuning paradigm -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) -- for downstream task adaptation. Despite demonstrating good generalizability, OFT still uses a fairly large number of trainable parameters due to the high dimensionality of orthogonal matrices. To address this, we start by examining OFT from an information transmission perspective, and then identify a few key desiderata that enable better parameter-efficiency. Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, we propose an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures. We apply this parameterization to OFT, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT).

Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices butterfly computation*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. Efficient Identification of Butterfly Sparse Matrix Factorizations\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices butterfly computation*\n\n*R\u00e9mi Gribonval, Elisa Riccietti, L\u00e9on Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Fast transforms correspond to factorizations of the form $\\mathbf{Z} = \\mathbf{X}^{(1)} \\ldots \\mathbf{X}^{(J)}$, where each factor $ \\mathbf{X}^{(\\ell)}$ is sparse and possibly structured. This paper investigates essential uniqueness of such factorizations, i.e., uniqueness up to unavoidable scaling ambiguities. Our main contribution is to prove that any $N \\times N$ matrix having the so-called butterfly structure admits an essentially unique factorization into $J$ butterfly factors (where $N = 2^{J}$), and that the factors can be recovered by a hierarchical factorization method, which consists in recursively factorizing the considered matrix into two factors. This hierarchical identifiability property relies on a simple identifiability condition in the two-layer and fixed-support setting. This approach contrasts with existing ones that fit the product of butterfly factors to a given matrix via gradient descent. The proposed method can be applied in particular to retrieve the factorization of the Hadamard or the discrete Fourier transform matrices of size $N=2^J$. Computing such factorizations costs $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2})$, which is of the order of dense matrix-vector multiplication, while the obtained factorizations enable fast $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ matrix-vector multiplications and have the potential to be applied to compress deep neural networks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using butterfly-structured matrices, here are some key points and references that address the specified areas of interest:\n\n### Computational Complexity\nButterfly-structured matrices are known for their efficient computational properties.

This approach leverages existing GEMM (General Matrix Multiply) optimizations, which are highly optimized on modern hardware.\n- The \"Monarch Mixer\" architecture further supports this by utilizing sub-quadratic GEMM-based operations, which are particularly efficient on modern hardware due to their parallelizable nature.\n\n### Training Stability\nTraining stability is crucial for the successful deployment of any neural network model.\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss training stability for butterfly-structured matrices, general principles from structured state space models suggest that careful initialization and regularization techniques can enhance stability. For example, initializing weights from a structured distribution or using techniques like orthogonal initialization can help in maintaining stability during training.\n- Additionally, the hierarchical structure of butterfly matrices might inherently provide some stability due to the structured and predictable nature of the matrix operations.\n\n### Initialization Strategies\nProper initialization strategies are essential for the effective training of neural networks.\n\n- For structured matrices, including butterfly matrices, initialization strategies often involve ensuring that the matrices maintain their structural properties. This can be achieved by initializing the weights in a way that respects the hierarchical or sparse structure of the matrix.\n- \"Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\" suggests that careful design of the structured matrices, including their initialization, is key to achieving both computational efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n### Theoretical Analysis\nTheoretical analysis of butterfly-structured matrices provides insights into their efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- Theoretical work on butterfly matrices often involves analyzing their computational complexity and expressiveness. For instance, the hierarchical structure of butterfly matrices allows for sub-quadratic time complexity in certain matrix operations, which is theoretically grounded and beneficial for large-scale models.\n\nIn summary, using butterfly-structured matrices in autoregressive language models can offer significant advantages in terms of computational complexity, hardware efficiency, and potentially training stability, provided that careful initialization strategies are employed. These matrices leverage existing hardware optimizations and maintain rich representational capacity, making them a promising direction for improving autoregressive language model design.\n",

Transformers pre-trained on large amounts of unlabelled text via a denoising objective have become the standard in natural language processing, exhibiting impressive amounts of linguistic and world knowledge $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+} 20, \\mathrm{BMH}^{+} 21\\right]$. This recipe has also led to remarkable developments in the areas of vision $\\left[\\mathrm{RPG}^{+} 21, \\mathrm{RKH}^{+} 21\\right]$ and speech [DXX18, BZMA20]. The contextualizing component of the Transformer is the multi-head attention layer which, for inputs of length $L$, has an expensive $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity. This becomes prohibitive on tasks where the model is required to capture long-range interactions of various parts of a long input. To alleviate this issue, several Transformer variants have been proposed with reduced compute and memory requirements [QML ${ }^{+}$20, KKL20, RSVG21, BPC20, GB20, KVPF20, WLK ${ }^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{CLD}^{+}$21, ZS21, GDG $\\left.{ }^{+} 21\\right]$ (cf. [TDBM20] for a survey). Despite this effort, all these models have reported inadequate performance on benchmarks created to formally evaluate and quantify a model's ability to perform long-range reasoning (such as Long Range Arena $\\left[\\mathrm{TDA}^{+} 21\\right]$ and SCROLLS $\\left[\\mathrm{SSI}^{+} 22\\right]$ ). In a recent breakthrough result, Gu et al. [GGR22] proposed S 4 , a sequence-to-sequence model that uses linear state spaces for contextualization instead of attention. It has shown remarkable performance on tasks requiring long-range reasoning in domains such as text, images and audio. For instance, on Long Range Arena it advances the state-of-the-art by 19 accuracy points over the best performing Transformer variant. Its remarkable abilities are not limited to text and images and carry over to tasks such as time-series forecasting, speech recognition and audio generation [GGDR22]. Despite S4's achievements, its design is complex and is centered around the HiPPO theory, which is a mathematical framework for long-range modeling [VKE19, $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+} 20, \\mathrm{GJG}^{+}$21]. [GGR22]\n\n[^0]showed that state space models with various alternative initializations perform poorly in comparison to initializing the state-space parameters with a particular HiPPO matrix. In order to leverage this matrix, they parameterize the learned state spaces using a Diagonal Plus Low Rank (DLPR) structure and, as a result, need to employ several reduction steps and linear algebraic techniques to be able to compute the state space output efficiently, making S4 difficult to understand, implement and analyze. In this work, we show that it is possible to match S4's performance while using a much simpler, fullydiagonal parameterization of state spaces. While we confirm that random diagonal state spaces are less effective, we observe that there do in fact exist effective diagonal state matrices: simply removing the low-rank component of the DPLR HiPPO matrix still preserves its performance. Leveraging this idea, our proposed Diagonal State Space (DSS) model enforces state matrices to be diagonal, making it significantly simpler to formulate, implement and analyze, while being provably as expressive as general state spaces. In contrast to S4, DSS does not assume any specialized background beyond basic linear algebra and can be implemented in just a few lines of code. Our implementation fits in a single page and is provided in $\\S$ A. 5 (Figure 6). We evaluate the performance of DSS on Long Range Arena (LRA) which is a suite of sequencelevel classification tasks with diverse input lengths ( $1 K-16 K)$ requiring similarity, structural, and visual-spatial reasoning over a wide range of modalities such as text, natural/synthetic images, and mathematical expressions. Despite its simplicity, DSS delivers an average accuracy of 81.88 across the 6 tasks of LRA, comparable to the state-of-the-art performance of S4 (80.21). In addition, DSS maintains a comfortable 20 point lead over the best Transformer variant ( 81.88 vs 61.41 ). In the audio domain, we evaluate the performance of DSS on raw speech classification. On the Speech Commands dataset [War18], which consists of raw audio samples of length $16 K$, we again found the performance of DSS to be comparable to that of S4 ( 98.2 vs 98.1 ). To summarize, our results demonstrate that DSS is a simple and effective method for modeling long-range interactions in modalities such as text, images and audio. We believe that the effectiveness, efficiency and transparency of DSS can significantly contribute to the adoption of state space models over their attention-based peers. Our code is available at https://github.com/ag1988/dss. ## 2 Background\n\nWe start by reviewing the basics of time-invariant linear state spaces. State Spaces A continuous-time state space model (SSM) parameterized by the state matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ and vectors $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ is given by the differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t), y(t)=C x(t)\n$$\n\nwhich defines a function-to-function map $u(t) \\mapsto y(t)$. For a given value of time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}, u(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ denotes the value of the input signal $u, x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}$ denotes the state vector and $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ denotes the value of the output signal $y$. We call a state space diagonal if it has a diagonal state matrix. Discretization For a given sample time $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, the discretization of a continuous state space (Equation 1) assuming zero-order hold ${ }^{2}$ on $u$ is defined as a sequence-to-sequence map from $\\left(u_{0}, \\ldots, u_{L-1}\\right)=u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ to $\\left(y_{0}, \\ldots, y_{L-1}\\right)=y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ via the recurrence,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\bar{A} x_{k-1}+\\bar{B} u_{k} \\quad, \\quad y_{k}=\\bar{C} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\bar{A}=e^{A \\Delta}, \\bar{B}=(\\bar{A}-I) A^{-1} B, \\bar{C}=C\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAssuming $x_{-1}=0$ for simplicity, this recurrence can be explicitly unrolled as\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\sum_{j=0}^{k} \\overline{C A}^{j} \\bar{B} \\cdot u_{k-j}\n$$\n\nFor convenience, the scalars $\\overline{C A}^{k} \\bar{B}$ are gathered to define the SSM kernel $\\bar{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ as\n\n$$\n\\bar{K}=\\left(\\overline{C B}, \\overline{C A B}, \\ldots, \\overline{C A}^{L-1} \\bar{B}\\right)=\\left(C e^{A \\cdot k \\Delta}\\left(e^{A \\Delta}-I\\right) A^{-1} B\\right)_{0 \\leqslant k<L}\n$$\n\n[^1]where the last equality follows by substituting the values of $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}$ from Equation 2 .\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nFinally, we provide analysis and ablation experiments to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code ${ }^{1}$ and pre-trained model checkpoints ${ }^{2}$ are publicly available. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Attention Mechanism\n\nSuppose the input to the layer is $\\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ is the sequence length and $d$ is the embedding dimension, then the attention mechanism outputs\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}$. Here $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights. The attention mechanism can simultaneously compute the alignment between any pair of input tokens, such that it models long-range dependencies better than recurrent neural networks. Specifically, denote the attention score matrix $\\mathbf{A}=$ $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$. Then, $\\mathbf{A}_{i j}$ captures the alignment between the $i$-th and the $j$-th input tokens. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nContinuous time state space model. A continuous time latent space model maps a 1-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ to a $d_{s}$-dimensional latent state $x(t)$, after which $x(t)$ is mapped to a 1-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Concretely,\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nHere, $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Existing works leverage Eq. 2 to model long sequences. For example, Gu et al. (2020) claim that randomly initialized parameters $\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{C}$\n\n[^1]cannot model long-range dependencies well. Subsequently, a class of matrices (termed HiPPO, highorder polynomial projection operators) are proposed to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are designed such that the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ can memorize the history of the input $u(t)$ up to time $t$. Discrete time state space model. In practice, we often work with discrete sequences such as natural language inputs $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, where $L$ is the sequence length. To facilitate modeling discrete data, the model in Eq. 2 can be discretized (using the bilinear method) by a step size $\\Delta$, such that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C}} x_{k} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\overline{\\mathbf{A}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1}(\\mathbf{I}+\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) \\\\\n& \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\Delta / 2 \\cdot \\mathbf{A})^{-1} \\Delta \\mathbf{B}, \\quad \\overline{\\mathbf{C}}=\\mathbf{C}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWe unroll the above recurrent representation, after which we have\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{k} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}} u_{0}+\\cdots+\\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}} u_{k-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as a convolutional representation $y=\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} * u$, where the convolution kernel\n\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}=\\left(\\overline{\\mathbf{C B}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A B}}, \\cdots, \\overline{\\mathbf{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}\\right)\n$$\n\nHere, \" $*$ \" is the discrete convolution operator, $u$ represents the input sequence $\\left(u_{0}, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{L}\\right)$, and $y$ represents the corresponding output sequence $\\left(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\cdots, y_{L}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\nHowever, we found that these tricks are not necessary. For example, the learned transforms in Section 4.1 typically put weight at least 0.99 on a permutation. Initialization As the BP or BPBP construction is a product of many matrices, proper initialization is crucial to avoid exponential blowup in the size of the entries or condition numbers (i.e., the exploding/vanishing gradient problem [37]). We aim to initialize each butterfly factor to be close to unitary or orthogonal, so that the magnitude of the inputs and outputs to the transform are preserved. This is easy since each of the factors $B_{N}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ has exactly two nonzeros in each row and column; for example in the real case, initializing each entry of $B_{k}$ as $\\mathcal{N}(0,1 / 2)$ guarantees $\\mathbb{E} B_{k}^{*} B_{k}=I_{N}$. Comparison to related methods Some previous works have examined similar butterfly matrices in numerical algebra or machine learning [36, 20, 32, mainly motivated by trying to parametrize cheap orthogonal matrices. Our parametrization, motivated by the goal of learning recursive transforms, differs in several ways from all previous works: 1 . We explicitly model and learn a permutation matrix $P$. 2. Our relaxation does not enforce the matrix to be orthogonal. 3. Our butterfly factors are ordered so that closer elements interact first (Figure 1), whereas some works (e.g. [32]) reverse the order. 4. Every work has a different weight-tying scheme; ours ties the blocks in each butterfly factor, leading to fewer parameters and a tighter recursive interpretation than for example [20]. Our main baseline for deep learning experiments is Thomas et al. 42, who define a special matrix class with a complicated recursive algorithm. While our BP method and theirs share some overlap (e.g., they both capture circulant matrices), they have a distinct parametrization, and the exact relation between the BP hierarchy and their LDR-SD or LDR-TD classes is unknown. From a practical standpoint, BP is significantly faster and simpler to implement than their methods. ### 3.3 Expressivity and the butterfly hierarchy\n\nThe butterfly matrix $B$ has a total of $4 N$ learnable parameters (the butterfly factors $B_{N}, B_{N / 2}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ have $2 N, N, \\ldots, 4$ entries respectively). The overall permutation $P$ has $3 \\log _{2} N$ learnable parameters; we can also tie the logits of the $\\log _{2} N$ probabilistic permutations-reflecting the fact that for some algorithms the reduction from size $N$ to $N / 2$ is self-similar to the reduction from size $N / 2^{k}$ to $N / 2^{k+1}$ reducing this to just 3 parameters. We can define a natural hierarchy of matrix classes built on the BP primitive. This hierarchy covers a spectrum ranging from extremely structured matrices with a linear number of parameters, to the entire space of square matrices. Definition 1. For any dimension $N$, let $(\\mathrm{BP})_{r}^{k}(k, r \\in \\mathbb{N})$ denote the classes of matrices that can be expressed as\n\n$$\nS\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{k} B_{i} P_{i}\\right) S^{T}\n$$\n\nwhere each $B_{i} P_{i} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{r N \\times r N}$ is a BP module as in equation (2), and $S \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N \\times r N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}I_{N} & 0 & \\ldots & 0\\end{array}\\right]$ (that is, $S$ and $S^{T}$ select the upper left $N \\times N$ entries of the BP product matrix). The subscript $r$ is understood to be 1 if omitted. Note that the BP and BPBP classes are equivalent to (BP) ${ }^{1}$ and (BP) ${ }^{2}$ respectively. We remark that $B$ and $P$ are both capable of being the identity, and thus $(\\mathrm{BP})^{k} \\subseteq(\\mathrm{BP})^{k+1}$. The BP hierarchy is expressive enough to theoretically represent many important transforms with low depth, as well as all matrices with linear depth:\n\nProposition 1. $(B P)^{1}$ captures the fast Fourier transform, the fast Hadamard transform, and their inverses exactly. $(B P)^{2}$ captures the DCT, DST, and convolution exactly. All $N \\times N$ matrices are contained in $(B P)_{2}^{4 N+10}$. Proposition 1 is shown in Appendix B. We suggest some additional conjectures about the expressiveness of the BP hierarchy in Appendix D. Even though the BP parameterization is expressive, it still retains the learnability characteristic of compressed parameterizations. In fact, neural networks comprising layers of BP and BPBP matrices still have VC dimension that is almost linear in the number of parameters (Appendix B), similar to networks with fully-connected layers [1, 17] and LDR 42, which implies a corresponding sample complexity bound. ## 4 Empirical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the proposed approach to verify that our butterfly parameterization can both recover fast transforms and be integrated as an effective component in ML pipelines ${ }^{3}$, In Section 4.1, we confirm that it automatically learns the fast algorithms for many discrete transforms commonly used in signal processing and machine learning. Section 4.2 further shows that it can be a useful component to increase the performance of deep learning models while ensuring fast multiplication and few parameters by design. ### 4.1 Discrete Transforms\n\nBelow we list several important classes of structured matrices. Some of them are directly captured by our parametrization and we expect that they can be recovered close to perfectly, thus providing a $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm that closely approximates the naive $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ matrix multiplication. Others are not perfectly captured by the BPBP class but still have recursive structure; for these, we expect that our method reconstructs them better than standard matrix compression methods (sparse, low-rank, and combinations) can. Transforms We describe the matrices we evaluate on and their applications; a standard reference is Proakis 38.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states).

Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/86 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nChung et al. 2014) as well as more modern variants such as the QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), SRU (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017), RWKV (B. Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models butterfly matrices memory efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: state space models butterfly matrices memory efficiency*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes RNN heuristics, temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations while addressing their shortcomings, and introduces a trainable subset of structured matrices that endow LSSLs with long-range memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 360  (*Influential: 22*)\n\n#### 3. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: state space models butterfly matrices memory efficiency*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Reinforcement Learning with Fast and Forgetful Memory\n\n*From Search Query: state space models butterfly matrices memory efficiency*\n\n*Steven D. Morad, Ryan Kortvelesy, Stephan Liwicki, Amanda Prorok*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Fast and Forgetful Memory, an algorithm-agnostic memory model designed specifically for RL, which is a drop-in replacement for recurrent neural networks in recurrent RL algorithms, achieving greater reward than RNNs across various recurrent benchmarks and algorithms without changing any hyperparameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Nearly all real world tasks are inherently partially observable, necessitating the use of memory in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Most model-free approaches summarize the trajectory into a latent Markov state using memory models borrowed from Supervised Learning (SL), even though RL tends to exhibit different training and efficiency characteristics. Addressing this discrepancy, we introduce Fast and Forgetful Memory, an algorithm-agnostic memory model designed specifically for RL. Our approach constrains the model search space via strong structural priors inspired by computational psychology.

Rethinking Space-Time Networks with Improved Memory Coverage for Efficient Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: state space models butterfly matrices memory efficiency*\n\n*Ho Kei Cheng, Yu-Wing Tai, Chi-Keung Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective approach to modeling space-time correspondences in the context of video object segmentation that achieves new state-of-the-art results on both DAVIS and YouTubeVOS datasets while running significantly faster at 20+ FPS for multiple objects without bells and whistles.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple yet effective approach to modeling space-time correspondences in the context of video object segmentation. Unlike most existing approaches, we establish correspondences directly between frames without re-encoding the mask features for every object, leading to a highly efficient and robust framework. With the correspondences, every node in the current query frame is inferred by aggregating features from the past in an associative fashion. We cast the aggregation process as a voting problem and find that the existing inner-product affinity leads to poor use of memory with a small (fixed) subset of memory nodes dominating the votes, regardless of the query. In light of this phenomenon, we propose using the negative squared Euclidean distance instead to compute the affinities. We validated that every memory node now has a chance to contribute, and experimentally showed that such diversified voting is beneficial to both memory efficiency and inference accuracy. The synergy of correspondence networks and diversified voting works exceedingly well, achieves new state-of-the-art results on both DAVIS and YouTubeVOS datasets while running significantly faster at 20+ FPS for multiple objects without bells and whistles.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 232  (*Influential: 79*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using state space models with butterfly matrices, focusing on memory access patterns, cache efficiency, integration with attention mechanisms, and practical performance benchmarks, here are some key points and references:\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Cache Efficiency\n\n- **Butterfly Matrices and Structured Sparsity**: Butterfly matrices are inherently sparse and structured, which can significantly improve memory access patterns and cache efficiency. These matrices can be computed efficiently using existing General Matrix Multiply (GEMM) operations, which are highly optimized for modern hardware. The structured sparsity in butterfly matrices allows for better utilization of CPU and GPU caches, reducing the number of memory accesses and improving overall performance.\n\n- **Cache-Friendly Implementation**: The hierarchical structure of butterfly matrices enables cache-friendly implementations. By ordering the computations to maximize the use of the CPU cache, as seen in optimized libraries like OpenBLAS, the performance can be significantly improved. This approach minimizes the number of accesses to main memory, which is a critical bottleneck in many compute-intensive tasks.\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Combining with Attention**: State space models using butterfly matrices can be integrated with attention mechanisms to enhance the modeling of long-range dependencies. For instance, the hierarchical structure of butterfly matrices can capture both local and global dependencies efficiently, which complements the attention mechanism's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. This combination can potentially replace or augment dense layers in Transformer models, improving both efficiency and expressiveness.\n\n- **Structured State Space Models**: Research by Albert Gu and colleagues on structured state space models shows how these models can be generalized to include attention mechanisms. These models can efficiently model time-dependent processes and long-range dependencies, which are crucial for autoregressive language models. The integration of butterfly matrices within these state space models can further enhance their computational efficiency and stability.\n\n## Practical Performance Benchmarks\n\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: Studies have shown that butterfly matrices can achieve efficient computation with a complexity of O(N log N), which is significantly better than the O(N^2) complexity of dense matrices. This efficiency translates into practical performance improvements, especially in large-scale language models where computational resources are a major constraint. Benchmarks from papers like \"ButterflyFlow\" and \"Deformable Butterfly\" demonstrate the potential of these matrices in real-world applications, including improved training times and better model performance.\n\n- **Hardware Optimization**: The use of butterfly matrices aligns well with hardware optimization strategies. For example, the structured sparsity and the ability to use GEMM operations make these matrices highly suitable for GPU acceleration. This alignment can lead to substantial speedups in both training and inference, as seen in the performance benchmarks of similar optimized models.\n\n## Specific State Space Model Architectures\n\n- **ButterflyFlow and Deformable Butterfly**: These architectures utilize butterfly matrices to build invertible layers and highly structured sparse linear transforms, respectively. These models have been shown to capture complex linear structures efficiently and can be integrated into various neural network architectures, including autoregressive language models. The hierarchical structure and sparsity of these matrices make them particularly suitable for state space models.\n\nIn summary, the use of butterfly matrices in state space models offers several advantages, including efficient memory access patterns, cache-friendly implementations, seamless integration with attention mechanisms, and significant performance improvements. These aspects make them a promising direction for improving autoregressive language model design.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

We have introduced a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and the corresponding new update rule. This network can store exponentially many patterns, retrieves patterns with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. We analyzed the attention heads of BERT models. The new modern Hopfield networks have been integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. Hopfield layers that equip neural network layers with memories improved state-of-the-art in three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems and on immune repertoire classification, and on two drug design dataset. They yielded the best results among different machine learning methods on the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe ELLIS Unit Linz, the LIT AI Lab and the Institute for Machine Learning are supported by the Land Ober\u00f6sterreich, LIT grants DeepToxGen (LIT-2017-3-YOU-003), and AI-SNN (LIT2018-6-YOU-214), the Medical Cognitive Computing Center (MC3), Janssen Pharmaceutica, UCB Biopharma, Merck Group, Audi.JKU Deep Learning Center, Audi Electronic Venture GmbH, TGW, Primal, S3AI (FFG-872172), Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), Anyline, FILL, EnliteAI, Google Brain, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, T\u00dcV Austria, DCS, and the NVIDIA Corporation.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

To approximate $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$, we use the $2^{\\text {nd }}$-order Taylor series feature map, picking $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d^{2}}$ such that\n\n$$\n\\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}\\right)^{\\top} \\phi\\left(\\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)=1+\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}+\\frac{\\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}_{j}\\right)^{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nWhile Zhang et al. 13 note that picking a feature map with $\\tilde{d}=d^{2}$ results in linear attention with $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity and large recurrent state of size $O\\left(d^{3}\\right)$, we can tradeoff efficiency for recall capacity by projecting queries and keys to smaller dimensions i.e., $\\boldsymbol{W}_{q}, \\boldsymbol{W}_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d^{\\prime}}$ with $d^{\\prime}=16$. By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Efficient Active Search for Combinatorial Optimization Problems\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Andr\u00e9 Hottung, Yeong-Dae Kwon, Kevin Tierney*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed methods offer a simple way to significantly improve the search performance of a given model and outperform state-of-the-art machine learning based methods on combinatorial problems, even surpassing the well-known heuristic solver LKH3 on the capacitated vehicle routing problem.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently numerous machine learning based methods for combinatorial optimization problems have been proposed that learn to construct solutions in a sequential decision process via reinforcement learning. While these methods can be easily combined with search strategies like sampling and beam search, it is not straightforward to integrate them into a high-level search procedure offering strong search guidance. Bello et al. (2016) propose active search, which adjusts the weights of a (trained) model with respect to a single instance at test time using reinforcement learning. While active search is simple to implement, it is not competitive with state-of-the-art methods because adjusting all model weights for each test instance is very time and memory intensive. Instead of updating all model weights, we propose and evaluate three efficient active search strategies that only update a subset of parameters during the search. The proposed methods offer a simple way to significantly improve the search performance of a given model and outperform state-of-the-art machine learning based methods on combinatorial problems, even surpassing the well-known heuristic solver LKH3 on the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Finally, we show that (efficient) active search enables learned models to effectively solve instances that are much larger than those seen during training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Yet, the rapid development of the field poses several challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion of methods to compare, limited transparency and consensus on best practices, as well as tedious re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often very partial, which can lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the progress of research. We propose Benchopt, a collaborative framework to automate, reproduce and publish optimization benchmarks in machine learning across programming languages and hardware architectures. Benchopt simplifies benchmarking for the community by providing an off-the-shelf tool for running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate its broad usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks: $\\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18 training for image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical findings that give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems, showing that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the reproducibility of research findings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Conservative Dual Policy Optimization for Efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Shen Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Conservative Dual Policy Optimization (CDPO), a policy that is first optimized under a reference model, which imitates the mechanism of PSRL while offering more stability and a conservative range of randomness.\n\n**Abstract:** Provably efficient Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) based on optimism or posterior sampling (PSRL) is ensured to attain the global optimality asymptotically by introducing the complexity measure of the model. However, the complexity might grow exponentially for the simplest nonlinear models, where global convergence is impossible within finite iterations. When the model suffers a large generalization error, which is quantitatively measured by the model complexity, the uncertainty can be large. The sampled model that current policy is greedily optimized upon will thus be unsettled, resulting in aggressive policy updates and over-exploration. In this work, we propose Conservative Dual Policy Optimization (CDPO) that involves a Referential Update and a Conservative Update. The policy is first optimized under a reference model, which imitates the mechanism of PSRL while offering more stability. A conservative range of randomness is guaranteed by maximizing the expectation of model value. Without harmful sampling procedures, CDPO can still achieve the same regret as PSRL. More importantly, CDPO enjoys monotonic policy improvement and global optimality simultaneously. Empirical results also validate the exploration efficiency of CDPO.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Parsimonious Black-Box Adversarial Attacks via Efficient Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Seungyong Moon, Gaon An, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an efficient discrete surrogate to the optimization problem which does not require estimating the gradient and consequently becomes free of the first order update hyperparameters to tune.\n\n**Abstract:** Solving for adversarial examples with projected gradient descent has been demonstrated to be highly effective in fooling the neural network based classifiers. However, in the black-box setting, the attacker is limited only to the query access to the network and solving for a successful adversarial example becomes much more difficult. To this end, recent methods aim at estimating the true gradient signal based on the input queries but at the cost of excessive queries. We propose an efficient discrete surrogate to the optimization problem which does not require estimating the gradient and consequently becomes free of the first order update hyperparameters to tune. Our experiments on Cifar-10 and ImageNet show the state of the art black-box attack performance with significant reduction in the required queries compared to a number of recently proposed methods.

An Intelligent SDWN Routing Algorithm Based on Network Situational Awareness and Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state update mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Yong Wang, Hongbing Qiu, Xiaofang Deng, Linqiang Huang, Miao Ye, Jinqiang Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the highly dynamic changes in wireless network topologies, efficiently obtaining network status information and flexibly forwarding data to improve communication quality of service are important challenges. This article introduces an intelligent routing algorithm (DRL-PPONSA) based on proximal policy optimization deep reinforcement learning with network situational awareness under a software-defined wireless networking architecture. First, a specific data plane is designed for network topology construction and data forwarding. The control plane collects network traffic information, sends flow tables, and uses a GCN-GRU prediction mechanism to perceive future traffic change trends to achieve network situational awareness. Second, a DRL-based data forwarding mechanism is designed in the knowledge plane. The predicted network traffic matrix and topology information matrix are treated as the environment for DRL agents, while next-hop adjacent nodes are treated as executable actions. Accordingly, action selection strategies are designed for different network conditions to achieve more intelligent, flexible, and efficient routing control. The reward function is designed using network link information and various reward and penalty mechanisms. Additionally, importance sampling and gradient clipping techniques are employed during gradient updating to enhance convergence speed and stability. Experimental results show that DRL-PPONSA outperforms traditional routing methods in network throughput, delay, packet loss rate, and wireless node distance. Compared to value-function-based Dueling DQN routing, the convergence speed is significantly improved, and the convergence effect is more stable. Simultaneously, its consumption of hardware storage space is reduced, and efficient routing decisions can be made in real-time using the current network state information.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on efficient state update mechanisms, hardware optimization, memory bandwidth utilization, and cache-friendly implementations, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Algorithms\n- **Structured Matrices and State Space Models (SSMs):** Research has shown that using structured matrices and SSMs can significantly improve computation and memory efficiency. For example, the use of butterfly matrices and linear state-space layers (LSSLs) can enable efficient \\(O(N \\log N)\\) computation while maintaining expressiveness. These models, when combined with hardware-aware designs, can be 2.8\u00d7 faster and save 86.8% GPU memory[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Bandwidth Utilization\n- **Optimized Memory Access Patterns:** Efficient memory access patterns are crucial for performance. Structured matrices and careful structuring of the model can optimize memory access, leading to better cache utilization. For instance, models like S4D and S5, which consider a purely diagonal structure, improve computational efficiency and allow for better channel communication[Analysis Note].\n\n## Cache-Friendly Implementations\n- **Cache Efficiency in SSMs:** Cache-friendly algorithms are essential for efficient state update mechanisms. Linear State-Space Layers (LSSLs) and other SSMs can be designed to optimize cache utilization, which is critical for practical performance. These designs ensure that the model's memory access patterns are aligned with the hardware's capabilities, reducing memory bandwidth usage and improving overall efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Practical Performance Metrics\n- **Performance Metrics and Benchmarks:** When evaluating the performance of these models, it is important to consider metrics such as computation time, memory usage, and accuracy. For example, models that combine SSMs with attention mechanisms have shown significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarks like the AlgoPerf benchmark can be used to compare the convergence speed and efficiency of different optimizers and algorithms.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Integration with Attention Mechanisms:** Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms has shown promise in improving the performance of autoregressive language models. This integration can enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and improve overall accuracy[Analysis Note].\n- **Optimizers and Preconditioning:** Using advanced optimizers like Shampoo, which store preconditioners, can help in faster convergence and better utilization of hardware resources. These optimizers can be particularly beneficial when combined with hardware-aware designs.\n\n## Future Directions\n- **Hardware-Optimized Matrix Multiplication:** Research into hardware-optimized matrix multiplication algorithms, such as those using structured matrices and diagonal structures, can further improve the efficiency of state updates in autoregressive models.\n- **Memory Bandwidth Optimization Techniques:** Techniques to optimize memory bandwidth, such as careful structuring of the model and optimizing memory access patterns, are crucial for achieving high performance.\n- **Integration Strategies:** Developing strategies to integrate attention mechanisms with SSMs efficiently will be key to improving the overall performance and scalability of autoregressive language models.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage hardware optimization, efficient state update mechanisms, and cache-friendly implementations.\n",

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2.

This new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension) many patterns, converges with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. The number of stored patterns is traded off against convergence speed and retrieval error. The new Hopfield network has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. Transformer and BERT models operate in their first layers preferably in the global averaging regime, while they operate in higher layers in metastable states. The gradient in transformers is maximal for metastable states, is uniformly distributed for global averaging, and vanishes for a fixed point near a stored pattern. Using the Hopfield network interpretation, we analyzed learning of transformer and BERT models. Learning starts with attention heads that average and then most of them switch to metastable states. However, the majority of heads in the first layers still averages and can be replaced by averaging, e.g. our proposed Gaussian weighting. In contrast, heads in the last layers steadily learn and seem to use metastable states to collect information created in lower layers. These heads seem to be a promising target for improving transformers. Neural networks with Hopfield networks outperform other methods on immune repertoire classification, where the Hopfield net stores several hundreds of thousands of patterns. We provide a new PyTorch layer called \"Hopfield\", which allows to equip deep learning architectures with modern Hopfield networks as a new powerful concept comprising pooling, memory, and attention.

We have introduced a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and the corresponding new update rule. This network can store exponentially many patterns, retrieves patterns with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. We analyzed the attention heads of BERT models. The new modern Hopfield networks have been integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. Hopfield layers that equip neural network layers with memories improved state-of-the-art in three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems and on immune repertoire classification, and on two drug design dataset. They yielded the best results among different machine learning methods on the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe ELLIS Unit Linz, the LIT AI Lab and the Institute for Machine Learning are supported by the Land Ober\u00f6sterreich, LIT grants DeepToxGen (LIT-2017-3-YOU-003), and AI-SNN (LIT2018-6-YOU-214), the Medical Cognitive Computing Center (MC3), Janssen Pharmaceutica, UCB Biopharma, Merck Group, Audi.JKU Deep Learning Center, Audi Electronic Venture GmbH, TGW, Primal, S3AI (FFG-872172), Silicon Austria Labs (SAL), Anyline, FILL, EnliteAI, Google Brain, ZF Friedrichshafen AG, Robert Bosch GmbH, T\u00dcV Austria, DCS, and the NVIDIA Corporation.

State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Carmen Amo Alonso, Jerome Sieber, M. Zeilinger*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective is provided, and a comparative analysis of these models is presented, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear state-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation models. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n#### 4. Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/46 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02311.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Structured Denoising Diffusion Models in Discrete State-Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Jacob Austin, Daniel D. Johnson, Jonathan Ho, Daniel Tarlow, Rianne van den Berg*\n\n**TL;DR:** D3PMs are diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities and showing that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) (Ho et al. 2020) have shown impressive results on image and waveform generation in continuous state spaces. Here, we introduce Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs), diffusion-like generative models for discrete data that generalize the multinomial diffusion model of Hoogeboom et al. 2021, by going beyond corruption processes with uniform transition probabilities. This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. For text, this model class achieves strong results on character-level text generation while scaling to large vocabularies on LM1B. On the image dataset CIFAR-10, our models approach the sample quality and exceed the log-likelihood of the continuous-space DDPM model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 647  (*Influential: 100*)\n\n#### 2. Tree-structured Attention with Hierarchical Accumulation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Xuan-Phi Nguyen, Shafiq R. Joty, S. Hoi, R. Socher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper attempts to bridge the gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity, and demonstrates that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage.\n\n**Abstract:** Incorporating hierarchical structures like constituency trees has been shown to be effective for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, it is evident that state-of-the-art (SOTA) sequence-based models like the Transformer struggle to encode such structures inherently. On the other hand, dedicated models like the Tree-LSTM, while explicitly modeling hierarchical structures, do not perform as efficiently as the Transformer. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap with Hierarchical Accumulation to encode parse tree structures into self-attention at constant time complexity. Our approach outperforms SOTA methods in four IWSLT translation tasks and the WMT'14 English-German task. It also yields improvements over Transformer and Tree-LSTM on three text classification tasks. We further demonstrate that using hierarchical priors can compensate for data shortage, and that our model prefers phrase-level attentions over token-level attentions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 75  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 3. MapTR: Structured Modeling and Learning for Online Vectorized HD Map Construction\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Bencheng Liao, Shaoyu Chen, Xinggang Wang, Tianheng Cheng, Qian Zhang, Wenyu Liu, Chang Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach is proposed, i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process.\n\n**Abstract:** High-definition (HD) map provides abundant and precise environmental information of the driving scene, serving as a fundamental and indispensable component for planning in autonomous driving system. We present MapTR, a structured end-to-end Transformer for efficient online vectorized HD map construction. We propose a unified permutation-equivalent modeling approach, i.e., modeling map element as a point set with a group of equivalent permutations, which accurately describes the shape of map element and stabilizes the learning process. We design a hierarchical query embedding scheme to flexibly encode structured map information and perform hierarchical bipartite matching for map element learning. MapTR achieves the best performance and efficiency with only camera input among existing vectorized map construction approaches on nuScenes dataset. In particular, MapTR-nano runs at real-time inference speed ($25.1$ FPS) on RTX 3090, $8\\times$ faster than the existing state-of-the-art camera-based method while achieving $5.0$ higher mAP. Even compared with the existing state-of-the-art multi-modality method, MapTR-nano achieves $0.7$ higher mAP, and MapTR-tiny achieves $13.5$ higher mAP and $3\\times$ faster inference speed. Abundant qualitative results show that MapTR maintains stable and robust map construction quality in complex and various driving scenes. MapTR is of great application value in autonomous driving.

Structural Entropy Guided Graph Hierarchical Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Junran Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Ke Xu, Shangzhe Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, and a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once, which outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of convolution on non-Euclidean space, the corresponding pooling approaches have also been validated on various tasks regarding graphs. However, because of the fixed compression quota and stepwise pooling design, these hierarchical pooling methods still suffer from local structure damage and suboptimal problem. In this work, inspired by structural entropy, we propose a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, to tackle the two issues. Specifically, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once. Then, we present an illustration of the local structure damage from previous methods in the reconstruction of ring and grid synthetic graphs. In addition to SEP, we further design two classification models, SEP-G and SEP-N for graph classification and node classification, respectively. The results show that SEP outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Nonlinear Structural Equation Model Guided Gaussian Mixture Hierarchical Topic Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Hegang Chen, Pengbo Mao, Yuyin Lu, Yanghui Rao*\n\n**TL;DR:** NSEM-GMHTM is proposed as a deep topic model, with a Gaussian mixture prior distribution to improve the model\u2019s ability to adapt to sparse data, which explicitly models hierarchical and symmetric relations between topics through the dependency matrices and nonlinear structural equations.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical topic models, which can extract semantically meaningful topics from a textcorpus in an unsupervised manner and automatically organise them into a topic hierarchy, have been widely used to discover the underlying semantic structure of documents. However, the existing models often assume in the prior that the topic hierarchy is a tree structure, ignoring symmetrical dependenciesbetween topics at the same level. Moreover, the sparsity of text data often complicate the analysis. To address these issues, we propose NSEM-GMHTM as a deep topic model, witha Gaussian mixture prior distribution to improve the model\u2019s ability to adapt to sparse data, which explicitly models hierarchical and symmetric relations between topics through the dependency matrices and nonlinear structural equations. Experiments on widely used datasets show that our NSEM-GMHTM generates more coherent topics and a more rational topic structure when compared to state-of-theart baselines.

Intrinsic-Extrinsic Convolution and Pooling for Learning on 3D Protein Structures\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state processing structured matrices*\n\n*Barbora Kozl\u00edkov\u00e1, Pere Pau V\u00e1zquez, Mat\u011bj Lang, Marco Sch\u00e4fer, Tobias Ritschel, Pedro Hermosilla, Michael Krone, Timo Ropinski, Gloria Fackelmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Proteins perform a large variety of functions in living organisms, thus playing a key role in biology. As of now, available learning algorithms to process protein data do not consider several particularities of such data and/or do not scale well for large protein conformations. To fill this gap, we propose two new learning operations enabling deep 3D analysis of large-scale protein data. First, we introduce a novel convolution operator which considers both, the intrinsic (invariant under protein folding) as well as extrinsic (invariant under bonding) structure, by using $n$-D convolutions defined on both the Euclidean distance, as well as multiple geodesic distances between atoms in a multi-graph. Second, we enable a multi-scale protein analysis by introducing hierarchical pooling operators, exploiting the fact that proteins are a recombination of a finite set of amino acids, which can be pooled using shared pooling matrices. Lastly, we evaluate the accuracy of our algorithms on several large-scale data sets for common protein analysis tasks, where we outperform state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Conference:** intrinsic-extrinsic-convolution-and-pooling\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical state processing, structured matrices, and the specified analysis points, here are some key insights and references that can be useful:\n\n## State Update Mechanisms\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Implementing hierarchical structures can help balance efficiency and expressiveness. For example, using bidirectional state space models (SSMs) as in \"Vision Mamba\" can be effective for long sequence modeling. This approach leverages SSMs to efficiently process states in a hierarchical manner, which can be adapted for autoregressive language models.\n- **Selective Attention Mechanisms**: Combining SSMs with selective attention mechanisms can enhance the efficiency of state updates. This is seen in \"Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention,\" where a divide-and-conquer approach for linear attention maintains global abstraction and data-dependent selection, which can be applied to hierarchical state processing.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Utilization\n- **Structured Matrices and Cache-Friendly Implementations**: Using structured matrices and cache-friendly implementations can significantly improve memory efficiency. Techniques like tiling and blocking, as mentioned in \"FlashAttention,\" reduce memory reads/writes and optimize cache utilization. These strategies can be integrated into the memory hierarchy of autoregressive models to enhance performance.\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: IO-aware algorithms, such as those described in \"Simple linear attention language models,\" can enable higher throughput by optimizing memory access patterns. This is crucial for efficient memory hierarchy utilization in autoregressive models.\n\n## Training Stability\n- **Efficient Initialization and Training Strategies**: For stable training, it is essential to focus on efficient initialization and training strategies. This can involve using techniques that ensure the stability of the learning process, such as those discussed in the context of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which address the vanishing gradient problem through mechanisms like forget gates.\n- **Hardware-Aware Algorithm Design**: Designing algorithms that are aware of the hardware capabilities can help in maintaining training stability. This includes optimizing computations and memory access patterns to align with the hardware, as highlighted in the references provided.\n\n## Performance Metrics\n- **Efficiency and Expressiveness Trade-off**: The performance of autoregressive models can be evaluated based on their ability to balance efficiency and expressiveness. Hierarchical processing and structured matrices can help in achieving this balance. For instance, \"Vision Mamba\" demonstrates a 2.8\u00d7 speedup and 86.8% GPU memory savings, indicating improved efficiency without compromising expressiveness.\n- **Throughput and Memory Efficiency**: Metrics such as throughput and memory efficiency are crucial. IO-aware algorithms and cache-friendly implementations can significantly improve these metrics, as seen in \"FlashAttention\" and \"Simple linear attention language models\".\n\n## Integration Techniques for Structured Matrices\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)**: Integrating SSMs with autoregressive models can be beneficial. SSMs can be designed to be hardware-efficient and can handle long sequences effectively, which is essential for hierarchical state processing.\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Implementing linear attention mechanisms in a divide-and-conquer manner, as in \"Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention,\" can help in integrating structured matrices efficiently while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and leveraging the insights from the referenced works, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Score: 0.90)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Spectral State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Naman Agarwal, Daniel Suo, Xinyi Chen, Elad Hazan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/28 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv: $2307.08691,2023$. $\\left[\\mathrm{DDH}^{+}\\right.$22] Damai Dai, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Zhifang Sui, Baobao Chang, and Furu Wei.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices neural networks*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 3. Overcoming Oscillations in Quantization-Aware Training\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms neural networks*\n\n*Markus Nagel, Marios Fournarakis, Yelysei Bondarenko, Tijmen Blankevoort*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper delves deeper into the phenomenon of weight oscillations and shows that it can lead to a significant accuracy degradation due to wrongly estimated batch-normalization statistics during inference and increased noise during training.\n\n**Abstract:** When training neural networks with simulated quantization, we observe that quantized weights can, rather unexpectedly, oscillate between two grid-points. The importance of this effect and its impact on quantization-aware training (QAT) are not well-understood or investigated in literature. In this paper, we delve deeper into the phenomenon of weight oscillations and show that it can lead to a significant accuracy degradation due to wrongly estimated batch-normalization statistics during inference and increased noise during training. These effects are particularly pronounced in low-bit ($\\leq$ 4-bits) quantization of efficient networks with depth-wise separable layers, such as MobileNets and EfficientNets. In our analysis we investigate several previously proposed QAT algorithms and show that most of these are unable to overcome oscillations. Finally, we propose two novel QAT algorithms to overcome oscillations during training: oscillation dampening and iterative weight freezing. We demonstrate that our algorithms achieve state-of-the-art accuracy for low-bit (3&4 bits) weight and activation quantization of efficient architectures, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3, and EfficentNet-lite on ImageNet.

Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), is suggested utilizing the proposed generalization bound, and experimental results show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 5.

This motivates algorithmically optimizing the architectural constraints imposed by equivariance. We propose the equivariance relaxation morphism, which preserves functionality while reparameterizing a group equivariant layer to operate with equivariance constraints on a subgroup, as well as the [G]-mixed equivariant layer, which mixes layers constrained to different groups to enable within-layer equivariance optimization. We further present evolutionary and differentiable neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms that utilize these mechanisms respectively for equivariance-aware architectural optimization.

Our framework is based on gating the output of GNN layers with a mechanism for multi-rate flow of message passing information across nodes of the underlying graph. Local gradients are harnessed to further modulate message passing updates. Our framework flexibly allows one to use any basic GNN layer as a wrapper around which the multi-rate gradient gating mechanism is built. We rigorously prove that G$^2$ alleviates the oversmoothing problem and allows the design of deep GNNs.

Selective Annotation Makes Language Models Better Few-Shot Learners\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates gating*\n\n*Hongjin Su, Jungo Kasai, Chen Henry Wu, Weijia Shi, Tianlu Wang, Jiayi Xin, Rui Zhang, Mari Ostendorf, Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Tao Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work forms an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time, and proposes an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotation.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent approaches to natural language tasks are built on the remarkable abilities of large language models. Large language models can perform in-context learning, where they learn a new task from a few task demonstrations, without any parameter updates. This work examines the implications of in-context learning for the creation of datasets for new natural language tasks. Departing from recent in-context learning methods, we formulate an annotation-efficient, two-step framework: selective annotation that chooses a pool of examples to annotate from unlabeled data in advance, followed by prompt retrieval that retrieves task examples from the annotated pool at test time. Based on this framework, we propose an unsupervised, graph-based selective annotation method, voke-k, to select diverse, representative examples to annotate. Extensive experiments on 10 datasets (covering classification, commonsense reasoning, dialogue, and text/code generation) demonstrate that our selective annotation method improves the task performance by a large margin. On average, vote-k achieves a 12.9%/11.4% relative gain under an annotation budget of 18/100, as compared to randomly selecting examples to annotate. Compared to state-of-the-art supervised finetuning approaches, it yields similar performance with 10-100x less annotation cost across 10 tasks. We further analyze the effectiveness of our framework in various scenarios: language models with varying sizes, alternative selective annotation methods, and cases where there is a test data domain shift. We hope that our studies will serve as a basis for data annotations as large language models are increasingly applied to new tasks.

RoAST: Robustifying Language Models via Adversarial Perturbation with Selective Training\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates gating*\n\n*Jaehyung Kim, Yuning Mao, Rui Hou, Hanchao Yu, Davis Liang, Pascale Fung, Qifan Wang, Fuli Feng, Lifu Huang, Madian Khabsa*\n\n**TL;DR:** Under a unified evaluation of fine-tuned LMs by incorporating four representative perspectives of model robustness, the effectiveness of RoAST is demonstrated compared to state-of-the-art fine- tuning methods on six different types of LMs, which indicates its usefulness in practice.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (LMs) has become the de facto standard in many NLP tasks. Nevertheless, fine-tuned LMs are still prone to robustness issues, such as adversarial robustness and model calibration. Several perspectives of robustness for LMs have been studied independently, but lacking a unified consideration in multiple perspectives. In this paper, we propose Robustifying LMs via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training (RoAST), a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to enhance the multi-perspective robustness of LMs in a unified way. RoAST effectively incorporates two important sources for the model robustness, robustness on the perturbed inputs and generalizable knowledge in pre-trained LMs. To be specific, RoAST introduces adversarial perturbation during fine-tuning while the model parameters are selectively updated upon their relative importance to minimize unnecessary deviation. Under a unified evaluation of fine-tuned LMs by incorporating four representative perspectives of model robustness, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RoAST compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on six different types of LMs, which indicates its usefulness in practice.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices neural networks*\n\n*Hun-Seok Kim, Changwoo Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to Continually Learn\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates gating*\n\n*Nick Cheney, Thomas Miconi, Shawn Beaulieu, Joel Lehman, Lapo Frati, Kenneth O. Stanley, Jeff Clune*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual lifelong learning requires an agent or model to learn many sequentially ordered tasks, building on previous knowledge without catastrophically forgetting it. Much work has gone towards preventing the default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN. ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Unifying and Personalizing Weakly-supervised Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Adaptive Representation and Aggregation\n\n*From Search Query: selective state updates gating*\n\n*Xiaoying Tang, Kenneth K. Y. Wong, Yixiang Liu, Jiewei Wu, Li Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) enables multiple sites to collaboratively train powerful deep models without compromising data privacy and security. The statistical heterogeneity (e.g., non-IID data and domain shifts) is a primary obstacle in FL, impairing the generalization performance of the global model. Weakly supervised segmentation, which uses sparsely-grained (i.e., point-, bounding box-, scribble-, block-wise) supervision, is increasingly being paid attention to due to its great potential of reducing annotation costs. However, there may exist label heterogeneity, i.e., different annotation forms across sites. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework for medical image segmentation, named FedICRA, which uniformly leverages heterogeneous weak supervision via adaptIve Contrastive Representation and Aggregation. Concretely, to facilitate personalized modeling and to avoid confusion, a channel selection based site contrastive representation module is employed to adaptively cluster intra-site embeddings and separate inter-site ones. To effectively integrate the common knowledge from the global model with the unique knowledge from each local model, an adaptive aggregation module is applied for updating and initializing local models at the element level. Additionally, a weakly supervised objective function that leverages a multiscale tree energy loss and a gated CRF loss is employed to generate more precise pseudo-labels and further boost the segmentation performance. Through extensive experiments on two distinct medical image segmentation tasks of different modalities, the proposed FedICRA demonstrates overwhelming performance over other state-of-the-art personalized FL methods. Its performance even approaches that of fully supervised training on centralized data.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nChung et al. 2014) as well as more modern variants such as the QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), SRU (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017), RWKV (B. Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants. This framework yields insights on how recent SSMs (e.g. Mamba) perform as well as Transformers on language modeling. Moreover, our theoretical tools provide new ideas to improve SSMs (and potentially Transformers) by connecting the algorithmic and systems advances on both sides. As a demonstration, the framework guides our design of a new architecture (Mamba-2) at the intersection of SSMs and structured attention. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Angela Wu for the suggestion on how to efficiently compute the gradient of $\\Delta$ in a numerically stable manner.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.44)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2978-2988, 2019.

Learning Infinite-Horizon Average-Reward Restless Multi-Action Bandits via Index Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms state processing*\n\n*Guojun Xiong, Shu-Fan Wang, J. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes novel index policies to address dimensionality concerns and develops two low-complexity index-aware RL algorithms, namely, GM-R2MAB, which has access to a generative model; and UC-R2MAB, which learns the model using an upper con\ufb01dence style online exploitation method, which achieves a sub-linear regret that is only polynomial in the number of arms and states.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the online restless bandits with average-reward and multiple actions, where the state of each arm evolves according to a Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the current state of the corresponding MDP and the action taken. Since \ufb01nding the optimal control is typically intractable for restless bandits, existing learning algorithms are often computationally expensive or with a regret bound that is exponential in the number of arms and states. In this paper, we advocate index-aware reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to design RL algorithms operating on a much smaller dimensional subspace by exploiting the inherent structure in restless bandits. Speci\ufb01cally, we \ufb01rst propose novel index policies to address dimensionality concerns, which are provably optimal. We then leverage the indices to develop two low-complexity index-aware RL algorithms, namely, (i) GM-R2MAB , which has access to a generative model; and (ii) UC-R2MAB , which learns the model using an upper con\ufb01dence style online exploitation method. We prove that both algorithms achieve a sub-linear regret that is only polynomial in the number of arms and states. A key differentiator between our algorithms and existing ones stems from the fact that our RL algorithms contain a novel exploitation that leverages our proposed provably optimal index policies for decision-makings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Geometry-Aware Gradient Algorithms for Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: IO-aware algorithms state processing*\n\n*Liam Li, M. Khodak, Maria-Florina Balcan, Ameet Talwalkar*\n\n**TL;DR:** A geometry-aware framework is presented that exploits the underlying structure of this optimization to return sparse architectural parameters, leading to simple yet novel algorithms that enjoy fast convergence guarantees and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the latest NAS benchmarks in computer vision.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent state-of-the-art methods for neural architecture search (NAS) exploit gradient-based optimization by relaxing the problem into continuous optimization over architectures and shared-weights, a noisy process that remains poorly understood. We argue for the study of single-level empirical risk minimization to understand NAS with weight-sharing, reducing the design of NAS methods to devising optimizers and regularizers that can quickly obtain high-quality solutions to this problem. Invoking the theory of mirror descent, we present a geometry-aware framework that exploits the underlying structure of this optimization to return sparse architectural parameters, leading to simple yet novel algorithms that enjoy fast convergence guarantees and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the latest NAS benchmarks in computer vision. Notably, we exceed the best published results for both CIFAR and ImageNet on both the DARTS search space and NAS-Bench-201; on the latter we achieve near-oracle-optimal performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. Together, our theory and experiments demonstrate a principled way to co-design optimizers and continuous relaxations of discrete NAS search spaces.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we propose to learn an ensemble by leveraging existing methods in a relation-aware manner. However, exploring these semantics using relation-aware ensemble leads to a much larger search space than general ensemble methods. To address this issue, we propose a divide-search-combine algorithm RelEns-DSC that searches the relation-wise ensemble weights independently. This algorithm has the same computation cost as general ensemble methods but with much better performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in efficiently searching relation-aware ensemble weights and achieving state-of-the-art embedding performance.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 5. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices DenseStateProcessor*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices DenseStateProcessor*\n\n*Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices, and proposes a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which is shown to be better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly matrices in language models*\n\n*Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Yandong Wen, Songyou Peng, Juyeon Heo, Zhen Liu, Haiwen Feng, Longhui Yu, Yuxuan Xue, Yuliang Xiu, Yao Feng, Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large foundation models are becoming ubiquitous, but training them from scratch is prohibitively expensive. Thus, efficiently adapting these powerful models to downstream tasks is increasingly important. In this paper, we study a principled finetuning paradigm -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) -- for downstream task adaptation. Despite demonstrating good generalizability, OFT still uses a fairly large number of trainable parameters due to the high dimensionality of orthogonal matrices. To address this, we start by examining OFT from an information transmission perspective, and then identify a few key desiderata that enable better parameter-efficiency. Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, we propose an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures. We apply this parameterization to OFT, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT). By subsuming OFT as a special case, BOFT introduces a generalized orthogonal finetuning framework. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical study of adapting large vision transformers, large language models, and text-to-image diffusion models to various downstream tasks in vision and language.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: Butterfly matrices in language models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates several advanced techniques, here are some key areas and specific information that can be gathered:\n\n### Structured Matrix Operations\n\n#### Butterfly Matrices\n- **Implementation Details**: Look for papers or implementations that demonstrate how Butterfly matrices can be integrated into the state processing unit of language models.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/67 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:4271-4282, 2020.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33: $1474-1487,2020 \\mathrm{a}$.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/31 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nPeng, B., Goldstein, D., Anthony, Q., Albalak, A., Alcaide, E., Biderman, S., Cheah, E., Du, X., Ferdinan, T., Hou, H., Kazienko, P., GV, K.

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Structured Neural Networks for Density Estimation and Causal Inference\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrix implementation in neural networks*\n\n*Asic Q. Chen, Ruian Shi, Xiang Gao, Ricardo Baptista, Rahul G. Krishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Structured Neural Network (StrNN), which injects structure through masking pathways in a neural network, is proposed, which opens up new avenues for learning neural networks that enable data-efficient generative modeling and the use of normalizing flows for causal effect estimation.\n\n**Abstract:** Injecting structure into neural networks enables learning functions that satisfy invariances with respect to subsets of inputs. For instance, when learning generative models using neural networks, it is advantageous to encode the conditional independence structure of observed variables, often in the form of Bayesian networks. We propose the Structured Neural Network (StrNN), which injects structure through masking pathways in a neural network. The masks are designed via a novel relationship we explore between neural network architectures and binary matrix factorization, to ensure that the desired independencies are respected. We devise and study practical algorithms for this otherwise NP-hard design problem based on novel objectives that control the model architecture. We demonstrate the utility of StrNN in three applications: (1) binary and Gaussian density estimation with StrNN, (2) real-valued density estimation with Structured Autoregressive Flows (StrAFs) and Structured Continuous Normalizing Flows (StrCNF), and (3) interventional and counterfactual analysis with StrAFs for causal inference. Our work opens up new avenues for learning neural networks that enable data-efficient generative modeling and the use of normalizing flows for causal effect estimation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrix implementation in neural networks*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Equivariant Matrix Function Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrix implementation in neural networks*\n\n*Ilyes Batatia, Lars L. Schaaf, Huajie Chen, G'abor Cs'anyi, Christoph Ortner, Felix A. Faber*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially message-passing neural networks (MPNNs), have emerged as powerful architectures for learning on graphs in diverse applications. However, MPNNs face challenges when modeling non-local interactions in graphs such as large conjugated molecules, and social networks due to oversmoothing and oversquashing. Although Spectral GNNs and traditional neural networks such as recurrent neural networks and transformers mitigate these challenges, they often lack generalizability, or fail to capture detailed structural relationships or symmetries in the data. To address these concerns, we introduce Matrix Function Neural Networks (MFNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes non-local interactions through analytic matrix equivariant functions. Employing resolvent expansions offers a straightforward implementation and the potential for linear scaling with system size. The MFN architecture achieves stateof-the-art performance in standard graph benchmarks, such as the ZINC and TU datasets, and is able to capture intricate non-local interactions in quantum systems, paving the way to new state-of-the-art force fields.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Boost Transformer-based Language Models with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware support for structured sparsity*\n\n*Chong Yu, Tao Chen, Zhongxue Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Along with the performance improvement in NLP domain, the sizes of transformer-based language models ( TLM ) are also dramatically increased. Some prior works intend to compress TLM models into more compact forms, but do not fully consider the hardware characters may not support the efficient execution for these forms, leading to the deployment of TLM on hardware with noticeable acceleration is still challenging. This paper thoroughly designs a compression scheme named GPUSQ-TLM to maximally utilize the GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization characters . Especially, a dense TLM model is first pruned to meet the GPU\u2019s acceleration constraint of sparse patterns with FP16 type, then it is further quantized into a fixed-point one by quantization-aware training, to provide an extra speedup for integer tensors on GPU. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation of labels, logits and feature maps is used for best accuracy compensation during pruning and quantization process. Experiment results show GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-TLM can boost actual deployment performance by up to 4.08-4.25 \u00d7 times latency and 6.18-6.79 \u00d7 throughput on A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Accelerating Sparse Convolution with Column Vector-Wise Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: hardware support for structured sparsity*\n\n*Yijun Tan, Kai Han, Kang Zhao, Xianzhi Yu, Zidong Du, Yunji Chen, Yunhe Wang, Jun Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an algorithm-software co-designed sparse convolution based on a novel out-vector-wise (OVW) sparse pattern that treats a V \u00d7 1 vector as unit and begins to obtain speedups on data with only 10% sparsity.\n\n**Abstract:** Weight sparsity is a promising approach to reducing the model size and computation cost of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Nevertheless, non-zero weights often distribute randomly in sparse CNN models, introducing enormous dif\ufb01culty in obtaining actual speedup on common hardware (e.g., GPU) over their dense counterparts. Existing acceleration solutions either require hardware modi\ufb01cations for irregular memory access support or rely on a partially structured sparsity pattern. Neither of these methods is capable of achieving fruitful speedup on convolution layers. In this work, we propose an algorithm-software co-designed sparse convolution based on a novel out-vector-wise (OVW) sparse pattern. Building on the insight that vertical vector integrity can preserve continuous memory access in IM2COL, the OVW pattern treats a V \u00d7 1 vector as unit. To reduce the error caused by sparsity, we propose an equivalent transformation process, i.e., clustering-based channel permutation, to gather similar rows together. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves a 1 . 7 \u00d7 and 3 . 2 \u00d7 speedup over the SOTA solution and the dense convolution of ResNet50 on NVIDIA V100 at 75% sparsity, respectively, with only negligible accuracy loss. Moreover, compared to the SOTA solution that achieves speedups only on data with 60% sparsity or more, our method begins to obtain speedups on data with only 10% sparsity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Towards Efficient Deep Spiking Neural Networks Construction with Spiking Activity based Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware support for structured sparsity*\n\n*Yaxin Li, Qi Xu, Jiangrong Shen, Hongming Xu, Long Chen, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework, Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, which indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibiting high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need for compressing network models due to the presence of a significant number of redundant structural units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power consumption and biological interpretability advantages. Currently, most model compression techniques for SNNs are based on unstructured pruning of individual connections, which requires specific hardware support. Hence, we propose a structured pruning approach based on the activity levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network pruning framework. Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically adjusts the network's structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels during training, enhancing the model's adaptation to the current target task. While maintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture, ultimately reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process. This indicates that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Towards Faster Training of Global Covariance Pooling Networks by Iterative Matrix Square Root Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrix implementation in neural networks*\n\n*Zilin Gao, Peihua Li, Jiangtao Xie, Qilong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Global covariance pooling in convolutional neural networks has achieved\nimpressive improvement over the classical first-order pooling. Recent works\nhave shown matrix square root normalization plays a central role in achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods depend heavily on\neigendecomposition (EIG) or singular value decomposition (SVD), suffering from\ninefficient training due to limited support of EIG and SVD on GPU. Towards\naddressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root\nnormalization method for fast end-to-end training of global covariance pooling\nnetworks. At the core of our method is a meta-layer designed with loop-embedded\ndirected graph structure. The meta-layer consists of three consecutive\nnonlinear structured layers, which perform pre-normalization, coupled matrix\niteration and post-compensation, respectively.

Training Transformers with 4-bit Integers\n\n*From Search Query: hardware support for structured sparsity*\n\n*Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen, Changhao Li, Haocheng Xi*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantizing the activation, weight, and gradient to 4-bit is promising to accelerate neural network training. However, existing 4-bit training methods require custom numerical formats which are not supported by contemporary hardware. In this work, we propose a training method for transformers with all matrix multiplications implemented with the INT4 arithmetic. Training with an ultra-low INT4 precision is challenging. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the specific structures of activation and gradients in transformers to propose dedicated quantizers for them. For forward propagation, we identify the challenge of outliers and propose a Hadamard quantizer to suppress the outliers. For backpropagation, we leverage the structural sparsity of gradients by proposing bit splitting and leverage score sampling techniques to quantize gradients accurately. Our algorithm achieves competitive accuracy on a wide range of tasks including natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Unlike previous 4-bit training methods, our algorithm can be implemented on the current generation of GPUs. Our prototypical linear operator implementation is up to 2.2 times faster than the FP16 counterparts and speeds up the training by up to 35.1%.\n\n**Conference:** training-transformers-with-4-bit-integers\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Flash-LLM: Enabling Cost-Effective and Highly-Efficient Large Generative Model Inference with Unstructured Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: hardware support for structured sparsity*\n\n*Shuaiwen Leon Song, Wei Lin, Yong Li, Xiafei Qiu, Zhongzhu Zhou, Donglin Zhuang, Yuchao Li, Zhen Zheng, Haojun Xia*\n\n**Abstract:** With the fast growth of parameter size, it becomes increasingly challenging to deploy large generative models as they typically require large GPU memory consumption and massive computation. Unstructured model pruning has been a common approach to reduce both GPU memory footprint and the overall computation while retaining good model accuracy. However, the existing solutions do not provide a highly-efficient support for handling unstructured sparsity on modern GPUs, especially on the highly-structured Tensor Core hardware. Therefore, we propose Flash-LLM for enabling low-cost and highly-efficient large generative model inference with the sophisticated support of unstructured sparsity on high-performance but highly restrictive Tensor Cores. Based on our key observation that the main bottleneck of generative model inference is the several skinny matrix multiplications for which Tensor Cores would be significantly under-utilized due to low computational intensity, we propose a general Load-as-Sparse and Compute-as-Dense methodology for unstructured sparse matrix multiplication. The basic insight is to address the significant memory bandwidth bottleneck while tolerating redundant computations that are not critical for end-to-end performance on Tensor Cores. Based on this, we design an effective software framework for Tensor Core based unstructured SpMM, leveraging on-chip resources for efficient sparse data extraction and computation/memory-access overlapping. At SpMM kernel level, Flash-LLM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art library, i.e., Sputnik and SparTA by an average of 2.9x and 1.5x, respectively. At end-to-end framework level on OPT-30B/66B/175B models, for tokens per GPU-second, Flash-LLM achieves up to 3.8x and 3.6x improvement over DeepSpeed and FasterTransformer, respectively, with significantly lower inference cost.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 5. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with adaptive compression*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Residual Dense Network for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with adaptive compression*\n\n*Yu Kong, Yulun Zhang, Yapeng Tian, Bineng Zhong, Yun Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural network has recently achieved great success for image restoration (IR) and also offered hierarchical features. However, most deep CNN based IR models do not make full use of the hierarchical features from the original low-quality images, thereby achieving relatively-low performance. In this paper, we propose a novel residual dense network (RDN) to address this problem in IR. We fully exploit the hierarchical features from all the convolutional layers. Specifically, we propose residual dense block (RDB) to extract abundant local features via densely connected convolutional layers. RDB further allows direct connections from the state of preceding RDB to all the layers of current RDB, leading to a contiguous memory mechanism. To adaptively learn more effective features from preceding and current local features and stabilize the training of wider network, we proposed local feature fusion in RDB. After fully obtaining dense local features, we use global feature fusion to jointly and adaptively learn global hierarchical features in a holistic way. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RDN with several representative IR applications, single image super-resolution, Gaussian image denoising, image compression artifact reduction, and image deblurring. Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show that our RDN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods for each IR task quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas to focus on and the most useful information to gather:\n\n### Structured Matrix Operations\n\n**Objective:** Integrate structured matrices (e.g., Butterfly and Monarch matrices) to improve computational efficiency and hardware utilization.\n\n**Useful Information:**\n- **Implementation Details:**\n  - Search for case studies or implementation guides on how to integrate Butterfly and Monarch matrices within neural network state processors.
