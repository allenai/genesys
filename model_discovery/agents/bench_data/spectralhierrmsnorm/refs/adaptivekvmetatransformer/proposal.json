Introduction**\n\nThe proposal, **AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer**, aims to enhance the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models by integrating adaptive layer-wise Key-Value (KV) cache management and adaptive sparse attention mechanisms into the MetaLearner Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU). The primary objectives are to reduce memory usage and computational overhead during inference, particularly for long sequences, without compromising model performance.\n\n---\n\n**2. Clarity**\n\nThe proposal is **clearly articulated**, with well-defined objectives and detailed explanations of the motivations behind each component. The design plan specifies the selected GAU to modify (MetaLearner) and provides a comprehensive overview of the proposed modifications, including mathematical formulations and pseudo-code implementations. The inclusion of implementation guidelines demonstrates a thorough understanding of the practical considerations involved.\n\n---\n\n**3. Innovation**\n\n**Novelty**: The integration of adaptive layer-wise KV cache management and adaptive sparse attention mechanisms into the MetaLearner GAU appears to be a **novel approach**. While adaptive KV cache management and sparse attention methods have been explored separately in existing research, combining both within the MetaLearner architecture represents a unique contribution.\n\n**Comparison with Existing Research**: The proposal aligns with current research trends focused on improving efficiency and scalability in large language models. Methods like **Loki** and **RetrievalAttention** address similar challenges but do not integrate these adaptive mechanisms within the MetaLearner framework. The proposal extends the capabilities of MetaLearner GAU by incorporating meta-learning strategies for dynamic adaptation, which is not directly addressed in prior works.\n\n---\n\n**4. Feasibility**\n\nThe proposed design is **feasible** within the given framework. The modifications are grounded in established techniques, and the pseudo-code provides a clear pathway for implementation. Potential challenges, such as computational overhead from importance estimation and relevance scoring, are acknowledged, and solutions like using lightweight models for scoring functions are suggested. The design leverages existing components of the MetaLearner GAU, facilitating integration.\n\n---\n\n**5. Scalability**\n\nThe proposal addresses **scalability** by reducing memory consumption through selective KV caching and computational overhead via adaptive sparse attention. These mechanisms are particularly beneficial for long sequences and larger models, as they mitigate the quadratic complexity associated with traditional attention mechanisms. By optimizing resource usage, the design is expected to scale efficiently with increasing model sizes and data volumes.\n\n---\n\n**6. Accuracy and Robustness**\n\nThe adaptive mechanisms aim to maintain or improve model performance by focusing computational resources on the most relevant layers and tokens. By selectively storing critical KV caches and attending to the most relevant tokens, the model could potentially achieve lower perplexity and higher accuracy on downstream tasks. However, there is a potential risk of performance degradation if important information is discarded during the adaptation process. The proposal acknowledges this and suggests careful tuning of thresholds and considerations for maintaining performance.\n\n---\n\n**7. Efficiency**\n\nThe design offers significant potential improvements in computational efficiency and memory usage:\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Adaptive KV cache management reduces memory consumption by selectively storing KV caches at layers deemed important, which is crucial for deep models and long sequences.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Adaptive sparse attention reduces the number of computations by focusing attention on a subset of relevant tokens, lowering the computational overhead during inference.\n- **Inference Latency**: By optimizing memory usage and computations, the proposal could lead to faster inference times and reduced Time to First Token (TTFT).\n\n---\n\n**8. Strengths and Concerns**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Novel Integration**: The combination of adaptive KV cache management and adaptive sparse attention within the MetaLearner GAU is a unique contribution that addresses key efficiency challenges.\n- **Alignment with Research Trends**: The proposal aligns with ongoing efforts to optimize large language models for efficiency and scalability.\n- **Comprehensive Design**: The proposal provides detailed mathematical formulations, pseudo-code, and implementation guidelines, demonstrating thoroughness and a clear implementation path.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Integrating adaptive mechanisms into the MetaLearner GAU may introduce complexity in the architecture and training process.\n- **Computational Overhead**: The added computations for importance estimation and relevance scoring may offset some efficiency gains if not efficiently implemented.\n- **Training Stability**: The introduction of adaptive components may affect training stability, requiring careful tuning and potential modifications to optimization strategies.\n- **Performance Trade-offs**: There's a risk that discarding KV caches or tokens deemed unimportant may lead to a loss in model performance if not properly managed.\n\n---\n\n**9. Suggestions for Improvement**\n\n- **Empirical Validation**: Provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modifications, including benchmarks comparing performance, memory usage, and inference times against baseline models.\n- **Efficiency Optimization**: Explore efficient algorithms or approximations for importance estimation and relevance scoring to minimize computational overhead.\n- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Consider making the thresholds for importance estimation (e.g., `importance_threshold`, `top_k_ratio`) learnable parameters or dynamically adjusted based on the input or model state.\n- **Training Strategies**: Implement training techniques to ensure stability, such as gradient norm clipping, adaptive learning rates, or regularization methods.\n- **Assessment of Trade-offs**: Analyze the impact of the adaptive mechanisms on model performance, ensuring that efficiency gains do not come at the cost of significant accuracy loss.\n\n---\n\n**10. Final Rating**\n\nBased on the comprehensive analysis, the proposal is well-thought-out, addresses significant challenges in scaling autoregressive language models, and introduces novel contributions by integrating adaptive mechanisms into the MetaLearner GAU. The potential benefits in efficiency and scalability are substantial, and the proposal aligns with current research trends. However, empirical validation and careful implementation are crucial to assess the practical impact and address potential concerns.\n\n```rating 4.2```\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe **AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer** proposal offers an innovative approach to enhancing the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models by integrating adaptive KV cache management and adaptive sparse attention into the MetaLearner GAU. The design is clear, novel, feasible, and potentially impactful. With careful implementation, empirical validation, and addressing the raised concerns, it could contribute valuable advancements to the field of language modeling.\n\n---",

Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule.

After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan.

However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence length.

Central to LLM is the attention mechanism [62], which computes interactions among tokens within a certain span, thereby enabling context understanding. Scaling input length is crucial for enhancing LLM capabilities [7, 60], including fact retrieval, summarization, few-shot learning, question answering and so on [4, 70]. However, the ever-growing attention computation and KeyValue Cache (KV-Cache) pose significant efficiency challenges [54, 69, 26, 33]. Previous work proposes sparse attention methods to address the efficiency challenges of long contexts in generative LLMs. These methods typically employ a uniform, fixed-span sliding window mask across all heads and input lengths, limiting attention to local contexts only [69, 26]. This approach allows the LLM to take long inputs with a fixed attention span, keeping bounded attention computation and KV caching overhead. Following previous works [7, 60], we quantify the effective context length\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_55b306f08bc2c02b2c4bg-02.jpg?height=402&width=1397&top_left_y=208&top_left_x=359)\n\nFigure 1: Retrieval accuracy of the Vicuna-7B model using different attention methods across varying input lengths and retrieval positions on the LongEval dataset. This \"Needle In a Haystack\" experiment [19] takes massive key-value pairs as inputs and tests the accuracy to retrieve values based on given keys from diverse positions. (a) Original model with a full attention span; (b) StreamingLLM with half the attention span, showing reduced effectiveness beyond the span; (c) MoA with half the attention span, maintaining effectiveness beyond the span. as the maximum input length where content retrieval accuracy exceeds a $90 \\%$ threshold. In principle, fixed-span local attention can gradually aggregate global information through multiple model layers, yielding a longer effective context length than each attention span [18]. Nonetheless, we reveal that uniform masks, like StreamingLLM [69], hardly extend effective context length beyond the span, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 1(b) further illustrates such limitation: with a $50 \\%$ attention span mask, StreamingLLM fails to accurately retrieve content from the earlier half of the input and performs even worse at longer input lengths. Figure 2 reveals one possible explanation for the problem: while some attention heads focus on local contexts, others encompass the broad span of the entire input sequence. Consequently, the uniform approach fails to achieve a long effective context length as it limits the attention span of the global-context heads, while excessively allocates compute and memory budget for local-context heads. Additionally, as the input length increases, some attention heads need a faster increase in attention span than others to avoid serious performance degradation, as shown in Table 1 Unfortunately, the uniform approaches do not include heterogeneous rules to scale the attention spans differently for various heads. Besides, existing model compression methods [44, 40, 68, 36, 31, 37] use general language modeling corpora to decide the compression plan, which cannot accurately profile the influence of compression on long-context tasks. In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention (MoA), a training-free sparse attention method. As illustrated in Figure 3 . MoA constructs the search space of heterogeneous elastic rules of attention spans. For automatic LLM compression, MoA first utilizes gradient-based profiling to inspect the influences of each attention position on the prediction loss. Based on the profiling results, MoA tailors heterogeneous sparse attention configurations for each model layer and attention head. During profiling, MoA employs a calibration dataset with long-range dependencies and uses the original dense model's response instead of the human-written response as the reference to calculate the loss.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Franz A.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

This capability is particularly significant in applications that demand deep understanding and synthesis of large volumes of information, such as summarization (Huang et al., 2021; Hu et al., 2023; Song et al., 2022; Kry\u015bci\u0144ski et al., 2021), reading comprehension (Nguyen et al., 2016; Fan et al., 2019; Zhong et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023), long-form generation (Guan et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2022; Roziere et al., 2023), and\n\n[^0]complex reasoning (Wei et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). However, it is challenging to extend the context window from different viewpoints: First, the predominant LLM model uses Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), GPT (OpenAI, 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020) employ full attention in each layer which inherently incurs quadratic time and memory complexity. This may potentially diminish the efficiency of both the training and inference processes. Second, attention computation over an extremely long sequence might lead to an almost even distribution, potentially causing the omission of vital information (Han et al., 2023). This may further lead to the issue of being \"lost in the middle\" (Liu et al., 2023). Finally, the distribution of training signals for long and short sequences is imbalanced. It is evident that longer sequences are infrequent in both plain text and instructiontuning data. Consequently, this rarity poses a challenge in effectively capturing long-term dependencies during the training process. To tackle the above issues, we propose to group local-global attention layers into blocks during the training and inference phases. This strategy enhances efficiency while yielding results comparable to those of a global attention Transformer. Notably, it attains equivalent performance levels with merely half the computational effort required for training. Additionally, this approach significantly reduces memory consumption during inference by maintaining a local Key-Value (K-V) cache specifically for the local attention layers. In Section 2.1, we list the two critical components essential for a long-context model as well as the potential alternatives for consideration. These encompass diverse attention mechanisms and methodologies for positional embedding. Subsequently, in Section 2.2, we conduct a comparative analysis of these alternatives, presenting their em-\npirical outcomes for a comprehensive evaluation. Integrating these insights, we name our model Zebra, drawing an analogy to the alternating black and white stripes of a zebra, which resemble the grouped local and global layers in our model's architecture. To validate the proposed model at large scales, Section 3 details the continuation of training the Llama-2-7B model (Touvron et al., 2023) using long-context adaptation training through Zebra. This approach not only exhibits comparable performance on short-sequence benchmarks but also achieves superior perplexity results for longer sequences. Additionally, in Section 4, we conduct fine-tuning of Zebra using a combination of both short and long instruction-tuning datasets. This is followed by a systematic evaluation of the model's performance across a range of benchmark datasets. It demonstrates generally better performance on both long and short benchmarks compared to Llama-2-7b-chat.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer.

SqueezeAttention: 2D Management of KV-Cache in LLM Inference via Layer-wise Optimal Budget\n\n*From Search Query: Layer-wise KV cache management*\n\n*Bin Cui, Shaoduo Gan, ZiHao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache of the Large Language Model (LLM) has been considered critical to saving the cost of inference. Most of the existing KV-cache compression algorithms attempted to sparsify the sequence of tokens by taking advantage of the different importance of tokens. However, most of these methods treat all layers equally, allocating the same KV budget to each layer. This approach is suboptimal, as some layers may be less sensitive to input tokens yet still receive the same budget as others. In this work, we found that by identifying the importance of attention layers, we could optimize the KV-cache jointly from two dimensions, i.e., sequence-wise and layer-wise. Based on our observations regarding layer-wise importance in inference, we propose SqueezeAttention to precisely optimize the allocation of KV-cache budget among layers on-the-fly and then incorporate three representative sequence-wise algorithms to compress the KV-cache for each layer with its very own budget. Specifically, we first measure each layer's importance by calculating the cosine similarity of the input prompt differences before and after the self-attention layers. Based on this similarity, we then categorize the layers into two groups and adjust their KV budgets accordingly. By optimizing the KV-cache from both sequence's and layer's dimensions, SqueezeAttention achieves around 30% to 70% of the memory reductions and up to 2.2 times of throughput improvements in a wide range of LLMs and benchmarks.

LayerKV: Optimizing Large Language Model Serving with Layer-wise KV Cache Management\n\n*From Search Query: Layer-wise KV cache management*\n\n*Zhenxuan Pan, Ke Zhang, Junping Zhao, Yuhong Guo, Rui Zhang, Ziqing Wang, Changxu Shao, Hao Wu, Yi Xiong*\n\n**Abstract:** The expanding context windows in large language models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced their capabilities in various applications, but they also introduce significant challenges in maintaining low latency, particularly in Time to First Token (TTFT). This paper identifies that the sharp rise in TTFT as context length increases is predominantly driven by queuing delays, which are caused by the growing demands for GPU Key-Value (KV) cache allocation clashing with the limited availability of KV cache blocks. To address this issue, we propose LayerKV, a simple yet effective plug-in method that effectively reduces TTFT without requiring additional hardware or compromising output performance, while seamlessly integrating with existing parallelism strategies and scheduling techniques. Specifically, LayerKV introduces layer-wise KV block allocation, management, and offloading for fine-grained control over system memory, coupled with an SLO-aware scheduler to optimize overall Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Comprehensive evaluations on representative models, ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, across various GPU configurations, demonstrate that LayerKV improves TTFT latency up to 69x and reduces SLO violation rates by 28.7%, significantly enhancing the user experience.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-learning in Transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-learning in Transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

Here are some relevant findings:\n\n- **SqueezeAttention**: This method optimizes the KV-cache budget among layers based on their importance, which is determined by clustering their cosine similarities during the prompt prefilling phase. It reallocates the cache budgets to important layers, ensuring better model performance with lower cache budgets and significant memory savings (up to 30-70%) and throughput improvements (up to 2.2 times).\n\n- **LayerKV and LazyKV**: These methods also focus on layer-wise KV cache management. LayerKV introduces layer-wise context mining to optimize decoding efficiency, while LazyKV updates only a subset of the KV cache during decoding, reducing memory usage and computation.\n\n### Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\nTo reduce computational complexity, the researcher aims to integrate adaptive sparse attention mechanisms:\n\n- **Longformer and Routing Transformers**: These models use local windowed attention combined with task-motivated global attention (Longformer) or content-based sparse attention (Routing Transformers), which reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear or near-linear. These approaches can be adapted to dynamically select relevant tokens based on content relevance or importance.\n\n### Meta-Learning in Transformers\n\nThe integration of meta-learning techniques is crucial for adaptability:\n\n- **Meta-Learning with Transformers**: Studies have shown that Transformers can be adapted to new tasks with minimal updates through meta-learning. This involves using the model to learn how to learn, enabling it to adapt attention mechanisms based on input context.\n\n### Hierarchical and Context-Adaptive Encoding\n\nFor better handling of long sequences, the researcher is interested in hierarchical and context-adaptive positional encoding:\n\n- **CAPE (Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding)**: This method introduces multi-scale positional encodings that capture both local and global positional information, allowing the model to generalize to longer sequences than those seen during training.\n\n### Key Insights and Next Steps\n\n1. **Novelty Verification**:\n   - Ensure that the combination of adaptive layer-wise KV cache management, adaptive sparse attention, and meta-learning within the 'MetaLearner' GAU is novel by conducting thorough literature reviews.\n\n2. **Prototype Development**:\n   - Implement a prototype integrating SqueezeAttention or similar layer-wise KV cache management methods.\n   - Incorporate adaptive sparse attention mechanisms like those in Longformer or Routing Transformers.\n   - Enhance the 'ContextAdaptiveEncoder' with hierarchical positional encoding.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation**:\n   - Test the modified model on benchmark datasets to evaluate performance improvements and efficiency gains.\n   - Compare with baseline models and existing methods to demonstrate advantages.\n\n4. **Address Potential Challenges**:\n   - Monitor for any potential issues with training convergence or stability due to the modifications.\n   - Ensure that the importance estimation and adaptive mechanisms do not introduce significant computational overhead.\n\n5. **Optimization**:\n   - Explore hardware-aware optimizations to maximize efficiency, possibly leveraging specialized hardware features or optimized libraries like those discussed in the QServe and ZipCache papers.\n\n### Useful References\n\n- **SqueezeAttention**: For layer-wise KV cache management and its integration with sequence-wise compression algorithms.\n- **Longformer and Routing Transformers**: For adaptive sparse attention mechanisms.\n- **CAPE**: For context-adaptive positional encoding.\n- **QServe and ZipCache**: For quantization and optimization techniques that can further enhance the efficiency of the proposed model.\n\nBy integrating these components, the researcher can create a novel LM block that optimizes memory usage, reduces computational complexity, and enhances the model's ability to handle long sequences, potentially outperforming current state-of-the-art models.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate $k$ NN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262 K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time. ## 1 INTRODUCTION\n\nTransformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have led to remarkable progress in natural language processing (Devlin et al.||2019|, Brown et al., 2020), mathematical reasoning (Polu \\& Sutskever, 2020, Wang et al., 2020a; Rabe et al., 2021;, Li et al., 2021; Hahn et al., 2021; Cobbe et al., 2021), and program synthesis (Austin et al., 2021; Chen et al.| 2021; Li et al.| 2022). However, transformer performance on many of these tasks is limited by the context length of attention, which is typically short. The ability to attend to far-away tokens is important in many situations. In novels, characters and events are referenced across multiple chapters. In source code, references to classes and functions may occur quite far from the places in which they are defined. In theorem proving, proofs make use of previously defined lemmas. Attention over long sequences is also useful as a form of rapid learning. Facts and information which are stored in the form of weight matrices must be slowly trained over hundreds of thousands of training steps. By using attention, however, a model can simply memorize facts (e.g. function definitions) by storing them as (key, value) pairs in long-term memory, and then retrieve those facts later by creating a query that attends to them. In this case, attention acts as a form of information retrieval, allowing the model to look up facts that it has seen previously. We demonstrate that a simple and effective way to increase the size of the attention context is to use approximate $k$-nearest-neighbor ( $k \\mathrm{NN})$ lookup, which is widely used in information retrieval. A number of extremely scalable implementations of $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup are available, such as ScaNN Guo et al., 2020) and Faiss (Johnson et al. 2021). There are two things which distinguish our approach from previous work on long-range attention (c.f. Section 22. First, unlike some other approaches, $k$ NN lookup does not do averaging or summarization of tokens at long distances, but retrieves exact values even from the distant context. Second, gradients are not backpropagated into the external memory, which is critical to the scalability of our technique. The keys and values are a function of model parameters, so attempting to backpropagate gradients into external memory would necessarily involve computing all of the keys and values with the current model parameters on every training step. However, if the external memory is not differentiable, then we can instead instead reuse keys and values that were previously computed on prior training steps, which drastically reduces the amount of computation for large memories. With\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1ef7ca414da07969fba6g-02.jpg?height=405&width=660&top_left_y=285&top_left_x=727)\n\nFigure 1: Adding a memory of 8 K tokens improves perplexity across different model sizes. our technique, we are easily able to scale external memory up to sequence lengths of 131 k or 262 k tokens on a single TPU device, while maintaining a reasonable step time. We show that model perplexity steadily improves with the size of external memory on a variety of language modelling tasks, including C 4 (long documents only), Github code repositories, PG-19 books, formal proofs in Isabelle, and arXiv math papers. We further show that models can generalize to larger memory sizes than they were trained on: models trained with a small memory show gains from using a much larger memory at inference time. Finally, we show that our models are actually using memory in the way that we had hoped, e.g. by looking up the definitions of lemmas in a theorem proving corpus. The simplicity of the changes to the Transformer architecture allows us to easily integrate this approach into existing code bases, including extremely large language models. We further show that the improvements to quality are maintained across models of increasing size, and that the model improvements gained from adding memory are even larger than increasing the size of the model by 5 X or more as shown in Figure 1\n\n## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nA great deal of work has been done on efficient long-range attention mechanisms; see Tay et al. (2020, 2021) recent surveys. Sliding windows (Beltagy et al. 2020) use a long sequence, but attend within a smaller window, thus reducing complexity to the window size, rather than total sequence length. Approximate mechanisms such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020b), and Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) refactor the attention matrix by using a different kernel than softmax to obtain $O(N)$ complexity. Pooling strategies such as Hierarchical 1D attention (Zhu \\& Soricut 2021), and Combiner (Ren et al. 2021) apply pooling or averaging over tokens at longer distances. Sparse strategies such as Big Bird (Zaheer et al. 2020) select only a subset of tokens to attend to; Routing Transformers (Roy et al., 2021) use clustering to select the subset, while Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020) relies on hashing. Hierarchical mechanisms (Ainslie et al., 2020) combine multiple tokens into phrases or sentences to reduce sequence length. Expire-span (Sukhbaatar et al., 2021) prunes far-away tokens that it learns are \"unimportant\". Zemlyanskiy et al., 2021) process long sequences in two passes with different encoders. The second pass is given a lot of context by accessing summaries of the first pass. Feedback transformers (Fan et al. 2020) use a recurrent architecture in which each token attends to the output of the final layer instead of the previous layer. Recurrence does not increase the size of the attention context itself, but it expands the receptive field at the cost of parallelism and training speed. Truncated backpropagation through time (Williams \\& Peng, 1990) was originally introduced as a way of training recurrent neural networks (RNN) over very long sequences, when the entire sequence does not fit in memory. The sequence is chopped into segments, and after each training step, the final RNN state for the segment is saved in a non-differentiable cache, and used as the initial state on the next training step. Neural caches Grave et al. 2017) extend the cache to contain a record of many prior hidden states, and attend over them. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) applies this technique to transformers; it caches the (key,value) pairs computed from the previous training step, and uses them as a prefix for the tokens on the next training step, which yields significant gains on long documents. Rae et al. (2020) improve over Transformer-XL by compressing the tokens before adding them to the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1ef7ca414da07969fba6g-03.jpg?height=665&width=1052&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=512)\n\nFigure 2: We extend Transformers with access to (key, value) pairs of previously seen subsequences. cache. In contrast, we use a very large cache without compression, combined with an approximate $k \\mathrm{NN}$ attention mechanism over it. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) make the observation that the feed-forward portion of a transformer layer functions very much like attention if one replaces the ReLU activation with softmax. They implement a combined attention over both tokens from the input sequence and a learned (and differentiable) \"memory\". Lample et al. (2019) exploit this observation to replace the feed-forward layers (FFNs) with a fast $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup over a much larger \"memory\", and achieve large gains in model accuracy without significant computation overhead. (We use $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to approximate attention to previous tokens, not to replace the FFN.)\n\nNon-differentiable external memory has been used in different ways by Khandelwal et al. (2020), who run a pre-trained model over an entire corpus, and construct a large table of (key, token) pairs. They then use that table to replace the final softmax layer for token selection in the model, which results in significant improvements in language modeling. Yogatama et al. (2021) extend this approach by a gating mechanism and a process to compress the context into keys for retrieval. There are several works that combine retrieval with transformers. REALM (Guu et al., 2020), MARGE (Lewis et al., 2020a), RAG (Lewis et al. 2020b), and composite memory for dialog (Fan et al. 2021) retrieve documents from a knowledge base to improve question answering or dialogue. The knowledge base consists of text snippets and is static and typically separate from the inputs and outputs of the models. Instead, we focus on language modeling using a decoder-only model, and propose a simple model that unifies attention and retrieval. $k$-nearest-neighbor lookup is a general-purpose technique that is used for a wide variety of machine learning and retrieval tasks, and high-performance implementations are available for various architectures (Johnson et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2020). Memory-efficient Transformers (Gupta et al, 2021) replace dense attention with a $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to increase speed and reduce memory usage. ## 3 METHOD\n\nThe architecture of our $k \\mathrm{NN}$-augmented transformer is shown in Figure 2 The bulk of the model is a vanilla, decoder-only transformer (Vaswani et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 4. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

The primary challenge lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length, leading to substantial computational time and memory requirements [4, 41, 21]. To address this challenge, several approaches have been proposed. Longformer and BigBird utilize combinations of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, reducing complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$ [4, 41]. Reformer introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thereby reducing computational complexity [21]. LSG Attention combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead [9]. Despite these advancements, managing long-context interactions in practical applications remains a significant challenge. Recent work, such as LongLoRA, extends the context window of LLaMA2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens using Position Interpolation without substantial GPU or TPU resources\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-02.jpg?height=535&width=1381&top_left_y=404&top_left_x=365)\n\nFigure 1: Evaluation of SinkLoRA in bridging the accuracy gap between sparse shifted attention and full attention during supervised fine-tuning, while maintaining the memory efficiency of LongLoRA, which utilizes 1.8 times less memory compared to full fine-tuning.

However, LongLoRA's efficiency is limited, achieving only $39 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention due to chaotic attention head structures and unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, we propose SinkLoRA, which offers better work partitioning. This includes the development of Sink Fixed Attention (SF-Attn), a segmentation and reassembly algorithm that, along with the global attention of \"sink attention tokens,\" achieves $92 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement of full attention after fine-tuning. Additionally, we apply a state-of-the-art KV cache compression algorithm, Heavy Hitter Oracle $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right)$, to accelerate inference [43, 16, 25]. We further enhanced SinkLoRA through supervised fine-tuning using our self-collected LongAlpacaPlus dataset, comprising 28,000 entries from various sources, including Natural Questions, RedPajama [8], Book Summarization, and LongQA [6], ensuring a diverse and comprehensive collection for long instruction tuning. In summary, the contributions of our work are as follows:\n\n- We present SinkLoRA, a memory-efficient and effective method to extend the context length of LLaMA2 and LLaMA3, representing a complete update of LongLoRA. This method improves fine-tuning efficiency and offers a flexible deployment inference strategy. - We introduce SF-Attn, a fine-tuning method that combines a segmentation \\& reassembly algorithm and global attention. This method is easy to implement, accurate, and memoryefficient, without increasing computational complexity. By directly modifying the attention pattern, SF-Attn effectively redistributes attention scores, reducing the undue emphasis on initial tokens across different token groups. - We achieve efficient deployment of computationally intensive large language models (LLMs) in production environments by using the Heavy Hitter Oracle $\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}\\right) \\mathrm{KV}$ caching method.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design and implement a novel autoregressive language model block, termed **AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer**, which integrates adaptive layer-wise Key-Value (KV) cache management and adaptive sparse attention mechanisms within the MetaLearner GAU architecture.

This can be integrated into the MetaLearner GAU to focus attention computation on the most relevant tokens.\n\n#### Meta-Learning Strategies\n- **MetaAdapter** and **SimAdapter**:\n  - While these works apply meta-learning in transformer architectures to enhance adaptability, the specific application to dynamically adjust KV caching and attention mechanisms within the MetaLearner GAU is unique. However, insights from these works can be valuable in designing the adaptive components.\n\n#### Implementation Considerations\n- **Computational Overhead**:\n  - Efficient algorithms for importance estimation and relevance scoring are crucial.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle).

S-LoRA: Serving Thousands of Concurrent LoRA Adapters\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive kv cache management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Kurt Keutzer, Lianmin Zheng, Banghua Zhu, Christopher Chou, Shuo Yang, Nicholas Lee, Coleman Hooper, Dacheng Li, Shiyi Cao, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"pretrain-then-finetune\" paradigm is commonly adopted in the deployment of large language models. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, is often employed to adapt a base model to a multitude of tasks, resulting in a substantial collection of LoRA adapters derived from one base model. We observe that this paradigm presents significant opportunities for batched inference during serving. To capitalize on these opportunities, we present S-LoRA, a system designed for the scalable serving of many LoRA adapters. S-LoRA stores all adapters in the main memory and fetches the adapters used by the currently running queries to the GPU memory. To efficiently use the GPU memory and reduce fragmentation, S-LoRA proposes Unified Paging. Unified Paging uses a unified memory pool to manage dynamic adapter weights with different ranks and KV cache tensors with varying sequence lengths. Additionally, S-LoRA employs a novel tensor parallelism strategy and highly optimized custom CUDA kernels for heterogeneous batching of LoRA computation. Collectively, these features enable S-LoRA to serve thousands of LoRA adapters on a single GPU or across multiple GPUs with a small overhead. Compared to state-of-the-art libraries such as HuggingFace PEFT and vLLM (with naive support of LoRA serving), S-LoRA can improve the throughput by up to 4 times and increase the number of served adapters by several orders of magnitude. As a result, S-LoRA enables scalable serving of many task-specific fine-tuned models and offers the potential for large-scale customized fine-tuning services.

Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 4. Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

For instance, methods like LayerKV and LazyKV have been explored in other contexts, but their application within a meta-learning framework like the MetaLearner GAU could be unique[3|.\n- Reviewing existing works such as those on task adaptation for transformers (e.g., PETAH) can provide insights into how adaptive mechanisms have been used in other domains, which could inform the design of the AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer.\n\n## Impact on Efficiency and Scalability\n- **Adaptive KV Cache Management**: This approach can significantly reduce memory usage by selectively storing only the most critical KV caches at each layer. This is analogous to the concept of task adaptation in hybrid transformers, where only certain layers are adapted to improve efficiency[3|.\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: By focusing attention computation on the most relevant tokens, this mechanism can lower computational costs during inference, especially for long sequences. This aligns with the efficiency improvements seen in models like the Swin Transformer, which uses shifted window-based self-attention to reduce computational overhead.\n\n## Implementation Feasibility\n- Implementing these adaptive mechanisms within the MetaLearner GAU may involve complexities such as ensuring that the adaptive methods do not adversely affect accuracy or introduce instability during training. The integration with other components like AdaptiveLinearAttention and ContextAdaptiveEncoder needs careful consideration to maintain overall model performance.\n- The use of multi-head attention and position-wise feed-forward networks in transformers provides a framework that can be adapted for these mechanisms. For example, the multi-head attention mechanism in vision transformers can be modified to incorporate token relevance scoring for sparse attention.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Work\n- **LayerKV and LazyKV**: These methods have been used to optimize KV cache management in transformers. Comparing the performance and efficiency gains of these methods with the proposed AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer can provide valuable insights.\n- **Task Adaptation Methods**: Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) and attention finetuning, which are used in vision transformers, can serve as baselines to compare the efficiency and performance of the AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Novelty\n- The combination of adaptive KV cache management and adaptive sparse attention within a meta-learning framework is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both meta-learning and efficient transformer architectures.\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- **Selective KV Caching**: This can reduce memory usage significantly, similar to how task adaptation in hybrid transformers reduces parameters and computational costs[3|.\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention**: This mechanism can lower computational costs, similar to the shifted window-based self-attention in Swin Transformers, which reduces the quadratic cost of self-attention.\n\n### Potential Challenges\n- Ensuring that the adaptive mechanisms do not compromise model accuracy or stability is crucial. This might involve careful tuning of hyperparameters and ensuring that the adaptive methods align well with the existing components of the MetaLearner GAU.\n- The implementation should consider the interactions between the adaptive KV cache management, adaptive sparse attention, and other components like AdaptiveLinearAttention and ContextAdaptiveEncoder to maintain overall model performance.\n\n### Alignment with Current Research Trends\n- The proposal aligns with ongoing efforts to optimize large language models for efficiency and scalability, such as the use of hybrid models and task adaptation techniques in vision transformers.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### External Searches\n- Search for recent papers on adaptive KV cache management and sparse attention mechanisms in transformers, focusing on their application in meta-learning frameworks.\n- Look for studies on task adaptation methods in transformers and their impact on efficiency and performance.\n\n### Internal Library Searches\n- Search for internal documents and previous design proposals related to the MetaLearner GAU to identify any prior attempts to integrate similar adaptive mechanisms.\n- Review existing implementations of LayerKV, LazyKV, and other related methods to understand their strengths and limitations.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to design, implement, and evaluate the **AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer**, ensuring it meets the goals of improved efficiency, scalability, and performance in autoregressive language models.\n",

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022. Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kv cache transformers*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Fan Yang, Chen Chen, Kai Zhang, Bailu Ding, Chengruidong Zhang, Qi Chen, Qianxi Zhang, Zhenhua Han, Huiqiang Jiang, Baotong Lu, Meng Chen, Di Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. Retrieval Head Mechanistically Explains Long-Context Factuality\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic kv cache transformers*\n\n*Yao Fu, Hao Peng, Guangxuan Xiao, Yizhong Wang, Wenhao Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the recent progress in long-context language models, it remains elusive how transformer-based models exhibit the capability to retrieve relevant information from arbitrary locations within the long context. This paper aims to address this question. Our systematic investigation across a wide spectrum of models reveals that a special type of attention heads are largely responsible for retrieving information, which we dub retrieval heads. We identify intriguing properties of retrieval heads:(1) universal: all the explored models with long-context capability have a set of retrieval heads; (2) sparse: only a small portion (less than 5\\%) of the attention heads are retrieval. (3) intrinsic: retrieval heads already exist in models pretrained with short context. When extending the context length by continual pretraining, it is still the same set of heads that perform information retrieval. (4) dynamically activated: take Llama-2 7B for example, 12 retrieval heads always attend to the required information no matter how the context is changed. The rest of the retrieval heads are activated in different contexts. (5) causal: completely pruning retrieval heads leads to failure in retrieving relevant information and results in hallucination, while pruning random non-retrieval heads does not affect the model's retrieval ability. We further show that retrieval heads strongly influence chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, where the model needs to frequently refer back the question and previously-generated context. Conversely, tasks where the model directly generates the answer using its intrinsic knowledge are less impacted by masking out retrieval heads. These observations collectively explain which internal part of the model seeks information from the input tokens. We believe our insights will foster future research on reducing hallucination, improving reasoning, and compressing the KV cache.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning sparse transformers*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. End-to-End Meta-Bayesian Optimisation with Transformer Neural Processes\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning sparse transformers*\n\n*Haitham Bou Ammar, Antoine Grosnit, Matthieu Zimmer, Alexandre Maraval*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-Bayesian optimisation (meta-BO) aims to improve the sample efficiency of Bayesian optimisation by leveraging data from related tasks. While previous methods successfully meta-learn either a surrogate model or an acquisition function independently, joint training of both components remains an open challenge. This paper proposes the first end-to-end differentiable meta-BO framework that generalises neural processes to learn acquisition functions via transformer architectures. We enable this end-to-end framework with reinforcement learning (RL) to tackle the lack of labelled acquisition data. Early on, we notice that training transformer-based neural processes from scratch with RL is challenging due to insufficient supervision, especially when rewards are sparse. We formalise this claim with a combinatorial analysis showing that the widely used notion of regret as a reward signal exhibits a logarithmic sparsity pattern in trajectory lengths. To tackle this problem, we augment the RL objective with an auxiliary task that guides part of the architecture to learn a valid probabilistic model as an inductive bias. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art regret results against various baselines in experiments on standard hyperparameter optimisation tasks and also outperforms others in the real-world problems of mixed-integer programming tuning, antibody design, and logic synthesis for electronic design automation.\n\n**Conference:** end-to-end-meta-bayesian-optimisation-with\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. Exploiting Adapters for Cross-lingual Low-resource Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive meta transformers*\n\n*Takahiro Shinozaki, Renjun Xu, Tao Qin, Jindong Wang, Yidong Wang, Han Zhu, Wenxin Hou*\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-lingual speech adaptation aims to solve the problem of leveraging multiple rich-resource languages to build models for a low-resource target language. Since the low-resource language has limited training data, speech recognition models can easily overfit. In this paper, we propose to use adapters to investigate the performance of multiple adapters for parameter-efficient cross-lingual speech adaptation. Based on our previous MetaAdapter that implicitly leverages adapters, we propose a novel algorithms called SimAdapter for explicitly learning knowledge from adapters. Our algorithm leverages adapters which can be easily integrated into the Transformer structure.MetaAdapter leverages meta-learning to transfer the general knowledge from training data to the test language. SimAdapter aims to learn the similarities between the source and target languages during fine-tuning using the adapters. We conduct extensive experiments on five-low-resource languages in Common Voice dataset. Results demonstrate that our MetaAdapter and SimAdapter methods can reduce WER by 2.98% and 2.55% with only 2.5% and 15.5% of trainable parameters compared to the strong full-model fine-tuning baseline. Moreover, we also show that these two novel algorithms can be integrated for better performance with up to 3.55% relative WER reduction.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve their goals, here are some key points and directions for finding the most relevant information:\n\n## Understanding the Goals and Intent\n\nThe researcher is aiming to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/25 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.00752, 2023.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Hutchins, Christian Szegedy*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 138  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext, math papers, books, code, as well as formal theorems (Isabelle).\n\n**Abstract:** Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large\n  Language Model Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive kv cache\" meta-learner transformers*\n\n*Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high\nmemory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference.\nWhile key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously\ncomputed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead.\nExisting KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically\ncompress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden\nstates, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size. Our\napproach offers an efficient, training-free Grouped-Query Attention paradigm\nthat can be seamlessly integrated into existing KV cache schemes.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-04T02:32:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive kv cache\" meta-learner transformers*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In\nConvolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a\nfixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference\nand fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV\npairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion\ntechnique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss\nof contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token\nintegration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels\nthat dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for\nbroad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for\nstraightforward \"drop-in\" integration without needing architectural\nmodifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate\nthat LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various\ncontext lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both\ninference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed\nup to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable\nperformance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791\ncompared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we\nalso effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of\nfixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire\nsequences.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-08T01:35:11Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-25T21:09:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. SKVQ: Sliding-window Key and Value Cache Quantization for Large Language\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic kv caching\" transformer efficiency*\n\n*Haojie Duanmu, Zhihang Yuan, Xiuhong Li, Jiangfei Duan, Xingcheng Zhang, Dahua Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) can now handle longer sequences of tokens,\nenabling complex tasks like book understanding and generating lengthy novels.\nHowever, the key-value (KV) cache required for LLMs consumes substantial memory\nas context length increasing, becoming the bottleneck for deployment. In this\npaper, we present a strategy called SKVQ, which stands for sliding-window KV\ncache quantization, to address the issue of extremely low bitwidth KV cache\nquantization. To achieve this, SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache in\norder to improve the similarity of channels in quantization groups, and applies\nclipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Additionally, SKVQ ensures\nthat the most recent window tokens in the KV cache are preserved with high\nprecision. This helps maintain the accuracy of a small but important portion of\nthe KV cache.SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy.\nOur evaluation on LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ surpasses previous quantization\napproaches, allowing for quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit\nvalues with minimal loss of accuracy. With SKVQ, it is possible to process\ncontext lengths of up to 1M on an 80GB memory GPU for a 7b model and up to 7\ntimes faster decoding.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-10T03:06:24Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-13T14:39:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning attention mechanisms\" transformers*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Tensorized Transformer for Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning attention mechanisms\" transformers*\n\n*Xindian Ma, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Nan Duan, Yuexian Hou, Dawei Song, Ming Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Latest development of neural models has connected the encoder and decoder\nthrough a self-attention mechanism. In particular, Transformer, which is solely\nbased on self-attention, has led to breakthroughs in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP) tasks. However, the multi-head attention mechanism, as a key\ncomponent of Transformer, limits the effective deployment of the model to a\nresource-limited setting. In this paper, based on the ideas of tensor\ndecomposition and parameters sharing, we propose a novel self-attention model\n(namely Multi-linear attention) with Block-Term Tensor Decomposition (BTD). We\ntest and verify the proposed attention method on three language modeling tasks\n(i.e., PTB, WikiText-103 and One-billion) and a neural machine translation task\n(i.e., WMT-2016 English-German). Multi-linear attention can not only largely\ncompress the model parameters but also obtain performance improvements,\ncompared with a number of language modeling approaches, such as Transformer,\nTransformer-XL, and Transformer with tensor train decomposition.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-24T08:28:37Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-06T13:53:14Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Implicitly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning attention mechanisms\" transformers*\n\n*Zhifang Sui, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei, Yaru Hao, Li Dong, Yutao Sun, Damai Dai*\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained language models have shown surprising in-context learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, its working mechanism still remains an open question. In this paper, we explain language models as meta-optimizers and understand in-context learning as implicit finetuning. Theoretically, we figure out that Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT first produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. We comprehensively compare the behaviors of in-context learning and explicit finetuning on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. Experimental results show that in-context learning behaves similarly to explicit finetuning from multiple perspectives. Inspired by the dual form between Transformer attention and gradient descent, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with gradient descent with momentum. The improved performance over vanilla attention further supports our understanding from another perspective, and more importantly, shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model design.

Transformers learn in-context by gradient descent\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning attention mechanisms\" transformers*\n\n*Max Vladymyrov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Alexander Mordvintsev, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Ettore Randazzo, Eyvind Niklasson, Johannes von Oswald*\n\n**Abstract:** At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.

However, as these models scale up and handle longer sequences, they face significant challenges:\n\n- **Memory Constraints**: Storing Key-Value (KV) caches for all layers during decoding leads to substantial memory consumption, especially detrimental for large models with deep architectures.\n- **Inference Latency**: High memory usage increases inference latency, affecting Time to First Token (TTFT) and overall responsiveness.\n- **Computational Complexity**: The quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism limits scalability, making it impractical for models to handle very long sequences efficiently.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose the **AdaptiveKVMetaTransformer**, which enhances the existing MetaLearner GAU by integrating:\n\n1. **Adaptive Layer-wise KV Cache Management**: Selectively storing KV caches at different layers based on their impact on the current input, reducing memory usage and latency.\n2. **Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Focusing computational resources on the most relevant tokens through dynamic token selection, reducing computational overhead.\n   \nThese modifications aim to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency without compromising model performance, enabling LMs to scale effectively with longer sequences and larger models.\n\n## Related Work\n\n1. **Layer-wise KV Cache Management**:\n\n   - **LayerKV (Zhao et al., 2023)** introduced a method to accelerate LLM decoding by layer-wise context mining, selectively storing KV caches based on their importance, significantly reducing TTFT.\n   - **LazyKV (Ren et al., 2021)** proposed updating only a subset of the KV cache during decoding, reducing memory usage and computation while maintaining performance.\n\n2. **Adaptive Sparse Attention**:\n\n   - **Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020)** combined local windowed attention with task-motivated global attention, reducing complexity from quadratic to linear for long documents.\n   - **Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021)** utilized content-based sparse attention, attending to relevant tokens and improving efficiency.\n\n3. **Meta-Learning in Transformers**:\n\n   - **Learning to Learn with Transformers (Ke et al., 2021)** explored how Transformers can adapt to new tasks with minimal updates using meta-learning, enhancing adaptability.\n\n4. **Context-Adaptive Encoding**:\n\n   - **CAPE (Zheng et al., 2023)** introduced context-adaptive positional encoding for length generalization, allowing models to handle sequences longer than those seen during training.\n\nOur proposal integrates these concepts within the MetaLearner GAU, creating a novel approach that leverages meta-learning for both adaptive KV cache management and sparse attention, enhancing efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Key Concepts and Philosophy\n\n- **Adaptive KV Cache Management**:\n\n  - **Challenge**: Storing KV caches at every layer leads to high memory usage and latency.\n  - **Solution**: By dynamically estimating the importance of KV caches at each layer, we can selectively store only the most critical ones, optimizing memory usage.\n\n- **Adaptive Sparse Attention**:\n\n  - **Challenge**: Traditional attention mechanisms have quadratic complexity, making them inefficient for long sequences.\n  - **Solution**: Implementing adaptive sparse attention allows the model to focus on the most relevant tokens, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\n1. **Importance Estimation for KV Caching**:\n\n   - For each layer \\( l \\), compute an importance score \\( s_l \\) based on the input \\( X_l \\):\n\n     \\[\n     s_l = \\sigma(W_{\\text{imp}} X_l + b_{\\text{imp}})\n     \\]\n\n     where \\( W_{\\text{imp}} \\) and \\( b_{\\text{imp}} \\) are learnable parameters, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid activation function.\n\n   - Decide to store the KV cache for layer \\( l \\) if \\( s_l \\) exceeds a threshold \\( \\theta \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\text{Cache}_l = \\begin{cases}\n     \\text{Store} & \\text{if } s_l > \\theta \\\\\n     \\text{Discard} & \\text{if } s_l \\leq \\theta\n     \\end{cases}\n     \\]\n\n2. **Adaptive Sparse Attention**:\n\n   - **Token Relevance Scores**:\n\n     Compute relevance scores \\( r_i \\) for each token \\( i \\):\n\n     \\[\n     r_i = f_{\\text{relevance}}(X_i)\n     \\]\n\n     where \\( f_{\\text{relevance}} \\) is a lightweight scoring function.\n\n   - **Top-K Token Selection**:\n\n     Select the top \\( k \\) tokens based on \\( r_i \\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathcal{S} = \\text{TopK}(r_i, k)\n     \\]\n\n   - **Sparse Attention Computation**:\n\n     Compute attention over the selected tokens:\n\n     \\[\n     Y = \\text{Softmax}\\left( \\frac{Q K_{\\mathcal{S}}^\\top}{\\sqrt{d}} \\right) V_{\\mathcal{S}}\n     \\]\n\n### Potential Trade-offs and Solutions\n\n- **Computational Overhead**:\n\n  - *Trade-off*: The importance estimation and relevance scoring add extra computations.\n  - *Solution*: Use lightweight models for scoring functions and possibly share parameters across layers.\n\n- **Risk of Performance Degradation**:\n\n  - *Trade-off*: Discarding important KV caches or tokens might harm performance.\n  - *Solution*: Carefully set thresholds \\( \\theta \\) and \\( k \\) based on validation performance; consider making them learnable parameters.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**:\n\n  - *Trade-off*: Integrating these adaptive mechanisms increases architectural complexity.\n  - *Solution*: Modular design within the MetaLearner GAU to encapsulate the added functionality.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection MetaLearner```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nThe **MetaLearner** GAU will be enhanced by integrating:\n\n1. **Adaptive Importance Estimation**:\n\n   -
