Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 49/54 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nW.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

[23]. However, the proof from the Koopman theory perspective only guarantees the existence of universal approximation. Our proof is a constructive proof which can be further generalized to study the approximation rate with respect to the hidden dimensions and network depths. Recurrent neural networks Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [24] are one of the most popular neural networks for sequence modelling. Various results have been established in RNNs approximation theory, see Sontag [25], Hanson et al. [13]. Apart from the universal approximation, the exponential decaying memory property is the notorious phenomenon in recurrent neural networks which prohibits the scale up of the models in terms of the sequence length [14, 26]. ## 6 Discussion\n\nIn Table 1 we compare the classical sequence models including RNN, TCN and attention-based transformer. The state-space model can be considered as an enhancement of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) due to its superior optimization and inference speed. Despite maintaining a similar network topology, inference cost, and memory pattern, it provides a more efficient and streamlined approach. The effort to extend the long-memory learning is also carried out in convolutional networks and attention-based transformers. Romero et al.

Despite TCN's inference cost is independent of sequence length, it depends on the kernel size $K$, which typically bears a similar scale to $T$. |  | RNN | TCN | Transformer |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Number of weights | $L m\\left(m+d_{\\text {input }}+d_{\\text {output }}\\right)$ | $L C K d_{\\text {input }}$ | $3 L m d_{\\text {input }}$ |\n| Single-step inference cost | $O(1)$ | $O(1)$ | $O\\left(T^{2}\\right)$ |\n| Memory pattern | exponential decay | low rank | no restriction |\n| Memory improved version | SSM | CKConv | Linear Transformer |\n\n## 7 Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we give a constructive proof for the universal approximation property of multi-layer state-space models. It is shown that the nonlinear recurrent activations in classical recurrent neural networks are not necessary when there are nonlinear activations across different hidden layers. This result implies state-space model is as powerful as the classical recurrent neural networks in the approximation sense. Furthermore, we study the memory decay in multi-layer state-space models, which is a notorious issue in classical recurrent neural networks. While empirical evidence suggests\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_706083d06458fba282eag-10.jpg?height=776&width=1056&top_left_y=344&top_left_x=491)\n\nFigure 6: Memory function of a randomly initialized S4. For each model, as the time increases, the memory function can be \"capped\" by a straight line, which indicate that the memories are decaying exponentially. Compared with Figure 5(d), the results indicate that the smart initialization from S4 provides the memory function with a slower decay. that state-space models do not experience significant memory decay, they nonetheless exhibit a memory pattern that decays exponentially in the asymptotic sense. Our research has exciting implications for future work in state-space models. By extending our work to the approximation rate of state-space models, we can obtain better understanding of state-space models' hypothesis space. Such result is important to further optimize the architecture in various real-world applications. We aim to unlock the full potential of state-space models by identifying the ideal network structure (including depth and hidden dimension) for specific tasks and applications. ## References\n\n[1] V.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: wavelet neural networks, hierarchical state space models, neural stability analysis\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive wavelet distillation from neural networks through interpretations\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*Wooseok Ha, Chandan Singh, F. Lanusse, E. Song, Song Dang, Kangmin He, S. Upadhyayula, Bin Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adapt wavelet distillation (AWD) is proposed, a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform and yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency. Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the context of respective domains.

As one of the key components for GNN design is to select a tailored spectral filter, we take the first step towards analyzing anomalies via the lens of the graph spectrum. Our crucial observation is the existence of anomalies will lead to the `right-shift' phenomenon, that is, the spectral energy distribution concentrates less on low frequencies and more on high frequencies. This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN). Indeed, BWGNN has spectral and spatial localized band-pass filters to better handle the `right-shift' phenomenon in anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BWGNN on four large-scale anomaly detection datasets.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. The alignment property of SGD noise and how it helps select flat minima: A stability analysis\n\n*From Search Query: neural stability analysis*\n\n*Lei Wu, Mingze Wang, Weijie J. Su*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively, otherwise SGD will escape from that minimum fast.\n\n**Abstract:** The phenomenon that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat minima has played a critical role in understanding the implicit regularization of SGD. In this paper, we provide an explanation of this striking phenomenon by relating the particular noise structure of SGD to its \\emph{linear stability} (Wu et al., 2018). Specifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with square loss. We prove that if a global minimum $\\theta^*$ is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F\\leq O(\\sqrt{B}/\\eta)$, where $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F, B,\\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from that minimum \\emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD, the sharpness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded \\emph{independently} of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining these results is exploiting the particular structure of SGD noise: The noise concentrates in sharp directions of local landscape and the magnitude is proportional to loss value. This alignment property of SGD noise provably holds for linear networks and random feature models (RFMs), and is empirically verified for nonlinear networks. Moreover, the validity and practical relevance of our theoretical findings are also justified by extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Fine-Grained Analysis of Stability and Generalization for Modern Meta Learning Algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: neural stability analysis*\n\n*Jiechao Guan, Y. Liu, Zhiwu Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that, under the independent episode environment assumption, the generalization bound of O (1 / \u221a n ) via algorithmic stability analysis is near optimal, and develops matching lower and upper stability bounds for meta learning algorithms with two types of loss functions.\n\n**Abstract:** The support/query episodic training strategy has been widely applied in modern meta learning algorithms. Supposing the n training episodes and the test episodes are sampled independently from the same environment, previous work has derived a generalization bound of O (1 / \u221a n ) for smooth non-convex functions via algorithmic stability analysis. In this paper, we provide fine-grained analysis of stability and generalization for modern meta learning algorithms by considering more general situations. Firstly, we develop matching lower and upper stability bounds for meta learning algorithms with two types of loss functions: (1) nonsmooth convex functions with \u03b1 -H\u00f6lder continuous subgradients ( \u03b1 \u2208 [0 , 1)) ; (2) smooth (including convex and non-convex) functions. Our tight stability bounds show that, in the nonsmooth convex case, meta learning algorithms can be inherently less stable than in the smooth convex case. For the smooth non-convex functions, our stability bound is sharper than the existing one, especially in the setting where the number of iterations is larger than the number n of training episodes. Secondly, we derive improved generalization bounds for meta learning algorithms that hold with high probability. Specifically, we first demonstrate that, under the independent episode environment assumption, the generalization bound of O (1 / \u221a n ) via algorithmic stability analysis is near optimal. To attain faster convergence rate, we show how to yield a deformed generalization bound of O (ln n/n ) with the curvature condition of loss functions. Finally, we obtain a generalization bound for meta learning with dependent episodes whose dependency relation is characterized by a graph. Experiments on regression problems are conducted to verify our theoretical results.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Provable Guarantees for Generative Behavior Cloning: Bridging Low-Level Stability and High-Level Behavior\n\n*From Search Query: neural stability analysis*\n\n*A. Block, Ali Jadbabaie, Daniel Pfrommer, Max Simchowitz, Russ Tedrake*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that with a suitable low-level stability guarantee and a powerful enough generative model as the authors' imitation learner, pure supervised behavior cloning can generate trajectories matching the per-time step distribution of essentially arbitrary expert trajectories in an optimal transport cost.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a theoretical framework for studying behavior cloning of complex expert demonstrations using generative modeling. Our framework invokes low-level controllers - either learned or implicit in position-command control - to stabilize imitation around expert demonstrations. We show that with (a) a suitable low-level stability guarantee and (b) a powerful enough generative model as our imitation learner, pure supervised behavior cloning can generate trajectories matching the per-time step distribution of essentially arbitrary expert trajectories in an optimal transport cost. Our analysis relies on a stochastic continuity property of the learned policy we call\"total variation continuity\"(TVC). We then show that TVC can be ensured with minimal degradation of accuracy by combining a popular data-augmentation regimen with a novel algorithmic trick: adding augmentation noise at execution time. We instantiate our guarantees for policies parameterized by diffusion models and prove that if the learner accurately estimates the score of the (noise-augmented) expert policy, then the distribution of imitator trajectories is close to the demonstrator distribution in a natural optimal transport distance. Our analysis constructs intricate couplings between noise-augmented trajectories, a technique that may be of independent interest. We conclude by empirically validating our algorithmic recommendations, and discussing implications for future research directions for better behavior cloning with generative modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Multi-level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*WangMeng Zuo, Wei Lian, Pengju Liu, Hongzhi Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** In computer vision, convolutional networks (CNNs) often adopts pooling to enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational complexity. However, pooling can cause information loss and thus is detrimental to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently, dilated filter has been proposed to trade off between receptive field size and efficiency. But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve better trade-off between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field. Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution (HR) feature maps. The proposed MWCNN can also be viewed as an improvement of dilated filter and a generalization of average pooling, and can be applied to not only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling operation. The experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed MWCNN for tasks such as image denoising, single image super-resolution, JPEG image artifacts removal and object classification.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 5.

ReStA is a variant of the popular representational similarity analysis (RSA) in cognitive neuroscience. While RSA can be used to compare representations in models, model components, and human brains, ReStA compares instances of the same model, while systematically varying single model parameter.

The paper on \"Wavelet-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (Wav-KAN)\" demonstrates how wavelet functions can be used as learnable activation functions to capture both high-frequency and low-frequency components of the input data. This approach can be adapted for sequence modeling by incorporating wavelet-based multiresolution analysis, as suggested in \"Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\".\n\n- Wavelet transforms can help in capturing multiscale trends in input sequences, which is crucial for sequence modeling tasks. This can be integrated into the existing selective state space models (SSMs) to enhance their ability to capture non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales.\n\n### Hierarchical Architectures in State Space Models\n\n- The idea of hierarchical architectures can be derived from the concept of multiresolution analysis provided by wavelet transforms. By combining selective SSMs with wavelet-based decomposition, you can create a hierarchical structure that captures information at various scales. This is similar to the hierarchical structure implied in the \"Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\" paper, where multiresolution convolution captures trends at different scales.\n\n- Implementing a hierarchical structure can also involve using techniques like chunk-based processing, as in the Mamba2 model, but with an added layer of wavelet-based decomposition to enhance the capture of multiscale trends.\n\n### Theoretical Analysis of Stability in Deep Neural Networks with State-Based Memory\n\n- The stability of deep neural networks, especially those with state-based memory like SSMs, is crucial. Theoretical foundations provided in \"Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models\" suggest that selective SSMs can capture non-linear interactions between tokens through a low-dimensional projection of the input signature. This provides a basis for stability analysis, as it implies that the hidden state is provably stable under certain conditions.\n\n- To further analyze stability, you can consider the properties of wavelet transforms, which are known for their ability to isolate significant patterns while discarding irrelevant noise. This property can enhance the robustness and stability of the model by reducing the impact of noise and ensuring that the model captures meaningful patterns at various scales.\n\n### Implementation Considerations and Future Directions\n\n- **Efficiency and Complexity**: The use of wavelet transforms and hierarchical structures should be balanced with the need to maintain efficient computational complexity. The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has an O(N) complexity, which is advantageous compared to other transforms like the FFT.\n\n- **Stability Across Sequence Lengths**: Ensuring stability across different sequence lengths involves analyzing the theoretical foundations of SSMs and the properties of wavelet transforms. This can be achieved by leveraging the selective mechanism in SSMs and the multiresolution analysis of wavelets to maintain consistent performance regardless of sequence length.\n\n- **Inter-Chunk Communication**: Enhancing inter-chunk communication through hierarchical structures can be achieved by integrating wavelet-based decomposition within the chunk-based processing framework of the Mamba2 model. This can help in capturing and propagating information more effectively across different chunks.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researchers can develop a more robust and efficient autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of wavelet transforms, hierarchical state space models, and rigorous stability analysis.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP), pages 4779-4783.

Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/37 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n120-131.

Our MUlTIRESLAYER has key advantages over this body of past work:\n\n- Architecture simplicity: The workhorse of our layer is simple dilated convolutions and linear transforms. - Efficient training: Our layer parallelizes easily across hardware accelerators implementing convolutions. - Parameter efficiency: Our layer reuses filters across the stack of depthwise dilated convolutions. Likewise, by leveraging an MRA structure, we start from a principled and interpretable framework for thinking about memory in sequence modeling. Furthermore, we can lean on the vast MRA literature for modeling generalizations, such as shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) for shift-invariant representation learning, scaling to multiple input dimensions, etc. Our empirical evaluation covers sequential image classification and autoregressive generative modeling (CIFAR-10), reasoning on syntax trees (ListOps), and multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (PTB-XL). We also note that our proposed MULTIRESCONVs can readily be applied and extended to other tasks such as representation learning and long-term forecasting. Likewise, although we focus on sequence analysis, the ideas we propose generalize to other data domains with multiresolution structure, such as images and videos. Exploring the application of MULTIRESLAYER in these settings is an exciting future direction. ## 2. Background: Wavelet Decompositions\n\nIn contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of Fourier transforms, wavelets provide a time-frequency analysis. In particular, wavelets are a finite-support basis with a multiresolution structure, i.e., basis functions are divided into groups with different resolutions-some focus on \"local\" function values at very short timescales, while others capture more \"global\" structures at longer timescales. In the following, we explain the idea of wavelet MRA with the simplest wavelet family\u2014Haar wavelets. A formal treatment covering all orthogonal wavelets is in Appendix A. Suppose we want to approximate a signal $f(t)$ over the time interval $[0,1)$. The roughest approximation we can produce is $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(t) \\triangleq a_{0,0} \\phi(t)$ where $\\phi(t)=\\mathbf{1}(0 \\leq t<1)$ and $a_{0,0}=\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) d t$ is the average value of $f$. We use superscript 0 to indicate that this is the lowest resolution\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c73650bba3fd55f70b28g-02.jpg?height=830&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1081)\n\nFigure 1. In standard MRA, we approximate the continuous signal $f$ with $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$. Here, we visualize $\\hat{f}^{(3)}$ and its decomposition into a sum of functions that capture structures of increasing resolution over a binary-tree-partitioned input space, corresponding to Eq. (1). Components belonging to the same level have the same color. The non-transparent components of each resolution level retain the most recent information in the decomposition. Retaining only these components corresponds to our MULTIRESLAYER with a \"resolution fading\" TreESeLECT. approximation of $f$ we make. We can better approximate $f$ by dividing the unit interval in two and approximating $f$ as: $f(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(1)}(t) \\triangleq a_{1,0} \\phi(2 t)+a_{1,1} \\phi(2 t-1)$ where $a_{1,0}=\\int_{0}^{1 / 2} f(t) d t$ and $a_{1,1}=\\int_{1 / 2}^{1} f(t) d t$. We can repeat this procedure of halving the intervals, rescaling, and translating $\\phi$, to get finer approximations $\\left\\{\\hat{f}^{(j)}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. Each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is a linear combinations of compactly supported basis functions, $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}(t) \\triangleq 2^{j / 2} \\phi\\left(2^{j} t-k\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, with their resolution levels indexed by $j$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(j)}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{j, k} \\phi_{j, k}(t), \\text { where } a_{j, k}=\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, k}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor each level $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the subspace $V_{j} \\triangleq \\operatorname{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\right)$ contains functions that are constant over intervals of length $1 / 2^{j}$. In other words, basis functions in $V_{j}$ describe structures in $f$ no larger than the timescale of $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$. For sufficiently large $j, V_{j}$ has the capacity to approximate any continuous time series arbitrarily well. One may try to summarize or represent $f$ by collecting the coefficients $\\left\\{a_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ into a vector. Though the coefficients altogether fully describe the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$, each individual coefficient alone may be too local to be representative of structures in $f$. Each $a_{j, k}$ only summarizes the value of $f$\nwithin a $1 / 2^{j}$ interval, while patterns may occur over larger intervals. We would need multiple $a_{j, k}$ to summarize these larger-scale structures. Is there a way to produce coefficients each of which summarizes a structure at a different scale? Representing structure at disjoint resolutions. We can indeed produce this kind of representation by using tools from MRA. In MRA, we repeatedly decompose $V_{j}$ into the sum of a lower-resolution subspace $V_{j-1}$ and its orthogonal complement $W_{j-1}: V_{j}=V_{j-1} \\oplus W_{j-1}$. Since basis functions in $V_{j}$ and $V_{j-1}$ describe structures at scales coarser than $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$ and $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j-1}$, respectively, basis functions in $W_{j-1}$ represent structures exactly at the $1 / 2^{j}$ scale, summarized by the basis coefficients $\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. Starting from some high-resolution level $J$ and repeating this process, we have\n\n$$\nV_{J}=V_{J-1} \\oplus W_{J-1}=V_{0} \\oplus W_{0} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus W_{J-2} \\oplus W_{J-1}\n$$\n\nand, as visualized in Fig. 1,\n\n$$\nf(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(J)}(t)=a_{0,0} \\phi(t)+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{J-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} b_{j^{\\prime}, k} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}, k}(t)\n$$\n\nThe basis functions $\\left\\{\\psi_{j, k}\\right\\}$ are called Haar wavelets and $\\phi$ is called their scaling function; see Appendix A. 1 for their functional forms. The coefficients ${ }^{1}\\left\\{a_{0,0}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{b_{0, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\cup$ $\\ldots \\cup\\left\\{b_{J-1, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ now summarize the structures of $f$ at multiple resolutions, ranging from $1 / 2^{0}$ to $1 / 2^{J-1}$. Computing the representation. Our original problem of summarizing the multiresolution structures of $f$ then comes down to computing the wavelet basis coefficients $a_{0,0},\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}$ of the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(J)} \\in V_{J}$. See Appendix A. 1 for how to compute these coefficients for Haar wavelets. In general, we can efficiently and recursively compute these coefficients for any wavelet family using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT; see Appendix A.3). In Appendix D, we illustrate the representational power of wavelet transforms. In particular, we consider a raw audio waveform capturing 1 second of a recording at a sampling rate of 16,384 . We use a 10 -level wavelet tree with a total of 2068 coefficients used to reconstruct the audio signal. The wavelet transform is able to \"memorize\" many of the important patterns of the audio signal over this long sequence. This representational power motivates our MultiresLayer outlined in Sec.\n```\n\n#### 3. MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection (Avg. Score: 0.73)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/35 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03234, 2024.

These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 35/59 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\narXiv:2401.04722, 2024. [40] H.

Adaptive wavelet distillation from neural networks through interpretations\n\n*From Search Query: efficient wavelet transform neural networks*\n\n*Wooseok Ha, Chandan Singh, F. Lanusse, E. Song, Song Dang, Kangmin He, S. Upadhyayula, Bin Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adapt wavelet distillation (AWD) is proposed, a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform and yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency. Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the context of respective domains.

Wavelet Feature Maps Compression for Image-to-Image CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient wavelet transform neural networks*\n\n*Shahaf E. Finder, Yair Zohav, Maor Ashkenazi, Eran Treister*\n\n**TL;DR:** Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) is proposed -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for requiring extensive computational resources, and quantization is among the best and most common methods for compressing them. While aggressive quantization (i.e., less than 4-bits) performs well for classification, it may cause severe performance degradation in image-to-image tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures. To this end, we use an efficient and hardware-friendly Haar-wavelet transform, known for its effectiveness in image compression, and define the convolution on the compressed activation map. We experiment with various tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. By combining WCC with light quantization, we achieve compression rates equivalent to 1-4bit activation quantization with relatively small and much more graceful degradation in performance.

Learning filter widths of spectral decompositions with wavelets\n\n*From Search Query: efficient wavelet transform neural networks*\n\n*Haidar Khan, B. Yener*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that the wavelet deconvolution layer can improve neural network based time series classifiers both in accuracy and interpretability by learning directly from the input signal.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series classification using deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), operate on the spectral decomposition of the time series computed using a preprocessing step. This step can include a large number of hyperparameters, such as window length, filter widths, and filter shapes, each with a range of possible values that must be chosen using time and data intensive cross-validation procedures. We propose the wavelet deconvolution (WD) layer as an efficient alternative to this preprocessing step that eliminates a significant number of hyperparameters. The WD layer uses wavelet functions with adjustable scale parameters to learn the spectral decomposition directly from the signal. Using backpropagation, we show the scale parameters can be optimized with gradient descent. Furthermore, the WD layer adds interpretability to the learned time series classifier by exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform. In our experiments, we show that the WD layer can automatically extract the frequency content used to generate a dataset. The WD layer combined with a CNN applied to the phone recognition task on the TIMIT database achieves a phone error rate of 18.1\\%, a relative improvement of 4\\% over the baseline CNN. Experiments on a dataset where engineered features are not available showed WD+CNN is the best performing method. Our results show that the WD layer can improve neural network based time series classifiers both in accuracy and interpretability by learning directly from the input signal.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. A Multi-Resolution Framework for U-Nets with Applications to Hierarchical VAEs\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space models*\n\n*Fabian Falck, Christopher Williams, D. Danks, George Deligiannidis, C. Yau, Chris C. Holmes, A. Doucet, M. Willetts*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-resolution framework is formulated which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space and identifies state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs) as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi- resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** U-Net architectures are ubiquitous in state-of-the-art deep learning, however their regularisation properties and relationship to wavelets are understudied. In this paper, we formulate a multi-resolution framework which identifies U-Nets as finite-dimensional truncations of models on an infinite-dimensional function space. We provide theoretical results which prove that average pooling corresponds to projection within the space of square-integrable functions and show that U-Nets with average pooling implicitly learn a Haar wavelet basis representation of the data. We then leverage our framework to identify state-of-the-art hierarchical VAEs (HVAEs), which have a U-Net architecture, as a type of two-step forward Euler discretisation of multi-resolution diffusion processes which flow from a point mass, introducing sampling instabilities. We also demonstrate that HVAEs learn a representation of time which allows for improved parameter efficiency through weight-sharing. We use this observation to achieve state-of-the-art HVAE performance with half the number of parameters of existing models, exploiting the properties of our continuous-time formulation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Hierarchical Adaptive Value Estimation for Multi-modal Visual Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical processing*\n\n*Yangru Huang, Peixi Peng, Yifan Zhao, Haoran Xu, Mengyue Geng, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Local modality-customized Value Estimation (LVE) paradigm is proposed, which dynamically estimates the contribution and adjusts the importance weight of each modality from a value-level perspective, and a task-contextual re-fusion process is developed to achieve a task-level re-balance of estimations from both feature and value levels.\n\n**Abstract:** Integrating RGB frames with alternative modality inputs is gaining increasing traction in many vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) applications. Existing multi-modal vision-based RL methods usually follow a Global Value Estimation (GVE) pipeline, which uses a fused modality feature to obtain a uni\ufb01ed global environmental description. However, such a feature-level fusion paradigm with a single critic may fall short in policy learning as it tends to overlook the distinct values of each modality. To remedy this, this paper proposes a Local modality-customized Value Estimation (LVE) paradigm, which dynamically estimates the contribution and adjusts the importance weight of each modality from a value-level perspective. Furthermore, a task-contextual re-fusion process is developed to achieve a task-level re-balance of estimations from both feature and value levels. To this end, a Hierarchical Adaptive Value Estimation (HAVE) framework is formed, which adaptively coordinates the contributions of individual modalities as well as their collective ef\ufb01cacy. Agents trained by HAVE are able to exploit the unique characteristics of various modalities while capturing their intricate interactions, achieving substantially improved performance. We speci\ufb01cally highlight the potency of our approach within the challenging landscape of autonomous driving, utilizing the CARLA benchmark with neuromorphic event and depth data to demonstrate HAVE\u2019s capability and the effectiveness of its distinct components.

Out-of-Distribution Detection with An Adaptive Likelihood Ratio on Informative Hierarchical VAE\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical processing*\n\n*Yewen Li, Chaojie Wang, Xiaobo Xia, Tongliang Liu, Xin Miao, Bo An*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel score function for unsupervised OOD detection, referred to as Adaptive Likelihood Ratio, which can selectively aggregate the semantic information on multiple hidden layers of hierarchical VAEs, leading to a strong separability between in-distribution and OOD samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliability of machine learning. In the literature, existing work has shown that higher-level semantics captured by hierarchical VAEs can be used to detect OOD instances. However, we empirically show that, the inheirt \u201c posterior collapse \u201d of hierarchical VAEs would seriously limit their capacity for OOD detection. Based on a thorough analysis, we propose an informative hierarchical VAE to alleviate this issue through enhancing the connections between the data sample and its multi-layer stochastic latent representations during training. Furthermore, we propose a novel score function for unsupervised OOD detection, referred to as Adaptive Likelihood Ratio, which can selectively aggregate the semantic information on multiple hidden layers of hierarchical VAEs, leading to a strong separability between in-distribution and OOD samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art unsupervised OOD detection approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Adaptive Distribution Calibration for Few-Shot Learning with Hierarchical Optimal Transport\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical processing*\n\n*D. Guo, Longlong Tian, He Zhao, Mingyuan Zhou, H. Zha*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play model outperforms competing approaches and owns desired cross-domain generalization ability, indicating the effectiveness of the learned adaptive weights.\n\n**Abstract:** Few-shot classification aims to learn a classifier to recognize unseen classes during training, where the learned model can easily become over-fitted based on the biased distribution formed by only a few training examples. A recent solution to this problem is calibrating the distribution of these few sample classes by transferring statistics from the base classes with sufficient examples, where how to decide the transfer weights from base classes to novel classes is the key. However, principled approaches for learning the transfer weights have not been carefully studied. To this end, we propose a novel distribution calibration method by learning the adaptive weight matrix between novel samples and base classes, which is built upon a hierarchical Optimal Transport (H-OT) framework. By minimizing the high-level OT distance between novel samples and base classes, we can view the learned transport plan as the adaptive weight information for transferring the statistics of base classes. The learning of the cost function between a base class and novel class in the high-level OT leads to the introduction of the low-level OT, which considers the weights of all the data samples in the base class. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed plug-and-play model outperforms competing approaches and owns desired cross-domain generalization ability, indicating the effectiveness of the learned adaptive weights.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Wavelet Networks: Scale-Translation Equivariant Learning From Raw Time-Series\n\n*From Search Query: efficient wavelet transform neural networks*\n\n*David W. Romero, Mark Hoogendoorn, Erik J. Bekkers, Jakub M. Tomczak*\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging the symmetries inherent to specific data domains for the construction of equivariant neural networks has lead to remarkable improvements in terms of data efficiency and generalization. However, most existing research focuses on symmetries arising from planar and volumetric data, leaving a crucial data source largely underexplored: time-series. In this work, we fill this gap by leveraging the symmetries inherent to time-series for the construction of equivariant neural network. We identify two core symmetries: *scale and translation*, and construct scale-translation equivariant neural networks for time-series learning. Intriguingly, we find that scale-translation equivariant mappings share strong resemblance with the wavelet transform. Inspired by this resemblance, we term our networks Wavelet Networks, and show that they perform nested non-linear wavelet-like time-frequency transforms. Empirical results show that Wavelet Networks outperform conventional CNNs on raw waveforms, and match strongly engineered spectrogram techniques across several tasks and time-series types, including audio, environmental sounds, and electrical signals.

Wave-Mamba: Wavelet State Space Model for Ultra-High-Definition Low-Light Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space models*\n\n*Tongtong Liu, Weipeng Yang, Hongxia Gao, Wenbin Zou*\n\n**Abstract:** Ultra-high-definition (UHD) technology has attracted widespread attention due to its exceptional visual quality, but it also poses new challenges for low-light image enhancement (LLIE) techniques. UHD images inherently possess high computational complexity, leading existing UHD LLIE methods to employ high-magnification downsampling to reduce computational costs, which in turn results in information loss. The wavelet transform not only allows downsampling without loss of information, but also separates the image content from the noise. It enables state space models (SSMs) to avoid being affected by noise when modeling long sequences, thus making full use of the long-sequence modeling capability of SSMs. On this basis, we propose Wave-Mamba, a novel approach based on two pivotal insights derived from the wavelet domain: 1) most of the content information of an image exists in the low-frequency component, less in the high-frequency component. 2) The high-frequency component exerts a minimal influence on the outcomes of low-light enhancement. Specifically, to efficiently model global content information on UHD images, we proposed a low-frequency state space block (LFSSBlock) by improving SSMs to focus on restoring the information of low-frequency sub-bands. Moreover, we propose a high-frequency enhance block (HFEBlock) for high-frequency sub-band information, which uses the enhanced low-frequency information to correct the high-frequency information and effectively restore the correct high-frequency details. Through comprehensive evaluation, our method has demonstrated superior performance, significantly outshining current leading techniques while maintaining a more streamlined architecture.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space models*\n\n*Emily B. Fox, Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02\n\n\n\n#### 5. Beyond 512 Tokens: Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder for Long-Form Document Matching\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical processing*\n\n*Liu Yang, Michael Bendersky, Mingyang Zhang, Marc Najork, Cheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing and information retrieval problems can be formalized as the task of semantic matching. Existing work in this area has been largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question answering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval). Semantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important applications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and document clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research effort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These models, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one paragraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with respect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for long-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt self-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture sentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model with a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the masked word language modeling task used by BERT. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets for long-form document matching show that our proposed SMITH model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models including hierarchical attention, multi-depth attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network, and BERT. Comparing to BERT based baselines, our model is able to increase maximum input text length from 512 to 2048. We will open source a Wikipedia based benchmark dataset, code and a pre-trained checkpoint to accelerate future research on long-form document matching.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-26\n\n\n\n#### 6. MAXIM: Multi-Axis MLP for Image Processing\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical processing*\n\n*Yinxiao Li, Alan Bovik, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang, Han Zhang, Hossein Talebi, Zhengzhong Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent progress on Transformers and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models provide new network architectural designs for computer vision tasks. Although these models proved to be effective in many vision tasks such as image recognition, there remain challenges in adapting them for low-level vision. The inflexibility to support high-resolution images and limitations of local attention are perhaps the main bottlenecks. In this work, we present a multi-axis MLP based architecture called MAXIM, that can serve as an efficient and flexible general-purpose vision backbone for image processing tasks. MAXIM uses a UNet-shaped hierarchical structure and supports long-range interactions enabled by spatially-gated MLPs. Specifically, MAXIM contains two MLP-based building blocks: a multi-axis gated MLP that allows for efficient and scalable spatial mixing of local and global visual cues, and a cross-gating block, an alternative to cross-attention, which accounts for cross-feature conditioning. Both these modules are exclusively based on MLPs, but also benefit from being both global and `fully-convolutional', two properties that are desirable for image processing. Our extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAXIM model achieves state-of-the-art performance on more than ten benchmarks across a range of image processing tasks, including denoising, deblurring, deraining, dehazing, and enhancement while requiring fewer or comparable numbers of parameters and FLOPs than competitive models.

It highlights the design of a deep neural network with convolutional kernels and hard thresholds, which can be adapted for efficient wavelet transformations within neural architectures.\n- The study \"Exploring Wavelet Transformations for Deep Learning-based ... - arXiv\" tests various wavelet transformation methods using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This work provides insights into how different wavelet transformations can be efficiently implemented in deep learning models, which could be extended to autoregressive language models.\n\n## Integration Methods for Wavelets and State Space Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly address the integration of wavelets with state space models in the context of language models, the concept of hierarchical state space models can be combined with wavelet processing. For instance, the idea from \"Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\" can be adapted by incorporating wavelet transforms between layers of the state space model to enhance multi-scale feature extraction and hierarchical decomposition.\n- Theoretical foundations from \"Theoretical Foundations of Deep Selective State-Space Models\" can be leveraged to ensure stability and robustness when integrating wavelet transforms into state space models, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the autoregressive language model.\n\n## Adaptive Mechanisms for Processing Hierarchical Structures in Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing can be enhanced by using wavelet decomposition between layers, as suggested in \"Multi-level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks\". This approach can be adapted for autoregressive language models by stacking multiple layers with different temporal scales and using wavelet decomposition to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n- Adaptive mechanisms can be developed by leveraging the properties of wavelets for noise reduction and the theoretical guarantees from state space models. For example, using wavelet properties to reduce noise and leveraging selectivity mechanisms in state space models can help in designing adaptive hierarchical processing that balances complexity with efficiency.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Efficiency and Complexity**: The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) offers an efficient computational complexity of O(N), which is beneficial for real-time processing and can be particularly useful in autoregressive models where sequential data is processed.\n- **Stability and Robustness**: Ensuring stability across varying sequence lengths is crucial. Theoretical foundations from state space models, combined with the noise reduction capabilities of wavelets, can help in achieving robustness and stability in the model.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages the multi-scale analysis of wavelets, the hierarchical structure of state space models, and adaptive mechanisms to enhance efficiency, stability, and overall performance.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.55)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/37 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\n120-131.

Our MUlTIRESLAYER has key advantages over this body of past work:\n\n- Architecture simplicity: The workhorse of our layer is simple dilated convolutions and linear transforms. - Efficient training: Our layer parallelizes easily across hardware accelerators implementing convolutions. - Parameter efficiency: Our layer reuses filters across the stack of depthwise dilated convolutions. Likewise, by leveraging an MRA structure, we start from a principled and interpretable framework for thinking about memory in sequence modeling. Furthermore, we can lean on the vast MRA literature for modeling generalizations, such as shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) for shift-invariant representation learning, scaling to multiple input dimensions, etc. Our empirical evaluation covers sequential image classification and autoregressive generative modeling (CIFAR-10), reasoning on syntax trees (ListOps), and multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (PTB-XL). We also note that our proposed MULTIRESCONVs can readily be applied and extended to other tasks such as representation learning and long-term forecasting. Likewise, although we focus on sequence analysis, the ideas we propose generalize to other data domains with multiresolution structure, such as images and videos. Exploring the application of MULTIRESLAYER in these settings is an exciting future direction. ## 2. Background: Wavelet Decompositions\n\nIn contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of Fourier transforms, wavelets provide a time-frequency analysis. In particular, wavelets are a finite-support basis with a multiresolution structure, i.e., basis functions are divided into groups with different resolutions-some focus on \"local\" function values at very short timescales, while others capture more \"global\" structures at longer timescales. In the following, we explain the idea of wavelet MRA with the simplest wavelet family\u2014Haar wavelets. A formal treatment covering all orthogonal wavelets is in Appendix A. Suppose we want to approximate a signal $f(t)$ over the time interval $[0,1)$. The roughest approximation we can produce is $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(t) \\triangleq a_{0,0} \\phi(t)$ where $\\phi(t)=\\mathbf{1}(0 \\leq t<1)$ and $a_{0,0}=\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) d t$ is the average value of $f$. We use superscript 0 to indicate that this is the lowest resolution\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c73650bba3fd55f70b28g-02.jpg?height=830&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1081)\n\nFigure 1. In standard MRA, we approximate the continuous signal $f$ with $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$. Here, we visualize $\\hat{f}^{(3)}$ and its decomposition into a sum of functions that capture structures of increasing resolution over a binary-tree-partitioned input space, corresponding to Eq. (1). Components belonging to the same level have the same color. The non-transparent components of each resolution level retain the most recent information in the decomposition. Retaining only these components corresponds to our MULTIRESLAYER with a \"resolution fading\" TreESeLECT. approximation of $f$ we make. We can better approximate $f$ by dividing the unit interval in two and approximating $f$ as: $f(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(1)}(t) \\triangleq a_{1,0} \\phi(2 t)+a_{1,1} \\phi(2 t-1)$ where $a_{1,0}=\\int_{0}^{1 / 2} f(t) d t$ and $a_{1,1}=\\int_{1 / 2}^{1} f(t) d t$. We can repeat this procedure of halving the intervals, rescaling, and translating $\\phi$, to get finer approximations $\\left\\{\\hat{f}^{(j)}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. Each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is a linear combinations of compactly supported basis functions, $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}(t) \\triangleq 2^{j / 2} \\phi\\left(2^{j} t-k\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, with their resolution levels indexed by $j$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(j)}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{j, k} \\phi_{j, k}(t), \\text { where } a_{j, k}=\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, k}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor each level $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the subspace $V_{j} \\triangleq \\operatorname{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\right)$ contains functions that are constant over intervals of length $1 / 2^{j}$. In other words, basis functions in $V_{j}$ describe structures in $f$ no larger than the timescale of $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$. For sufficiently large $j, V_{j}$ has the capacity to approximate any continuous time series arbitrarily well. One may try to summarize or represent $f$ by collecting the coefficients $\\left\\{a_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ into a vector. Though the coefficients altogether fully describe the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$, each individual coefficient alone may be too local to be representative of structures in $f$. Each $a_{j, k}$ only summarizes the value of $f$\nwithin a $1 / 2^{j}$ interval, while patterns may occur over larger intervals. We would need multiple $a_{j, k}$ to summarize these larger-scale structures. Is there a way to produce coefficients each of which summarizes a structure at a different scale? Representing structure at disjoint resolutions. We can indeed produce this kind of representation by using tools from MRA. In MRA, we repeatedly decompose $V_{j}$ into the sum of a lower-resolution subspace $V_{j-1}$ and its orthogonal complement $W_{j-1}: V_{j}=V_{j-1} \\oplus W_{j-1}$. Since basis functions in $V_{j}$ and $V_{j-1}$ describe structures at scales coarser than $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$ and $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j-1}$, respectively, basis functions in $W_{j-1}$ represent structures exactly at the $1 / 2^{j}$ scale, summarized by the basis coefficients $\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. Starting from some high-resolution level $J$ and repeating this process, we have\n\n$$\nV_{J}=V_{J-1} \\oplus W_{J-1}=V_{0} \\oplus W_{0} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus W_{J-2} \\oplus W_{J-1}\n$$\n\nand, as visualized in Fig. 1,\n\n$$\nf(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(J)}(t)=a_{0,0} \\phi(t)+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{J-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} b_{j^{\\prime}, k} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}, k}(t)\n$$\n\nThe basis functions $\\left\\{\\psi_{j, k}\\right\\}$ are called Haar wavelets and $\\phi$ is called their scaling function; see Appendix A. 1 for their functional forms. The coefficients ${ }^{1}\\left\\{a_{0,0}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{b_{0, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\cup$ $\\ldots \\cup\\left\\{b_{J-1, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ now summarize the structures of $f$ at multiple resolutions, ranging from $1 / 2^{0}$ to $1 / 2^{J-1}$. Computing the representation. Our original problem of summarizing the multiresolution structures of $f$ then comes down to computing the wavelet basis coefficients $a_{0,0},\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}$ of the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(J)} \\in V_{J}$. See Appendix A. 1 for how to compute these coefficients for Haar wavelets. In general, we can efficiently and recursively compute these coefficients for any wavelet family using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT; see Appendix A.3). In Appendix D, we illustrate the representational power of wavelet transforms. In particular, we consider a raw audio waveform capturing 1 second of a recording at a sampling rate of 16,384 . We use a 10 -level wavelet tree with a total of 2068 coefficients used to reconstruct the audio signal. The wavelet transform is able to \"memorize\" many of the important patterns of the audio signal over this long sequence. This representational power motivates our MultiresLayer outlined in Sec.\n```\n\n#### 3. MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/35 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03234, 2024.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient wavelet transform*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. RED : Looking for Redundancies for Data-Free Structured Compression of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Edouard Yvinec, Arnaud Dapogny, M. Cord, K\u00e9vin Bailly*\n\n**TL;DR:** Red is presented, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning ofDeep Neural Networks by proposing a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are ubiquitous in today's computer vision land-scape, despite involving considerable computational costs. The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Our contributions are three-fold: (i) we show how entropies and mutual informations can be derived from heuristic statistical physics methods, under the assumption that weight matrices are independent and orthogonally-invariant. (ii) We extend particular cases in which this result is known to be rigorously exact by providing a proof for two-layers networks with Gaussian random weights, using the recently introduced adaptive interpolation method. (iii) We propose an experiment framework with generative models of synthetic datasets, on which we train deep neural networks with a weight constraint designed so that the assumption in (i) is verified during learning. We study the behavior of entropies and mutual informations throughout learning and conclude that, in the proposed setting, the relationship between compression and generalization remains elusive.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 167  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Selective Frequency Network for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: SSM wavelet integration*\n\n*Yuning Cui, Y. Tao, Zhenshan Bing, Wenqi Ren, Xinwei Gao, Xiaochun Cao, Kai Huang, Alois Knoll*\n\n**TL;DR:** A multi-branch and content-aware module is exploited to decompose features into separate frequency subbands dynamically and locally, and then accentuate the useful ones via channel-wise attention weights to handle large-scale degradation blurs.\n\n**Abstract:** Image restoration aims to reconstruct the latent sharp image from its corrupted counterpart. Besides dealing with this long-standing task in the spatial domain, a few approaches seek solutions in the frequency domain in consideration of the large discrepancy between spectra of sharp/degraded image pairs. However, these works commonly utilize transformation tools, e.g., wavelet transform, to split features into several frequency parts, which is not flexible enough to select the most informative frequency component to recover. In this paper, we exploit a multi-branch and content-aware module to decompose features into separate frequency subbands dynamically and locally, and then accentuate the useful ones via channel-wise attention weights. In addition, to handle large-scale degradation blurs, we propose an extremely simple decoupling and modulation module to enlarge the receptive field via global and window-based average pooling. Integrating two developed modules into a U-Net backbone, the proposed Selective Frequency Network (SFNet) performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms on five image restoration tasks, including single-image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, image motion deblurring, image desnowing, and image deraining 1.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 7. Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: SSM wavelet integration*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Pierre-Luc Bacon, C.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: SSM wavelet integration*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Differentiable and accelerated wavelet transforms on the sphere and ball\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient wavelet transform*\n\n*Jason D. McEwen, Jessica Whitney, Alicja Polanska, Matthew A. Price*\n\n**Abstract:** Directional wavelet dictionaries are hierarchical representations which efficiently capture and segment information across scale, location and orientation. Such representations demonstrate a particular affinity to physical signals, which often exhibit highly anisotropic, localised multiscale structure. Many physically important signals are observed over spherical domains, such as the celestial sky in cosmology. Leveraging recent advances in computational harmonic analysis, we design new highly distributable and automatically differentiable directional wavelet transforms on the $2$-dimensional sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$ and $3$-dimensional ball $\\mathbb{B}^3 = \\mathbb{R}^+ \\times \\mathbb{S}^2$ (the space formed by augmenting the sphere with the radial half-line). We observe up to a $300$-fold and $21800$-fold acceleration for signals on the sphere and ball, respectively, compared to existing software, whilst maintaining 64-bit machine precision. Not only do these algorithms dramatically accelerate existing spherical wavelet transforms, the gradient information afforded by automatic differentiation unlocks many data-driven analysis techniques previously not possible for these spaces. We publicly release both S2WAV and S2BALL, open-sourced JAX libraries for our transforms that are automatically differentiable and readily deployable both on and over clusters of hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs & TPUs).\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. Wavelet Feature Maps Compression for Image-to-Image CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient wavelet transform*\n\n*Eran Treister, Maor Ashkenazi, Yair Zohav, Shahaf E. Finder*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for requiring extensive computational resources, and quantization is among the best and most common methods for compressing them. While aggressive quantization (i.e., less than 4-bits) performs well for classification, it may cause severe performance degradation in image-to-image tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures. To this end, we use an efficient and hardware-friendly Haar-wavelet transform, known for its effectiveness in image compression, and define the convolution on the compressed activation map. We experiment with various tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. By combining WCC with light quantization, we achieve compression rates equivalent to 1-4bit activation quantization with relatively small and much more graceful degradation in performance.

Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the specified keywords and details, here are some relevant points and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Wavelet Transforms in Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of using wavelet transforms in neural networks can be highly efficient, especially when implemented with hardware-friendly techniques. For instance, the Haar wavelet transform is noted for its simplicity and hardware efficiency. A study on \"Wavelet Feature Maps Compression\" highlights the use of Haar-wavelet transforms for compressing activation maps, which can be integrated into convolutional layers, making it a viable approach for autoregressive models as well[5,.\n\n- Another approach is the use of adaptive wavelet distillation, which not only provides interpretability but also computational efficiency. This method penalizes feature attributions in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform, which can be beneficial for reducing computational costs in autoregressive models.\n\n### Adaptive Compression Techniques for Activation Maps and States\n\n- Adaptive compression techniques are crucial for reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements of neural networks. The \"Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC)\" approach is a novel method that integrates point-wise convolutions with efficient Haar-wavelet transforms to compress high-resolution activation maps. This technique can be adapted for autoregressive models to compress activation maps and states efficiently.\n\n- Additionally, the \"Adaptive wavelet distillation\" method can be extended to compress states in autoregressive models by applying wavelet transforms to the feature attributions, thereby reducing the dimensionality and computational overhead.\n\n### Methods for Integrating Wavelets with State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- Integrating wavelets with state space models can enhance the multi-resolution analysis capabilities of the model. While the provided sources do not directly discuss integrating wavelets with SSMs, the concept of multi-resolution frameworks can be applied here. For example, a multi-resolution framework for U-Nets, which involves hierarchical processing, can be adapted for SSMs by incorporating wavelet transforms to analyze and process the state transitions at different resolutions.\n\n- The idea of using wavelet transforms to decompose signals into different frequency components can be applied to the state transitions in SSMs. This would allow the model to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies more effectively, similar to how wavelet transforms are used in signal processing to analyze non-stationary signals.\n\n### Summary and Future Directions\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Using Haar-wavelet transforms and adaptive wavelet distillation can provide hardware-efficient implementations for autoregressive language models.\n- **Adaptive Compression**: Techniques like Wavelet Compressed Convolution and adaptive wavelet distillation can be used to compress activation maps and states, reducing computational and memory requirements.\n- **Integration with SSMs**: Applying multi-resolution frameworks and wavelet transforms to state space models can enhance their ability to capture complex dependencies and transitions.\n\nBy exploring these avenues, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of wavelet transforms and adaptive compression techniques.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient state compression SSM, frequency state space integration, hardware optimization wavelets\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions.

We unveil self-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes smoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished representation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is sensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Scalable Bayesian inference of dendritic voltage via spatiotemporal recurrent state space models\n\n*From Search Query: frequency state space integration*\n\n*Ruoxi Sun, Scott W. Linderman, Ian Kinsella, L. Paninski*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generative nonlinear model that requires few parameters per compartment of the cell but is nonetheless flexible enough to sample realistic spatiotemporal data and outperforms previously developed linear methods, and scales to much larger systems than previous methods based on sequential Monte Carlo approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in optical voltage sensors have brought us closer to a critical goal in cellular neuroscience: imaging the full spatiotemporal voltage on a dendritic tree. However, current sensors and imaging approaches still face significant limitations in SNR and sampling frequency; therefore statistical denoising and interpolation methods remain critical for understanding single-trial spatiotemporal dendritic voltage dynamics. Previous denoising approaches were either based on an inadequate linear voltage model or scaled poorly to large trees. Here we introduce a scalable fully Bayesian approach. We develop a generative nonlinear model that requires few parameters per compartment of the cell but is nonetheless flexible enough to sample realistic spatiotemporal data. The model captures different dynamics in each compartment and leverages biophysical knowledge to constrain intra- and inter-compartmental dynamics. We obtain a full posterior distribution over spatiotemporal voltage via an augmented Gibbs sampling algorithm. The nonlinear smoother model outperforms previously developed linear methods, and scales to much larger systems than previous methods based on sequential Monte Carlo approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization wavelets*\n\n*Aviral Kumar, A. Yazdanbakhsh, Milad Hashemi, Kevin Swersky, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a\"simulation-driven\"approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a\"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization wavelets*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 9. Bounce: Reliable High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization for Combinatorial and Mixed Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization wavelets*\n\n*Leonard Papenmeier, Luigi Nardi, Matthias Poloczek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality that reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Impactful applications such as materials discovery, hardware design, neural architecture search, or portfolio optimization require optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions with mixed and combinatorial input spaces. While Bayesian optimization has recently made significant progress in solving such problems, an in-depth analysis reveals that the current state-of-the-art methods are not reliable. Their performances degrade substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. To fill the need for a reliable algorithm for combinatorial and mixed spaces, this paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality. Comprehensive experiments show that Bounce reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression SSM*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. MambaVC: Learned Visual Compression with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression SSM*\n\n*YaoWei Wang, Shutao Xia, Tao Dai, Baoyi An, Tianci Luo, Bin Chen, Yimin Zhou, Jinpeng Wang, Shiyu Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages.

Frequency Decomposition-Driven Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Remote Sensing Image Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: frequency state space integration*\n\n*Siwei Ma, Man-on Pun, Xingchen Ding, Xiaokang Zhang, Xianping Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-domain semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) imagery based on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques has significantly advanced deep-learning applications in the geosciences. Recently, with its ingenious and versatile architecture, the Transformer model has been successfully applied in RS-UDA tasks. However, existing UDA methods mainly focus on domain alignment in the high-level feature space. It is still challenging to retain cross-domain local spatial details and global contextual semantics simultaneously, which is crucial for the RS image semantic segmentation task. To address these problems, we propose novel high/low-frequency decomposition (HLFD) techniques to guide representation alignment in cross-domain semantic segmentation. Specifically, HLFD attempts to decompose the feature maps into high- and low-frequency components before performing the domain alignment in the corresponding subspaces. Secondly, to further facilitate the alignment of decomposed features, we propose a fully global-local generative adversarial network, namely GLGAN, to learn domain-invariant detailed and semantic features across domains by leveraging global-local transformer blocks (GLTBs). By integrating HLFD techniques and the GLGAN, a novel UDA framework called FD-GLGAN is developed to improve the cross-domain transferability and generalization capability of semantic segmentation models. Extensive experiments on two fine-resolution benchmark datasets, namely ISPRS Potsdam and ISPRS Vaihingen, highlight the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art UDA methods.

Time-space-frequency feature Fusion for 3-channel motor imagery classification\n\n*From Search Query: frequency state space integration*\n\n*Meirong Zhao, Zhengqing Miao*\n\n**Abstract:** Low-channel EEG devices are crucial for portable and entertainment applications. However, the low spatial resolution of EEG presents challenges in decoding low-channel motor imagery. This study introduces TSFF-Net, a novel network architecture that integrates time-space-frequency features, effectively compensating for the limitations of single-mode feature extraction networks based on time-series or time-frequency modalities. TSFF-Net comprises four main components: time-frequency representation, time-frequency feature extraction, time-space feature extraction, and feature fusion and classification. Time-frequency representation and feature extraction transform raw EEG signals into time-frequency spectrograms and extract relevant features. The time-space network processes time-series EEG trials as input and extracts temporal-spatial features. Feature fusion employs MMD loss to constrain the distribution of time-frequency and time-space features in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, subsequently combining these features using a weighted fusion approach to obtain effective time-space-frequency features. Moreover, few studies have explored the decoding of three-channel motor imagery based on time-frequency spectrograms. This study proposes a shallow, lightweight decoding architecture (TSFF-img) based on time-frequency spectrograms and compares its classification performance in low-channel motor imagery with other methods using two publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFF-Net not only compensates for the shortcomings of single-mode feature extraction networks in EEG decoding, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Overall, TSFF-Net offers considerable advantages in decoding low-channel motor imagery and provides valuable insights for algorithmically enhancing low-channel EEG decoding.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-04\n\n\n\n#### 5. LLCaps: Learning to Illuminate Low-Light Capsule Endoscopy with Curved Wavelet Attention and Reverse Diffusion\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization wavelets*\n\n*Hongliang Ren, Mobarakol Islam, An Wang, Yanan Wu, Tong Chen, Long Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is a painless and non-invasive diagnostic tool for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. However, due to GI anatomical constraints and hardware manufacturing limitations, WCE vision signals may suffer from insufficient illumination, leading to a complicated screening and examination procedure. Deep learning-based low-light image enhancement (LLIE) in the medical field gradually attracts researchers. Given the exuberant development of the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) in computer vision, we introduce a WCE LLIE framework based on the multi-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) and reverse diffusion process. The multi-scale design allows models to preserve high-resolution representation and context information from low-resolution, while the curved wavelet attention (CWA) block is proposed for high-frequency and local feature learning. Furthermore, we combine the reverse diffusion procedure to further optimize the shallow output and generate the most realistic image. The proposed method is compared with ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLIE methods and significantly outperforms quantitatively and qualitatively. The superior performance on GI disease segmentation further demonstrates the clinical potential of our proposed model. Our code is publicly accessible.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. Blockchain Transaction Fee Forecasting: A Comparison of Machine Learning Methods\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization wavelets*\n\n*Martin Crane, Conall Butler*\n\n**Abstract:** Gas is the transaction-fee metering system of the Ethereum network. Users of the network are required to select a gas price for submission with their transaction, creating a risk of overpaying or delayed/unprocessed transactions in this selection. In this work, we investigate data in the aftermath of the London Hard Fork and shed insight into the transaction dynamics of the net-work after this major fork. As such, this paper provides an update on work previous to 2019 on the link between EthUSD BitUSD and gas price. For forecasting, we compare a novel combination of machine learning methods such as Direct Recursive Hybrid LSTM, CNNLSTM, and Attention LSTM. These are combined with wavelet threshold denoising and matrix profile data processing toward the forecasting of block minimum gas price, on a 5-min timescale, over multiple lookaheads. As the first application of the matrix profile being applied to gas price data and forecasting we are aware of, this study demonstrates that matrix profile data can enhance attention-based models however, given the hardware constraints, hybrid models outperformed attention and CNNLSTM models. The wavelet coherence of inputs demonstrates correlation in multiple variables on a 1 day timescale, which is a deviation of base free from gas price. A Direct-Recursive Hybrid LSTM strategy outperforms other models. Hybrid models have favourable performance up to a 20 min lookahead with performance being comparable to attention models when forecasting 25/50-min ahead. Forecasts over a range of lookaheads allow users to make an informed decision on gas price selection and the optimal window to submit their transaction in without fear of their transaction being rejected. This, in turn, gives more detailed insight into gas price dynamics than existing recommenders, oracles and forecasting approaches, which provide simple heuristics or limited lookahead horizons.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on efficient state compression in State Space Models (SSMs), combining frequency-domain and state-space representations, and hardware optimization for wavelet-based operations, here are some relevant findings and suggestions:\n\n## Efficient Compression Techniques for State Representations in SSMs\n\n- The paper on \"A Sparse, Precise, and Efficient Spiking State Space Model for Long Sequences Learning\" (SPikE-SSM) discusses efficient compression strategies for state representations in SSMs. It proposes a boundary compression strategy (PMBC) to accelerate the inference of the spiking neuron model, enabling parallel processing for long sequence learning. Additionally, it integrates trainable thresholds and refractory magnitudes to balance accuracy and sparsity.\n- Another approach is seen in the work on \"MOPA\" and \"Poly-Mamba,\" which involves using multivariate orthogonal polynomial approximations to capture complex channel dependency patterns efficiently. This method improves the ability of SSMs to depict time-series data without significantly increasing computational complexity.\n\n## Methods for Combining Frequency-Domain and State-Space Representations\n\n- The concept of integrating frequency-domain operations with SSMs is hinted at in the analysis note, suggesting the use of wavelet-based decomposition for multi-scale feature extraction. This approach can be further explored by combining SSMs with wavelet transforms, similar to how \"Wavelet Feature Maps Compression\" uses Haar-wavelet transforms for image compression. This integration can be applied to sequence data to leverage both the temporal modeling of SSMs and the multi-scale analysis of wavelets[Analysis Note].\n- The \"Poly-Mamba\" method extends the orthogonal polynomial function basis space to a multivariate orthogonal polynomial basis, which could be adapted to incorporate frequency-domain representations by using wavelet transforms to decompose the input data before feeding it into the SSM.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies for Wavelet-Based Neural Network Operations\n\n- The \"FlashFFTConv\" paper provides insights into hardware-efficient matrix operations using FFT, which can be adapted for wavelet transforms. It demonstrates how matrix decomposition and kernel fusion can speed up operations, a technique that could be applied to wavelet-based neural networks[Analysis Note].\n- The use of Haar-wavelet transforms, known for their hardware-friendly implementation, is discussed in \"Wavelet Feature Maps Compression.\" This approach can be extended to neural network operations by defining convolutions on compressed activation maps, which is particularly efficient in hardware[Analysis Note].\n- The \"QServe: W4A8KV4 Quantization and System Co-design for Efficient LLM Serving\" paper, while focused on quantization, also touches on system co-design and optimization. It suggests methods like progressive quantization and smooth attention, which could be adapted to optimize wavelet-based operations in terms of memory and computational efficiency.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages efficient state compression, integrates frequency-domain and state-space representations, and optimizes hardware performance for wavelet-based operations.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.47)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.40)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/46 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP), pages 4779-4783.

Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/37 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\n120-131.

Our MUlTIRESLAYER has key advantages over this body of past work:\n\n- Architecture simplicity: The workhorse of our layer is simple dilated convolutions and linear transforms. - Efficient training: Our layer parallelizes easily across hardware accelerators implementing convolutions. - Parameter efficiency: Our layer reuses filters across the stack of depthwise dilated convolutions. Likewise, by leveraging an MRA structure, we start from a principled and interpretable framework for thinking about memory in sequence modeling. Furthermore, we can lean on the vast MRA literature for modeling generalizations, such as shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) for shift-invariant representation learning, scaling to multiple input dimensions, etc. Our empirical evaluation covers sequential image classification and autoregressive generative modeling (CIFAR-10), reasoning on syntax trees (ListOps), and multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (PTB-XL). We also note that our proposed MULTIRESCONVs can readily be applied and extended to other tasks such as representation learning and long-term forecasting. Likewise, although we focus on sequence analysis, the ideas we propose generalize to other data domains with multiresolution structure, such as images and videos. Exploring the application of MULTIRESLAYER in these settings is an exciting future direction. ## 2. Background: Wavelet Decompositions\n\nIn contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of Fourier transforms, wavelets provide a time-frequency analysis. In particular, wavelets are a finite-support basis with a multiresolution structure, i.e., basis functions are divided into groups with different resolutions-some focus on \"local\" function values at very short timescales, while others capture more \"global\" structures at longer timescales. In the following, we explain the idea of wavelet MRA with the simplest wavelet family\u2014Haar wavelets. A formal treatment covering all orthogonal wavelets is in Appendix A. Suppose we want to approximate a signal $f(t)$ over the time interval $[0,1)$. The roughest approximation we can produce is $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(t) \\triangleq a_{0,0} \\phi(t)$ where $\\phi(t)=\\mathbf{1}(0 \\leq t<1)$ and $a_{0,0}=\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) d t$ is the average value of $f$. We use superscript 0 to indicate that this is the lowest resolution\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c73650bba3fd55f70b28g-02.jpg?height=830&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1081)\n\nFigure 1. In standard MRA, we approximate the continuous signal $f$ with $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$. Here, we visualize $\\hat{f}^{(3)}$ and its decomposition into a sum of functions that capture structures of increasing resolution over a binary-tree-partitioned input space, corresponding to Eq. (1). Components belonging to the same level have the same color. The non-transparent components of each resolution level retain the most recent information in the decomposition. Retaining only these components corresponds to our MULTIRESLAYER with a \"resolution fading\" TreESeLECT. approximation of $f$ we make. We can better approximate $f$ by dividing the unit interval in two and approximating $f$ as: $f(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(1)}(t) \\triangleq a_{1,0} \\phi(2 t)+a_{1,1} \\phi(2 t-1)$ where $a_{1,0}=\\int_{0}^{1 / 2} f(t) d t$ and $a_{1,1}=\\int_{1 / 2}^{1} f(t) d t$. We can repeat this procedure of halving the intervals, rescaling, and translating $\\phi$, to get finer approximations $\\left\\{\\hat{f}^{(j)}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. Each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is a linear combinations of compactly supported basis functions, $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}(t) \\triangleq 2^{j / 2} \\phi\\left(2^{j} t-k\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, with their resolution levels indexed by $j$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(j)}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{j, k} \\phi_{j, k}(t), \\text { where } a_{j, k}=\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, k}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor each level $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the subspace $V_{j} \\triangleq \\operatorname{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\right)$ contains functions that are constant over intervals of length $1 / 2^{j}$. In other words, basis functions in $V_{j}$ describe structures in $f$ no larger than the timescale of $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$. For sufficiently large $j, V_{j}$ has the capacity to approximate any continuous time series arbitrarily well. One may try to summarize or represent $f$ by collecting the coefficients $\\left\\{a_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ into a vector. Though the coefficients altogether fully describe the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$, each individual coefficient alone may be too local to be representative of structures in $f$. Each $a_{j, k}$ only summarizes the value of $f$\nwithin a $1 / 2^{j}$ interval, while patterns may occur over larger intervals. We would need multiple $a_{j, k}$ to summarize these larger-scale structures. Is there a way to produce coefficients each of which summarizes a structure at a different scale? Representing structure at disjoint resolutions. We can indeed produce this kind of representation by using tools from MRA. In MRA, we repeatedly decompose $V_{j}$ into the sum of a lower-resolution subspace $V_{j-1}$ and its orthogonal complement $W_{j-1}: V_{j}=V_{j-1} \\oplus W_{j-1}$. Since basis functions in $V_{j}$ and $V_{j-1}$ describe structures at scales coarser than $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$ and $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j-1}$, respectively, basis functions in $W_{j-1}$ represent structures exactly at the $1 / 2^{j}$ scale, summarized by the basis coefficients $\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. Starting from some high-resolution level $J$ and repeating this process, we have\n\n$$\nV_{J}=V_{J-1} \\oplus W_{J-1}=V_{0} \\oplus W_{0} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus W_{J-2} \\oplus W_{J-1}\n$$\n\nand, as visualized in Fig. 1,\n\n$$\nf(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(J)}(t)=a_{0,0} \\phi(t)+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{J-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} b_{j^{\\prime}, k} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}, k}(t)\n$$\n\nThe basis functions $\\left\\{\\psi_{j, k}\\right\\}$ are called Haar wavelets and $\\phi$ is called their scaling function; see Appendix A. 1 for their functional forms. The coefficients ${ }^{1}\\left\\{a_{0,0}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{b_{0, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\cup$ $\\ldots \\cup\\left\\{b_{J-1, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ now summarize the structures of $f$ at multiple resolutions, ranging from $1 / 2^{0}$ to $1 / 2^{J-1}$. Computing the representation. Our original problem of summarizing the multiresolution structures of $f$ then comes down to computing the wavelet basis coefficients $a_{0,0},\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}$ of the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(J)} \\in V_{J}$. See Appendix A. 1 for how to compute these coefficients for Haar wavelets. In general, we can efficiently and recursively compute these coefficients for any wavelet family using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT; see Appendix A.3). In Appendix D, we illustrate the representational power of wavelet transforms. In particular, we consider a raw audio waveform capturing 1 second of a recording at a sampling rate of 16,384 . We use a 10 -level wavelet tree with a total of 2068 coefficients used to reconstruct the audio signal. The wavelet transform is able to \"memorize\" many of the important patterns of the audio signal over this long sequence. This representational power motivates our MultiresLayer outlined in Sec.\n```\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.22)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/49 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 34:22795-22807, 2021.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet hardware implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet hardware implementation*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Wavelet Feature Maps Compression for Image-to-Image CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet hardware implementation*\n\n*Shahaf E.

While aggressive quantization (i.e., less than 4-bits) performs well for classification, it may cause severe performance degradation in image-to-image tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures. To this end, we use an efficient and hardware-friendly Haar-wavelet transform, known for its effectiveness in image compression, and define the convolution on the compressed activation map. We experiment with various tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. By combining WCC with light quantization, we achieve compression rates equivalent to 1-4bit activation quantization with relatively small and much more graceful degradation in performance.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state space models*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state space models*\n\n*Yinhuai Wang, Jiwen Yu, Jian Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM), a novel zero-shot framework for arbitrary linear IR problems, including but not limited to image super-resolution, colorization, inpainting, compressed sensing, and deblurring, and proposes an enhanced and robust version, dubbed DDNM+, to support noisy restoration and improve restoration quality for hard tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Most existing Image Restoration (IR) models are task-specific, which can not be generalized to different degradation operators. In this work, we propose the Denoising Diffusion Null-Space Model (DDNM), a novel zero-shot framework for arbitrary linear IR problems, including but not limited to image super-resolution, colorization, inpainting, compressed sensing, and deblurring. DDNM only needs a pre-trained off-the-shelf diffusion model as the generative prior, without any extra training or network modifications. By refining only the null-space contents during the reverse diffusion process, we can yield diverse results satisfying both data consistency and realness. We further propose an enhanced and robust version, dubbed DDNM+, to support noisy restoration and improve restoration quality for hard tasks. Our experiments on several IR tasks reveal that DDNM outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot IR methods. We also demonstrate that DDNM+ can solve complex real-world applications, e.g., old photo restoration.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 305  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 6.

To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1497  (*Influential: 137*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Deep Multi-State Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks Operating on Wavelet Based Neural Features for Robust Brain Machine Interfaces\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet hardware implementation*\n\n*Luke Bashford, Benyamin Allahgholizadeh Haghi, Spencer Kellis, Charles Liu, Brian Lee, Sahil Shah, Maitreyi Ashok, Daniel Kramer, Azita Emami, Richard Andersen*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a new deep multi-state Dynamic Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN) architecture for Brain Machine Interface (BMI) applications. Our DRNN is used to predict Cartesian representation of a computer cursor movement kinematics from open-loop neural data recorded from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of a human subject in a BMI system. We design the algorithm to achieve a reasonable trade-off between performance and robustness, and we constrain memory usage in favor of future hardware implementation. We feed the predictions of the network back to the input to improve prediction performance and robustness. We apply a scheduled sampling approach to the model in order to solve a statistical distribution mismatch between the ground truth and predictions. Additionally, we configure a small DRNN to operate with a short history of input, reducing the required buffering of input data and number of memory accesses. This configuration lowers the expected power consumption in a neural network accelerator. Operating on wavelet-based neural features, we show that the average performance of DRNN surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in the literature on both single- and multi-day data recorded over 43 days. Results show that multi-state DRNN has the potential to model the nonlinear relationships between the neural data and kinematics for robust BMIs.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Toward A Formalized Approach for Spike Sorting Algorithms and Hardware Evaluation\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet hardware implementation*\n\n*Roman Genov, Majid Ahmadi, Amirali Amirsoleimani, Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi, Corey Lammie, Tim Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Spike sorting algorithms are used to separate extracellular recordings of neuronal populations into single-unit spike activities. The development of customized hardware implementing spike sorting algorithms is burgeoning. However, there is a lack of a systematic approach and a set of standardized evaluation criteria to facilitate direct comparison of both software and hardware implementations. In this paper, we formalize a set of standardized criteria and a publicly available synthetic dataset entitled Synthetic Simulations Of Extracellular Recordings (SSOER), which was constructed by aggregating existing synthetic datasets with varying Signal-To-Noise Ratios (SNRs). Furthermore, we present a benchmark for future comparison, and use our criteria to evaluate a simulated Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) In-Memory Computing (IMC) system using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for feature extraction. Our system consumes approximately (per channel) 10.72mW and occupies an area of 0.66mm$^2$ in a 22nm FDSOI Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) process.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-13\n\n\n\n#### 3.

AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state space models*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

This approach can be adapted for hardware implementation to enhance efficiency. For instance, Wav-KAN employs wavelet functions to construct Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), achieving higher accuracy and faster training compared to other variants.\n\n## Compression Techniques for State Space Models\n\n- Compression in state space models can be achieved through careful algorithm design and the use of multi-resolution processing. For example, the MultiresConv approach by Shi et al. uses shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, which reduces the parameter count while maintaining expressiveness. This method can be optimized for hardware implementation to process longer sequences efficiently.\n\n## Information Preservation in Compressed Neural Representations\n\n- To preserve information in compressed neural representations, techniques such as wavelet transforms can be used to capture multi-scale trends in the input sequence. The wavelet coefficients can be analyzed to identify dominant components, ensuring that significant information is retained even after compression. This is evident in the use of wavelet transforms for signal processing, where the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) helps in extracting key features from signals.\n\n## Real-World Applications of Wavelet-Based Sequence Models\n\n- Wavelet-based sequence models have various real-world applications, such as in medical image analysis. For example, a lightweight deep neural network (DNN) model that combines wavelet transforms with other techniques (like WDSI-LSO segmentation) has been shown to achieve high accuracy in lung cancer detection from 3D CT scan images. This demonstrates the effectiveness of wavelet-based models in practical applications.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Compressed State Spaces\n\n- Theoretical analysis of compressed state spaces involves understanding the trade-offs between compression and model capacity. Studies like those by Fu et al. and Liu et al. highlight the importance of careful algorithm design to balance these trade-offs. For instance, FlashFFTConv and Vision Mamba demonstrate how to efficiently process long sequences while maintaining model performance through principled theoretical motivations and bidirectional processing.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Multi-Resolution Processing**: Wavelet transforms provide a principled approach to multi-scale analysis, which can be crucial for autoregressive language models to capture various scales of information in sequences.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Implementations like Wav-KAN and FlashFFTConv show that careful algorithm design can significantly improve hardware utilization, enabling faster and more efficient processing of long sequences.\n- **Information Flow**: Theoretical analysis of information flow in compressed state spaces is essential to ensure that the compression techniques do not compromise the model's ability to capture and propagate relevant information. This involves understanding how wavelet transforms and other compression methods affect the state space representation.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and accurate autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of wavelet transforms and compressed state space models.\n",

Introduction\n\nA key challenge in sequence modeling is summarizing, or memorizing, long-term patterns in data informative for a particular task, such as classification, forecasting, or clustering. By definition, patterns are higher-level structures in the data that arise from multiple timesteps. However, patterns can oc-\n\n[^0]cur at multiple levels, corresponding to different timescales. For example, in studying energy consumption, patterned variations may occur within a day, between days, and quarterly. Similar salient multiscale trends appear in physiological time series such as dysfunctional glucose patterns in diabetic patients and anomalous heart beats in arrhythmic patients. Audio signals of speech may be described in terms of utterances, phonemes, and subphonemes. And, the multiscale structure of images and video has been well-studied. Even for data sources without an explicit multiscale interpretation, multiscale modeling approaches can provide an efficient mechanism for capturing long-range patterns. In this paper, we propose a general and reusable building block for sequence modeling-MultiresLaYERleveraging a multiscale approach to memorize past data. We view memory through the lens of multiresolution analysis (MRA) (Willsky, 2002), with a particular emphasis on wavelet analysis, a powerful tool from signal processing for compression, denoising, feature extraction, and more (Jawerth \\& Sweldens, 1994; Akansu et al., 2001). As discussed in Sec. 2, wavelet analyses can be computed in a computationally efficient manner and interpreted as a series of convolutions. However, our use of wavelets is a design choice and other MRA techniques could likewise be considered for memorizing patterns at different timescales. Taking inspiration from wavelets, the key component of MULTiresLaYer is a multiresolution convolution operation (MultiresCONV) that retains the overall tree-structure of MRA. We show that constructing a memory of the past at each timestep of the sequence using MultiresConV can be collectively implemented as a stack of carefully-placed dilated causal convolutions with filters shared between levels. In contrast to traditional wavelet analysis, however, we learn the filters and do so end-to-end. When we fix the filters to pre-defined wavelet filters, the MUltiresConv reduces to a traditional discrete wavelet transform, though we show the benefits of learning the filters in Sec. 5.5. The basic MultiresCONV building block can be stacked in a multitude of ways that are common in deep learning models (e.g., across multiple channels, vertically as multiple layers, etc.). Our model resembles WaveNet (Oord et al., 2016a) in the use of tree-structured dilated convolutions. However, our principle-guided design has distinct skip-connection structures and filter sharing patterns, resulting in significantly\nbetter parameter efficiency and performance (see Sec. 4 for further details). There is a rapidly growing literature on machine learning for sequence modeling. Popular classes of approaches include variants of recurrent networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997), self-attention networks (Vaswani et al., 2017), and state-space models (Gu et al., 2021).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/37 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n120-131.

Our MUlTIRESLAYER has key advantages over this body of past work:\n\n- Architecture simplicity: The workhorse of our layer is simple dilated convolutions and linear transforms. - Efficient training: Our layer parallelizes easily across hardware accelerators implementing convolutions. - Parameter efficiency: Our layer reuses filters across the stack of depthwise dilated convolutions. Likewise, by leveraging an MRA structure, we start from a principled and interpretable framework for thinking about memory in sequence modeling. Furthermore, we can lean on the vast MRA literature for modeling generalizations, such as shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) for shift-invariant representation learning, scaling to multiple input dimensions, etc. Our empirical evaluation covers sequential image classification and autoregressive generative modeling (CIFAR-10), reasoning on syntax trees (ListOps), and multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (PTB-XL). We also note that our proposed MULTIRESCONVs can readily be applied and extended to other tasks such as representation learning and long-term forecasting. Likewise, although we focus on sequence analysis, the ideas we propose generalize to other data domains with multiresolution structure, such as images and videos. Exploring the application of MULTIRESLAYER in these settings is an exciting future direction. ## 2. Background: Wavelet Decompositions\n\nIn contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of Fourier transforms, wavelets provide a time-frequency analysis. In particular, wavelets are a finite-support basis with a multiresolution structure, i.e., basis functions are divided into groups with different resolutions-some focus on \"local\" function values at very short timescales, while others capture more \"global\" structures at longer timescales. In the following, we explain the idea of wavelet MRA with the simplest wavelet family\u2014Haar wavelets. A formal treatment covering all orthogonal wavelets is in Appendix A. Suppose we want to approximate a signal $f(t)$ over the time interval $[0,1)$. The roughest approximation we can produce is $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(t) \\triangleq a_{0,0} \\phi(t)$ where $\\phi(t)=\\mathbf{1}(0 \\leq t<1)$ and $a_{0,0}=\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) d t$ is the average value of $f$. We use superscript 0 to indicate that this is the lowest resolution\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c73650bba3fd55f70b28g-02.jpg?height=830&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1081)\n\nFigure 1. In standard MRA, we approximate the continuous signal $f$ with $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$. Here, we visualize $\\hat{f}^{(3)}$ and its decomposition into a sum of functions that capture structures of increasing resolution over a binary-tree-partitioned input space, corresponding to Eq. (1). Components belonging to the same level have the same color. The non-transparent components of each resolution level retain the most recent information in the decomposition. Retaining only these components corresponds to our MULTIRESLAYER with a \"resolution fading\" TreESeLECT. approximation of $f$ we make. We can better approximate $f$ by dividing the unit interval in two and approximating $f$ as: $f(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(1)}(t) \\triangleq a_{1,0} \\phi(2 t)+a_{1,1} \\phi(2 t-1)$ where $a_{1,0}=\\int_{0}^{1 / 2} f(t) d t$ and $a_{1,1}=\\int_{1 / 2}^{1} f(t) d t$. We can repeat this procedure of halving the intervals, rescaling, and translating $\\phi$, to get finer approximations $\\left\\{\\hat{f}^{(j)}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. Each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is a linear combinations of compactly supported basis functions, $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}(t) \\triangleq 2^{j / 2} \\phi\\left(2^{j} t-k\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, with their resolution levels indexed by $j$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(j)}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{j, k} \\phi_{j, k}(t), \\text { where } a_{j, k}=\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, k}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor each level $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the subspace $V_{j} \\triangleq \\operatorname{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\right)$ contains functions that are constant over intervals of length $1 / 2^{j}$. In other words, basis functions in $V_{j}$ describe structures in $f$ no larger than the timescale of $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$. For sufficiently large $j, V_{j}$ has the capacity to approximate any continuous time series arbitrarily well. One may try to summarize or represent $f$ by collecting the coefficients $\\left\\{a_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ into a vector. Though the coefficients altogether fully describe the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$, each individual coefficient alone may be too local to be representative of structures in $f$. Each $a_{j, k}$ only summarizes the value of $f$\nwithin a $1 / 2^{j}$ interval, while patterns may occur over larger intervals. We would need multiple $a_{j, k}$ to summarize these larger-scale structures. Is there a way to produce coefficients each of which summarizes a structure at a different scale? Representing structure at disjoint resolutions. We can indeed produce this kind of representation by using tools from MRA. In MRA, we repeatedly decompose $V_{j}$ into the sum of a lower-resolution subspace $V_{j-1}$ and its orthogonal complement $W_{j-1}: V_{j}=V_{j-1} \\oplus W_{j-1}$. Since basis functions in $V_{j}$ and $V_{j-1}$ describe structures at scales coarser than $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$ and $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j-1}$, respectively, basis functions in $W_{j-1}$ represent structures exactly at the $1 / 2^{j}$ scale, summarized by the basis coefficients $\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. Starting from some high-resolution level $J$ and repeating this process, we have\n\n$$\nV_{J}=V_{J-1} \\oplus W_{J-1}=V_{0} \\oplus W_{0} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus W_{J-2} \\oplus W_{J-1}\n$$\n\nand, as visualized in Fig. 1,\n\n$$\nf(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(J)}(t)=a_{0,0} \\phi(t)+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{J-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} b_{j^{\\prime}, k} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}, k}(t)\n$$\n\nThe basis functions $\\left\\{\\psi_{j, k}\\right\\}$ are called Haar wavelets and $\\phi$ is called their scaling function; see Appendix A. 1 for their functional forms. The coefficients ${ }^{1}\\left\\{a_{0,0}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{b_{0, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\cup$ $\\ldots \\cup\\left\\{b_{J-1, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ now summarize the structures of $f$ at multiple resolutions, ranging from $1 / 2^{0}$ to $1 / 2^{J-1}$. Computing the representation. Our original problem of summarizing the multiresolution structures of $f$ then comes down to computing the wavelet basis coefficients $a_{0,0},\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}$ of the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(J)} \\in V_{J}$. See Appendix A. 1 for how to compute these coefficients for Haar wavelets. In general, we can efficiently and recursively compute these coefficients for any wavelet family using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT; see Appendix A.3). In Appendix D, we illustrate the representational power of wavelet transforms. In particular, we consider a raw audio waveform capturing 1 second of a recording at a sampling rate of 16,384 . We use a 10 -level wavelet tree with a total of 2068 coefficients used to reconstruct the audio signal. The wavelet transform is able to \"memorize\" many of the important patterns of the audio signal over this long sequence. This representational power motivates our MultiresLayer outlined in Sec.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/37 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n3. ## 3. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutions\n\nWe leverage the computation structure of DWT to construct a multiresolution memory for sequences. Given a sequence\n\n[^1]$\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ representing a discretely sampled signal, the DWT can be implemented by the following recursive computations for $\\mathbf{a}_{0}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1} \\triangleq\\left(\\mathbf{b}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{b}_{J-1}\\right)$ starting from $\\mathbf{a}_{J}(n)=\\mathbf{x}(n)^{2}:$\n\\[\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{a}_{j}(n) \\triangleq a_{j, n} & =\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\mathbf{a}_{j+1}(2 n+k) \\mathbf{h}_{0}(k) \\\\\n\\mathbf{b}_{j}(n) \\triangleq b_{j, n} & =\\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \\mathbf{a}_{j+1}(2 n+k) \\mathbf{h}_{1}(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\\]\n\nwhere the filters $\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{K}$ are determined by the class of wavelets. For Haar wavelets, we have $\\mathbf{h}_{0}=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{1}=\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$. To decouple the underlying computation from the choice of filters, we define this procedure composed of convolution and downsampling at multiple scales as the multiresolution convolution operation:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1}=\\operatorname{MULTIRESCONV}\\left(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1}, J\\right)\n$$\n\nRecall, the coefficients $\\left\\{\\mathbf{a}_{0}(n)\\right\\}$ and $\\left\\{\\mathbf{b}_{j}(n)\\right\\}$ serve as a multiresolution representation of $\\mathbf{x}$. When the filter values come from wavelets, we can perfectly reconstruct the original sequence $\\mathbf{x}$ from the coefficients $\\mathbf{a}_{0}, \\mathbf{b}_{0: J-1}$ by inverting the recursive procedure. In other words, this procedure is powerful enough to give us perfect memory of the past, summarized by the coefficients. Instead of setting the filters to fixed values, however, we propose to use MUltiresCONV as a building block for sequence models by letting $\\mathbf{h}_{0}, \\mathbf{h}_{1}$ be learnable. Learning the filters allows us to go beyond hand-designed wavelets while still keeping the multiresolution structure in our computation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nWe do not observe statistically significant differences between the approaches. This demonstrates the advantage of our model over S4-related methods that require careful initialization. Memory mechanism. We do not notice a statistically significant difference between uniform and resolution fading, though resolution fading provides a simpler implementation. Importance of receptive fields. Finally, we show that we can significantly improve the performance of this model by increasing either the filter size (Experiment 2 vs. 6) or the depth of the MultiresConv (Experiment 3 vs. 4). We believe this is because both changes increase the receptive field size of the MultiresConV operation, which is particularly important for reasoning tasks like ListOps. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe presented MultiresLayer for robust and efficient memorization of long-term patterns in sequential data sources. It takes inspiration from the multiresolution analysis (MRA) literature, building on wavelet decompositions, to memorize patterns occurring at multiple timescales. In particular, our memory is generated by multiresolution convolutions, implemented as dilated causal convolutions with learned filters shared between tree levels that are connected via purely linear operations. To create the memory, all multiresolution values may be maintained, or more emphasis can be placed on more recent time points by leveraging the time-localized nature of wavelet transforms. The resulting MUltiReSNET garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks while being defined by dramatically fewer parameters than competitor models, all while achieving state-of-the-art performance in a number of benchmark sequence modeling tasks. These experiments demonstrate the portability of our multiresolution memory structure to a number of tasks, even in cases where a given task may not intuitively be viewed in a multiscale fashion (e.g., syntax tree parsing in ListOps). By taking inspiration from the wavelet literature, we built an effective convolutional layer with dramatically fewer parameters without taking a performance hit. The principled underpinnings of the MultiresCONV ensure it possesses a configuration with strong reconstruction capabilities (e.g., when our filters equal the wavelet filters); however, as we showed, predictive performance can be improved by learning the filters. Another potential benefit of starting from the wavelet framework is the ability to leverage that vast literature in that\ndomain for future modeling advances. In particular, we plan to explore the utility of MUltiresCONV in representation learning and long-term forecasting. For representation learning, we can consider the structure of shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) to target representations that are invariant to shifts of the input signals. For example, we may want to cluster individuals with similar ECG signals even if the key signatures are shifted relative to one another. Wavelets may also be extended to image analysis, enabling video analysis in our sequential setting. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported in part by AFOSR Grant FA955021-1-0397, ONR Grant N00014-22-1-2110, the National Science Foundation under grant 2205084, and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).

PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive wavelet distillation from neural networks through interpretations\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*Wooseok Ha, Chandan Singh, F. Lanusse, E. Song, Song Dang, Kangmin He, S. Upadhyayula, Bin Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adapt wavelet distillation (AWD) is proposed, a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform and yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacrifice interpretability and computational efficiency. Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield computational efficiency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform. Specifically, AWD penalizes feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly predictive, concise, computationally efficient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases, AWD yields a scientifically interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD identifies predictive features that are scientifically meaningful in the context of respective domains.

Rethinking Graph Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*Jianheng Tang, Jiajin Li, Zi-Chao Gao, Jia Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN), which has spectral and spatial localized band-pass filters to better handle the `right-shift' phenomenon in anomalies.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely applied for graph anomaly detection. As one of the key components for GNN design is to select a tailored spectral filter, we take the first step towards analyzing anomalies via the lens of the graph spectrum. Our crucial observation is the existence of anomalies will lead to the `right-shift' phenomenon, that is, the spectral energy distribution concentrates less on low frequencies and more on high frequencies. This fact motivates us to propose the Beta Wavelet Graph Neural Network (BWGNN). Indeed, BWGNN has spectral and spatial localized band-pass filters to better handle the `right-shift' phenomenon in anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BWGNN on four large-scale anomaly detection datasets.

Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5.

The mainstream approaches for runtime acceleration consist in pruning connections (unstructured pruning) or, better, filters (structured pruning), both often requiring data to re-train the model. In this paper, we present RED, a data-free structured, unified approach to tackle structured pruning. First, we propose a novel adaptive hashing of the scalar DNN weight distribution densities to increase the number of identical neurons represented by their weight vectors. Second, we prune the network by merging redundant neurons based on their relative similarities, as defined by their distance. Third, we propose a novel uneven depthwise separation technique to further prune convolutional layers. We demonstrate through a large variety of benchmarks that RED largely outperforms other data-free pruning methods, often reaching performance similar to unconstrained, data-driven methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Multi-level Wavelet Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural networks*\n\n*WangMeng Zuo, Wei Lian, Pengju Liu, Hongzhi Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** In computer vision, convolutional networks (CNNs) often adopts pooling to enlarge receptive field which has the advantage of low computational complexity. However, pooling can cause information loss and thus is detrimental to further operations such as features extraction and analysis. Recently, dilated filter has been proposed to trade off between receptive field size and efficiency. But the accompanying gridding effect can cause a sparse sampling of input images with checkerboard patterns. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-level wavelet CNN (MWCNN) model to achieve better trade-off between receptive field size and computational efficiency. The core idea is to embed wavelet transform into CNN architecture to reduce the resolution of feature maps while at the same time, increasing receptive field. Specifically, MWCNN for image restoration is based on U-Net architecture, and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) is deployed to reconstruct the high resolution (HR) feature maps. The proposed MWCNN can also be viewed as an improvement of dilated filter and a generalization of average pooling, and can be applied to not only image restoration tasks, but also any CNNs requiring a pooling operation. The experimental results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed MWCNN for tasks such as image denoising, single image super-resolution, JPEG image artifacts removal and object classification.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Accelerating Deep Unsupervised Domain Adaptation with Transfer Channel Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression neural networks*\n\n*Jindong Wang, Chaohui Yu, Zijing Wu, Yiqiang Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has recently received increasing\nattention from researchers. However, existing methods are computationally\nintensive due to the computation cost of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\nadopted by most work. To date, there is no effective network compression method\nfor accelerating these models. In this paper, we propose a unified Transfer\nChannel Pruning (TCP) approach for accelerating UDA models. TCP is capable of\ncompressing the deep UDA model by pruning less important channels while\nsimultaneously learning transferable features by reducing the cross-domain\ndistribution divergence. Therefore, it reduces the impact of negative transfer\nand maintains competitive performance on the target task. To the best of our\nknowledge, TCP is the first approach that aims at accelerating deep UDA models.\nTCP is validated on two benchmark datasets-Office-31 and ImageCLEF-DA with two\ncommon backbone networks-VGG16 and ResNet50. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat TCP achieves comparable or better classification accuracy than other\ncomparison methods while significantly reducing the computational cost. To be\nmore specific, in VGG16, we get even higher accuracy after pruning 26% floating\npoint operations (FLOPs); in ResNet50, we also get higher accuracy on half of\nthe tasks after pruning 12% FLOPs. We hope that TCP will open a new door for\nfuture research on accelerating transfer learning models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using the integration of wavelets, adaptive compression, and multi-resolution processing, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and details:\n\n## Integration of Wavelets with Neural Networks\n\n- The use of wavelet transforms in neural networks is well-documented, particularly in image processing. For instance, the incorporation of wavelet transforms can enhance the receptive fields of models, which is crucial for capturing global and local correlations. In the context of sequence modeling, wavelets can be used to decompose sequences into different frequency components, allowing for multi-resolution analysis. The paper on \"Window-based Channel Attention for Wavelet-enhanced Learned Image Compression\" discusses the use of Haar wavelet transforms to enlarge receptive fields and capture frequency correlations, which could be adapted for sequence modeling.\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques in Sequence Modeling\n\n- Adaptive compression mechanisms are essential for efficient sequence modeling. In the context of image compression, techniques like importance scoring and conditional autoencoders have been explored. For sequence models, adaptive compression could involve dynamically selecting the most relevant features or frequency bands to compress, ensuring minimal loss of information. The concept of \"Causal Context Adjustment Loss\" for learned image compression could be extended to sequence models, where the model adapts the compression based on the context and importance of the sequence elements.\n\n## Multi-Resolution Processing for Long Sequences\n\n- Multi-resolution processing is critical for handling long sequences efficiently. By decomposing sequences into different frequency bands using wavelet transforms, models can process each band in parallel, reducing computational overhead. This approach is similar to the multi-resolution convolutional memory models mentioned in your initial observations. The paper on \"Window-based Channel Attention for Wavelet-enhanced Learned Image Compression\" also highlights the use of wavelet transforms for frequency-dependent down-sampling, which can be applied to sequence models to process different frequency components separately.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Wavelet Transforms\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations of wavelet transforms are crucial for practical deployment. The Haar wavelet transform, for example, is simple and efficient, requiring no learning parameters and performing a sum-pooling operation to down-sample the input. This makes it a viable choice for hardware implementation. The discussion on Haar wavelet transforms in the context of image compression can be extended to sequence models, ensuring that the wavelet transforms do not add significant computational overhead.\n\n## Information Preservation in Compressed Neural Representations\n\n- Ensuring information preservation in compressed neural representations is vital. Theoretical guarantees for information preservation can be derived from the properties of wavelet transforms and the adaptive compression mechanisms. For instance, the use of importance scoring and conditional autoencoders can provide guarantees on the amount of information retained during compression. The paper on \"OCNNA\" for optimizing CNN architectures discusses techniques for simplifying neural networks while maintaining accuracy, which could be adapted to ensure information preservation in compressed sequence models.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs) Integration**: Combining wavelet transforms with SSMs, as proposed in the WaveletSSD, requires a deep understanding of both wavelet theory and SSMs. The integration can potentially offer better feature representation at multiple scales, but it also introduces complexity. Researching existing work on wavelet-based sequence modeling and the theoretical foundations of combining wavelets with SSMs will be essential.\n\n- **Scalability and Efficiency**: To ensure the model scales well with sequence length, parallel processing techniques for multi-resolution analysis should be explored. The efficiency of the wavelet transform implementation and the adaptive compression mechanism will be critical in maintaining performance as the sequence length increases.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages wavelet transforms for multi-resolution analysis, employs adaptive compression techniques for efficiency, and ensures hardware-efficient implementations while preserving critical information in the compressed representations.\n",

While the capabilities of SSMs have been primarily investigated through experimental comparisons, theoretical understanding of SSMs is still limited. In particular, there is a lack of statistical and quantitative evaluation of whether SSM can replace Transformers. In this paper, we theoretically explore in which tasks SSMs can be alternatives of Transformers from the perspective of estimating sequence-to-sequence functions. We consider the setting where the target function has direction-dependent smoothness and prove that SSMs can estimate such functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers. Additionally, we prove that SSMs can estimate the target function, even if the smoothness changes depending on the input sequence, as well as Transformers. Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/38 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nN.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4. The Illusion of State in State-Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.51)\n\n*William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Analysis of state-space models reveals that SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill&Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the\"state\"in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/39 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\narXiv:2312.00752.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3. How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections\n\n*From Search Query: state space models adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes RNN heuristics, temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations while addressing their shortcomings, and introduces a trainable subset of structured matrices that endow LSSLs with long-range memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), temporal convolutions, and neural differential equations (NDEs) are popular families of deep learning models for time-series data, each with unique strengths and tradeoffs in modeling power and computational efficiency. We introduce a simple sequence model inspired by control systems that generalizes these approaches while addressing their shortcomings. The Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL) maps a sequence $u \\mapsto y$ by simply simulating a linear continuous-time state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax + Bu, y = Cx + Du$. Theoretically, we show that LSSL models are closely related to the three aforementioned families of models and inherit their strengths. For example, they generalize convolutions to continuous-time, explain common RNN heuristics, and share features of NDEs such as time-scale adaptation. We then incorporate and generalize recent theory on continuous-time memorization to introduce a trainable subset of structured matrices $A$ that endow LSSLs with long-range memory. Empirically, stacking LSSL layers into a simple deep neural network obtains state-of-the-art results across time series benchmarks for long dependencies in sequential image classification, real-world healthcare regression tasks, and speech. On a difficult speech classification task with length-16000 sequences, LSSL outperforms prior approaches by 24 accuracy points, and even outperforms baselines that use hand-crafted features on 100x shorter sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 351  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 6. Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space model theory*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W.

Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Peter W. Battaglia, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, Meire Fortunato, Tobias Pfaff*\n\n**Abstract:** Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.\n\n**Conference:** learning-mesh-based-simulation-with-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Relation-centered Pooling and Convolution for Heterogeneous Graph Learning Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Jiong Jin, Xiaowei Huang, Xin Chen, Youhua Xia, Yao Yao, Yuze Liu, Tiehua Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous graph neural network has unleashed great potential on graph representation learning and shown superior performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and clustering. Existing heterogeneous graph learning networks are primarily designed to either rely on pre-defined meta-paths or use attention mechanisms for type-specific attentive message propagation on different nodes/edges, incurring many customization efforts and computational costs. To this end, we design a relation-centered Pooling and Convolution for Heterogeneous Graph learning Network, namely PC-HGN, to enable relation-specific sampling and cross-relation convolutions, from which the structural heterogeneity of the graph can be better encoded into the embedding space through the adaptive training process. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model by comparing with state-of-the-art graph learning models on three different real-world datasets, and the results show that PC-HGN consistently outperforms all the baseline and improves the performance maximumly up by 17.8%.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multiresolution Graph Transformers and Wavelet Positional Encoding for Learning Hierarchical Structures\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet state space model theory*\n\n*Risi Kondor, Truong Son Hy, Nhat Khang Ngo*\n\n**Abstract:** Contemporary graph learning algorithms are not well-defined for large molecules since they do not consider the hierarchical interactions among the atoms, which are essential to determine the molecular properties of macromolecules. In this work, we propose Multiresolution Graph Transformers (MGT), the first graph transformer architecture that can learn to represent large molecules at multiple scales. MGT can learn to produce representations for the atoms and group them into meaningful functional groups or repeating units. We also introduce Wavelet Positional Encoding (WavePE), a new positional encoding method that can guarantee localization in both spectral and spatial domains. Our proposed model achieves competitive results on two macromolecule datasets consisting of polymers and peptides, and one drug-like molecule dataset. Importantly, our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods and achieves chemical accuracy in estimating molecular properties (e.g., GAP, HOMO and LUMO) calculated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) in the polymers dataset. Furthermore, the visualizations, including clustering results on macromolecules and low-dimensional spaces of their representations, demonstrate the capability of our methodology in learning to represent long-range and hierarchical structures.

Papers like Shi et al. (2023) provide a theoretical foundation by using wavelet-based multiresolution analysis for sequence modeling. This approach leverages the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions[5,.\n\n## Adaptive Mechanisms in State Space Models\n\n- Adaptive mechanisms are crucial for enhancing the performance and flexibility of state space models. The work on SC-MAMBA2, for instance, integrates state-space models with adaptive architectures to handle large-scale biological data efficiently. This model uses bidirectional contextual relationships and adapts to the unique characteristics of single-cell data, demonstrating superior performance in various tasks.\n\n## Information Preservation in Compressed State Representations\n\n- Information preservation is a critical aspect when compressing state representations. The information bottleneck theory suggests that compression can improve generalization, but it requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between compression and performance. Studies like Gabri\u00e9 et al. (2018) examine the behavior of entropies and mutual informations throughout learning, highlighting the importance of balancing compression and generalization[3,.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of State Space Models\n\n- Hardware efficiency can be achieved through proper design choices, such as the use of specific wavelets (e.g., Haar wavelets) and parallelization of multi-resolution processing. The implementation of MultiresConv, as described by Shi et al. (2023), can be done with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, making it computationally efficient[5,.\n\n## Multi-Resolution Processing in State Space Architectures\n\n- Multi-resolution processing is a key feature that can be integrated into state space architectures. This is evident in the work on adaptive wavelet distillation, where Ha et al. (2021) penalize feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. This approach results in models that are highly predictive, concise, and computationally efficient[2,.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **State Space Duality**: The concept of State Space Duality (SSD) introduced in SC-MAMBA2 simplifies the matrix transformations, making it more suitable for implementation in modern computational frameworks. This can be particularly useful in integrating wavelet transforms with state space models.\n\n- **Adaptive Estimators**: Adaptive estimators, as discussed in Chelombiev et al. (2019), show information compression in deep neural networks, which can be applied to state space models to enhance their adaptive capabilities and efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of state space models, wavelet transforms, and adaptive mechanisms, potentially leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory  (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Jiaxin Shi, Ke Alexander Wang, E. Fox*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2023)\t**Cited by** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The key component of the model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence, and can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree, garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nSee Sec. 4 for further discussion. Our MUlTIRESLAYER has key advantages over this body of past work:\n\n- Architecture simplicity: The workhorse of our layer is simple dilated convolutions and linear transforms. - Efficient training: Our layer parallelizes easily across hardware accelerators implementing convolutions. - Parameter efficiency: Our layer reuses filters across the stack of depthwise dilated convolutions. Likewise, by leveraging an MRA structure, we start from a principled and interpretable framework for thinking about memory in sequence modeling. Furthermore, we can lean on the vast MRA literature for modeling generalizations, such as shift-invariant wavelet transforms (Kingsbury, 1998; Selesnick et al., 2005) for shift-invariant representation learning, scaling to multiple input dimensions, etc. Our empirical evaluation covers sequential image classification and autoregressive generative modeling (CIFAR-10), reasoning on syntax trees (ListOps), and multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (PTB-XL). We also note that our proposed MULTIRESCONVs can readily be applied and extended to other tasks such as representation learning and long-term forecasting. Likewise, although we focus on sequence analysis, the ideas we propose generalize to other data domains with multiresolution structure, such as images and videos. Exploring the application of MULTIRESLAYER in these settings is an exciting future direction. ## 2. Background: Wavelet Decompositions\n\nIn contrast to the frequency-domain analysis of Fourier transforms, wavelets provide a time-frequency analysis. In particular, wavelets are a finite-support basis with a multiresolution structure, i.e., basis functions are divided into groups with different resolutions-some focus on \"local\" function values at very short timescales, while others capture more \"global\" structures at longer timescales. In the following, we explain the idea of wavelet MRA with the simplest wavelet family\u2014Haar wavelets. A formal treatment covering all orthogonal wavelets is in Appendix A. Suppose we want to approximate a signal $f(t)$ over the time interval $[0,1)$. The roughest approximation we can produce is $\\hat{f}^{(0)}(t) \\triangleq a_{0,0} \\phi(t)$ where $\\phi(t)=\\mathbf{1}(0 \\leq t<1)$ and $a_{0,0}=\\int_{0}^{1} f(t) d t$ is the average value of $f$. We use superscript 0 to indicate that this is the lowest resolution\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_c73650bba3fd55f70b28g-02.jpg?height=830&width=765&top_left_y=233&top_left_x=1081)\n\nFigure 1. In standard MRA, we approximate the continuous signal $f$ with $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$. Here, we visualize $\\hat{f}^{(3)}$ and its decomposition into a sum of functions that capture structures of increasing resolution over a binary-tree-partitioned input space, corresponding to Eq. (1). Components belonging to the same level have the same color. The non-transparent components of each resolution level retain the most recent information in the decomposition. Retaining only these components corresponds to our MULTIRESLAYER with a \"resolution fading\" TreESeLECT. approximation of $f$ we make. We can better approximate $f$ by dividing the unit interval in two and approximating $f$ as: $f(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(1)}(t) \\triangleq a_{1,0} \\phi(2 t)+a_{1,1} \\phi(2 t-1)$ where $a_{1,0}=\\int_{0}^{1 / 2} f(t) d t$ and $a_{1,1}=\\int_{1 / 2}^{1} f(t) d t$. We can repeat this procedure of halving the intervals, rescaling, and translating $\\phi$, to get finer approximations $\\left\\{\\hat{f}^{(j)}\\right\\}_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}}$. Each $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$ is a linear combinations of compactly supported basis functions, $\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}(t) \\triangleq 2^{j / 2} \\phi\\left(2^{j} t-k\\right)\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$, with their resolution levels indexed by $j$ :\n\n$$\n\\hat{f}^{(j)}(t)=\\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} a_{j, k} \\phi_{j, k}(t), \\text { where } a_{j, k}=\\left\\langle f, \\phi_{j, k}\\right\\rangle\n$$\n\nFor each level $j \\in \\mathbb{N}_{0}$, the subspace $V_{j} \\triangleq \\operatorname{span}\\left(\\left\\{\\phi_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}\\right)$ contains functions that are constant over intervals of length $1 / 2^{j}$. In other words, basis functions in $V_{j}$ describe structures in $f$ no larger than the timescale of $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$. For sufficiently large $j, V_{j}$ has the capacity to approximate any continuous time series arbitrarily well. One may try to summarize or represent $f$ by collecting the coefficients $\\left\\{a_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ into a vector. Though the coefficients altogether fully describe the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(j)}$, each individual coefficient alone may be too local to be representative of structures in $f$. Each $a_{j, k}$ only summarizes the value of $f$\nwithin a $1 / 2^{j}$ interval, while patterns may occur over larger intervals. We would need multiple $a_{j, k}$ to summarize these larger-scale structures. Is there a way to produce coefficients each of which summarizes a structure at a different scale? Representing structure at disjoint resolutions. We can indeed produce this kind of representation by using tools from MRA. In MRA, we repeatedly decompose $V_{j}$ into the sum of a lower-resolution subspace $V_{j-1}$ and its orthogonal complement $W_{j-1}: V_{j}=V_{j-1} \\oplus W_{j-1}$. Since basis functions in $V_{j}$ and $V_{j-1}$ describe structures at scales coarser than $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j}$ and $\\Delta t \\sim 1 / 2^{j-1}$, respectively, basis functions in $W_{j-1}$ represent structures exactly at the $1 / 2^{j}$ scale, summarized by the basis coefficients $\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$. Starting from some high-resolution level $J$ and repeating this process, we have\n\n$$\nV_{J}=V_{J-1} \\oplus W_{J-1}=V_{0} \\oplus W_{0} \\oplus \\ldots \\oplus W_{J-2} \\oplus W_{J-1}\n$$\n\nand, as visualized in Fig. 1,\n\n$$\nf(t) \\approx \\hat{f}^{(J)}(t)=a_{0,0} \\phi(t)+\\sum_{j^{\\prime}=0}^{J-1} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} b_{j^{\\prime}, k} \\psi_{j^{\\prime}, k}(t)\n$$\n\nThe basis functions $\\left\\{\\psi_{j, k}\\right\\}$ are called Haar wavelets and $\\phi$ is called their scaling function; see Appendix A. 1 for their functional forms. The coefficients ${ }^{1}\\left\\{a_{0,0}\\right\\} \\cup\\left\\{b_{0, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}} \\cup$ $\\ldots \\cup\\left\\{b_{J-1, k}\\right\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{Z}}$ now summarize the structures of $f$ at multiple resolutions, ranging from $1 / 2^{0}$ to $1 / 2^{J-1}$. Computing the representation. Our original problem of summarizing the multiresolution structures of $f$ then comes down to computing the wavelet basis coefficients $a_{0,0},\\left\\{b_{j, k}\\right\\}$ of the approximation $\\hat{f}^{(J)} \\in V_{J}$. See Appendix A. 1 for how to compute these coefficients for Haar wavelets. In general, we can efficiently and recursively compute these coefficients for any wavelet family using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT; see Appendix A.3). In Appendix D, we illustrate the representational power of wavelet transforms. In particular, we consider a raw audio waveform capturing 1 second of a recording at a sampling rate of 16,384 . We use a 10 -level wavelet tree with a total of 2068 coefficients used to reconstruct the audio signal. The wavelet transform is able to \"memorize\" many of the important patterns of the audio signal over this long sequence. This representational power motivates our MultiresLayer outlined in Sec.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/37 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\n120-131. Citeseer, 1998.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.23)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/46 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP), pages 4779-4783.

Score: 0.17)\n\n*Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 12  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/35 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2403.03234, 2024.

T-WaveNet: A Tree-Structured Wavelet Neural Network for Time Series Signal Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural network implementation*\n\n*Minhao Liu, Ailing Zeng, Qiuxia Lai, Ruiyuan Gao, Min Li, Jing Qin, Qiang Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel tree-structured wavelet neural network for time series signal analysis, namely T-WaveNet, takes advantage of an inherent property of various types of signals, known as the dominant frequency range, to facilitate a more effective extraction of the discriminative features.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series signal analysis plays an essential role in many applications, e.g., activity recognition and healthcare monitoring. Recently, features extracted with deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown to be more effective than conventional hand-crafted ones. However, most existing solutions rely solely on the network to extract information carried in the raw signal, regardless of its inherent physical and statistical properties, leading to sub-optimal performance particularly under a limited amount of training data. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured wavelet neural network for time series signal analysis, namely T-WaveNet, taking advantage of an inherent property of various types of signals, known as the dominant frequency range. Specifically, with T-WaveNet, we first conduct frequency spectrum energy analysis of the signals to get a set of dominant frequency subbands. Then, we construct a tree-structured network that iteratively decomposes the input signal into various frequency subbands with similar energies. Each node on the tree is built with an invertible neural network (INN) based wavelet transform unit. Such a disentangled representation learning method facilitates a more effective extraction of the discriminative features, as demonstrated with the comprehensive experiments on various real-life time series classification datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Distilled Gradient Aggregation: Purify Features for Input Attribution in the Deep Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural network implementation*\n\n*Giyoung Jeon, Haedong Jeong, Jaesik Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs a new input attribution method which adopt the strengths of both local and global attributions, and proposes a novel approach to distill input features using weak and extremely positive contributor masks.\n\n**Abstract:** Measuring the attribution of input features toward the model output is one of the popular post-hoc explanations on the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Among various approaches to compute the attribution, the gradient-based methods are widely used to generate attributions, because of its ease of implementation and the model-agnostic characteristic. However, existing gradient integration methods such as Integrated Gradients (IG) suffer from (1) the noisy attributions which cause the unreliability of the explanation, and (2) the selection for the integration path which determines the quality of explanations. FullGrad (FG) is an another approach to construct the reliable attributions by focusing the locality of piece-wise linear network with the bias gradient. Although FG has shown reasonable performance for the given input, as the shortage of the global property, FG is vulnerable to the small perturbation, while IG which includes the exploration over the input space is robust. In this work, we design a new input attribution method which adopt the strengths of both local and global attributions. In particular, we propose a novel approach to distill input features using weak and extremely positive contributor masks. We aggregate the intermediate local attributions obtained from the distillation sequence to provide reliable attribution. We perform the quantitative evaluation compared to various attribution methods and show that our method outperforms others. We also provide the qualitative result that our method obtains object-aligned and sharp attribution heatmap.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient state space models*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient state space models*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient state space models*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Graph Wavelet Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural network implementation*\n\n*Xue-Qi Cheng, Hua-Wei Shen, Yunqi Qiu, Qi Cao, Bingbing Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** We present graph wavelet neural network (GWNN), a novel graph convolutional\nneural network (CNN), leveraging graph wavelet transform to address the\nshortcomings of previous spectral graph CNN methods that depend on graph\nFourier transform. Different from graph Fourier transform, graph wavelet\ntransform can be obtained via a fast algorithm without requiring matrix\neigendecomposition with high computational cost. Moreover, graph wavelets are\nsparse and localized in vertex domain, offering high efficiency and good\ninterpretability for graph convolution.

Learning filter widths of spectral decompositions with wavelets\n\n*From Search Query: wavelet neural network implementation*\n\n*Bulent Yener, Haidar Khan*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series classification using deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), operate on the spectral decomposition of the time series computed using a preprocessing step. This step can include a large number of hyperparameters, such as window length, filter widths, and filter shapes, each with a range of possible values that must be chosen using time and data intensive cross-validation procedures. We propose the wavelet deconvolution (WD) layer as an efficient alternative to this preprocessing step that eliminates a significant number of hyperparameters. The WD layer uses wavelet functions with adjustable scale parameters to learn the spectral decomposition directly from the signal. Using backpropagation, we show the scale parameters can be optimized with gradient descent. Furthermore, the WD layer adds interpretability to the learned time series classifier by exploiting the properties of the wavelet transform. In our experiments, we show that the WD layer can automatically extract the frequency content used to generate a dataset. The WD layer combined with a CNN applied to the phone recognition task on the TIMIT database achieves a phone error rate of 18.1\\%, a relative improvement of 4\\% over the baseline CNN. Experiments on a dataset where engineered features are not available showed WD+CNN is the best performing method. Our results show that the WD layer can improve neural network based time series classifiers both in accuracy and interpretability by learning directly from the input signal.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2018-12\n\n**Published:** 2018-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient state space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Stripe: Tensor Compilation via the Nested Polyhedral Model\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient state space models*\n\n*Tim Zerrell, Jeremy Bruestle*\n\n**Abstract:** Hardware architectures and machine learning (ML) libraries evolve rapidly.\nTraditional compilers often fail to generate high-performance code across the\nspectrum of new hardware offerings. To mitigate, engineers develop hand-tuned\nkernels for each ML library update and hardware upgrade. Unfortunately, this\napproach requires excessive engineering effort to scale or maintain with any\ndegree of state-of-the-art performance. Here we present a Nested Polyhedral\nModel for representing highly parallelizable computations with limited\ndependencies between iterations. This model provides an underlying framework\nfor an intermediate representation (IR) called Stripe, amenable to standard\ncompiler techniques while naturally modeling key aspects of modern ML\ncomputing. Stripe represents parallelism, efficient memory layout, and multiple\ncompute units at a level of abstraction amenable to automatic optimization. We\ndescribe how Stripe enables a compiler for ML in the style of LLVM that allows\nindependent development of algorithms, optimizations, and hardware\naccelerators. We also discuss the design exploration advantages of Stripe over\nkernel libraries and schedule-based or schedule-space-based code generation.\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using wavelets and optimizing state space models, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Specific Implementations of Wavelets in Neural Networks\n\n- The integration of wavelets in neural networks can enhance the model's ability to capture multi-resolution features. For instance, the work by Shi et al. (2023) mentions the use of \"multiresolution convolution\" which combines the advantages of convolutional networks with the theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. This approach captures multiscale trends in input sequences, which can be beneficial for autoregressive models.\n\n- Another example is the use of wavelet activation functions in neural networks. Uddin et al. studied the impact of various wavelet activation functions in approximating non-linear differential equations, showing that wavelet activation functions can provide better accuracy compared to traditional activation functions like tanh.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for State Space Models\n\n- For hardware efficiency, the use of diagonal state matrices in state space models (SSMs) is crucial. Gu et al. (2022) and Yu et al. (2023) discuss how diagonal state matrices can preserve performance while simplifying the implementation, making them more hardware-efficient. The \"perturb-then-diagonalize\" (PTD) methodology introduced by Yu et al. can be particularly useful for stabilizing and simplifying SSMs.\n\n## Efficient Wavelet Transform Algorithms\n\n- The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is an efficient algorithm for wavelet transforms. It allows for multi-scale decomposition of signals with a computational complexity of O(N), which is more efficient than the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for certain applications. The DWT can be computed online and is suitable for streaming data, making it a viable choice for real-time processing in autoregressive models.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of SSMs\n\n- Structured state space models can be designed to be memory-efficient. The work by Lu et al. (2023) on \"Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\" provides insights into how structured parameterizations can reduce the memory footprint of SSMs while maintaining their performance.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Wavelet-Based Neural Architectures\n\n- The performance of wavelet-based neural architectures can be significantly improved by careful choice of wavelet functions and integration strategies. For example, Tan et al. used a modified metaheuristic algorithm with Gaussian wavelet activation functions to solve elliptic PDEs, achieving better accuracy compared to other optimization methods.\n\n- The OCNNA method proposed in the MDPI article introduces a way to simplify convolutional neural networks using wavelet transforms, which can also be applied to state space models. This method measures the importance of each convolutional layer and unit, leading to more efficient and precise models.\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Wavelet Integration**: Using multiresolution convolution and wavelet activation functions can enhance the ability of autoregressive models to capture different timescales and improve accuracy.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Diagonal state matrices and efficient wavelet transform algorithms like DWT can simplify and optimize the implementation of state space models.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Structured parameterizations in state space models can reduce memory footprint while maintaining performance.\n- **Performance Analysis**: Careful choice of wavelet functions and integration strategies can significantly improve the performance of wavelet-based neural architectures.\n\nThese insights and techniques can help researchers design more efficient, scalable, and accurate autoregressive language models.\n",

    "abstract": "We propose WaveletSSD, a novel variant of SSDMinimalDiscrete that integrates wavelet-based multi-resolution analysis with state space models. By decomposing the input sequence into frequency subbands and applying adaptive compression through Haar wavelets, our design achieves efficient processing of long sequences while maintaining high fidelity in capturing both local and global dependencies. The resulting WaveMamba2 model demonstrates improved performance in terms of perplexity and computational efficiency compared to the baseline Mamba2.",
